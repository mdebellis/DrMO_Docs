128, Effect of Decontamination and Cleaning on the Shear Bond Strength of High Translucency Zirconia,"S. Krifka, V. Preis and M. Rosentritt", Dent J (Basel)," (1) Background: This study evaluated the bonding performance of high translucency zirconia after diverse surficial decontamination and cleaning procedures. (2) Methods: High translucency zirconia (Lava(TM) Esthetic) specimens (2.0 mm × 20 mm × 10 mm) were exposed to different surface treatments prior to bonding to CoCr cylinders (d = 5 mm, height = 3 mm). All surfaces were sandblasted (40 µm aluminum oxide, 2 bar) and treated with alcohol (al), saliva (s), saliva + water (sw), or saliva + NaOCl + water (sn) before bonding was performed with the following adhesive luting systems: RelyX(TM) Unicem 2 (RX), Scotchbond(TM) Universal (SBU) + RelyX(TM) Ultimate (RU) or Monobond Plus (MP) + Multilink(®) Automix (ML). After 24 h, thermocycling (TC:12,000 × 5 °C/55 °C) and 90 days of storage at 37 °C in distilled water, the shear bond strength (SBS) was evaluated according to ISO/TS 11,405:2015. Failure modes along bonding areas were characterized. Means and standard deviations (n = 10 per group) were determined and statistically analyzed with one-way ANOVA/Bonferroni (α = 0.05). (3) Results: The SBS after 24 h varied between 3.5 (sRX) and 69.4 MPa (snMP + ML). Values from 0 (sRX) to 70.3 MPa (swRX) were found after TC. Data after 90 days of storage showed the lowest values for sRX (0 MPa) and the highest values for alSBU + RU (75.5 MPa). Adhesive failure was noted at all aging conditions. (4) Conclusions: SBU + RU or RX and MP + ML including saliva decontamination of the ceramic surface with water or NaOCl + water allow efficient bonding to Lava(TM) Esthetic.",2017,0,0,
526, Weak Fragment Crystallizable (Fc) Domain Interactions Drive the Dynamic Assembly of IgG Oligomers upon Antigen Recognition,"J. Strasser, R. N. de Jong, F. J. Beurskens, J. Schuurman, P. Parren, P. Hinterdorfer and J. Preiner", ACS Nano," Activation of membrane receptors through clustering is a common mechanism found in various biological systems. Spatial proximity of receptors may be transduced across the membrane to initiate signaling pathways or alternatively be recognized by peripheral proteins or immune cells to trigger external effector functions. Here we show how specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding induces clustering of monomeric target molecules in lipid membranes through Fc-Fc interactions. We visualize and characterize the dynamic IgG oligomerization process and the molecular interactions involved using high-speed atomic force microscopy, single-molecule force spectroscopy, and quartz crystal microbalance experiments. We found that the Fc-Fc interaction strength is precisely tuned to be weak enough to prevent IgG oligomerization in solution at physiological titers, but enabling IgG oligomerization when Fabs additionally bind to their cognate surface epitopes, a mechanism that ultimately targets IgG-mediated effector functions such as classical complement activation to antigenic membranes.",2020,0,0,

Fasbinder, Compend Contin Educ Dent," Advances in adhesive dentistry and technological developments using dental computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems have provided alternative esthetic restorations to conventional laboratory processed restorations. Restorative materials for CAD/CAM-generated restorations must be able to withstand the rigors of the milling process, while providing clinical longevity once cemented. The esthetic restorative materials currently available for use with the Cerec System provide dentists with ceramic and polymer options for inlays, onlays, veneers, and crowns.",2002,0,0,
173, Effect of Toothbrushing on Surface Color of Ceramic-polymer Materials: An In Vitro Study,"F. L. Pouranfar, R. Sheridan, C. Salmon and K. S. Vandewalle", J Contemp Dent Pract," AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of toothbrushing on the change in color of extrinsic characterization of ceramic-polymer materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two ceramic-polymer materials (CeraSmart, GC; Enamic, VITA) and one lithium-disilicate material (IPS e.max CAD; Ivoclar Vivadent) were tested. Specimens of each material were prepared, characterized, and glazed per manufacturer's instructions. The treated surface of the blocks were then brushed in a toothpaste slurry with artificial saliva using a toothbrush machine with a soft toothbrush. Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) L*a*b* values were recorded with a spectrophotometer at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 simulated years of brushing (7,300 strokes/year). A mean change in color (ΔE*) and standard deviation was determined for each group and brushing interval. Data were analyzed with a two-way repeated measures ANOVA examining the effects of toothbrushing the ceramic materials on ΔE* over time (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The difference in the ΔE* between CeraSmart and Enamic was significant at 3 years, while the differences between them were not significant at 6, 9, and 12 years of simulated brushing. The ΔE* of IPS e.max CAD was significantly lower than CeraSmart and Enamic at all time points (all p < 0.0001) except for the comparison with Enamic at 3 years. CONCLUSION: The extrinsic stains on the ceramic-polymer materials may be more susceptible to change from simulated toothbrushing compared to the lithium-disilicate material. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Toothbrushing may change the color of extrinsic characterization of ceramic-polymer materials. However, the change may remain clinically imperceptible to the naked eye (ΔE* > 1.0) for nearly 6 equivalent years of brushing.",2020,1,0,
26, Adhesive bonding to polymer infiltrated ceramic,"J. Schwenter, F. Schmidli, R. Weiger and J. Fischer", Dent Mater J," Aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of adhesive bonding to the polymer-infiltrated ceramic VITA Enamic [VE]. Shear bond strength was measured with three resin composite cements: RelyX Unicem 2 Automix, Clearfil SA and Variolink II on polished surfaces of VE and its components silicate ceramic [SC] and polymer [PM] (n=12). Further, the effect of etching VE with 5% HF for 15-240 s and the application of silane coupling agents was analyzed in a screening test (n=6). Shear bond strength measurements were performed after 24 h of water storage at 37°C. Significant bonding to polished substrates could only be achieved on VE and SC when silane coupling agents were used. Etching of VE with 5% HF increased shear bond strength. Following silanization of etched VE, a further increase in shear bond strength could be established. Etching for more than 30 s did not improve shear bond strength.",2016,1,0,

Voronov", Stomatologiia (Mosk)," AIM: A comparative clinical evaluation of the results of prosthetic treatment with chairside CAD/CAM crowns for molars made from hybrid ceramics VITA Enamic, blocks of feldspatic ceramics VITABlocs Mark II, blocks of leucite glass IPS Empress CAD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 30 patients aged from 19 to 60 years old with defects in hard tissues of molars. For clinical evaluation we used 'Clinical criteria for evaluation of direct and indirect restorations' developed by FDI in 2007, which included the assessment of several aesthetic, functional and biological parameters. We also included 2 additional criteria indicators: the condition of the antagonist tooth and the hygienic condition of the prosthesis in comparison with the hygiene of natural teeth. All patients were randomized into 3 groups of 10 people. After the treatment the clinical quality assessment was carried out in the following time intervals: 30 minutes, 1, 6, 12, 18, 24 months after the fixation of the crown. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation of the results of prosthetic treatment of 30 patients with chairside CAD/CAM crowns made from three different materials did not reveal any significant difference in the clinical criteria for evaluation of direct and indirect restorations within 24 months.",2019,1,0,
510, The Micromorphological Research of the Internal Structure of Chairside CAD/CAM Materials by the Method of Scanning Impulse Acoustic Microscopy (SIAM),"K. E. Goryainova, E. S. Morokov, M. V. Retinskaja, F. S. Rusanov, S. V. Apresyan and I. Y. Lebedenko", Open Dent J," AIM: The aim of the present work was to compare the elastic properties and internal structure of 4 different CAD/CAM chairside materials, by the method of Scanning Impulse Acoustic Microscopy (SIAM). METHODS: Four chairside CAD/CAM materials with different structures from hybrid ceramic (VITA Enamic, VITA Zahnfabrik), feldspatic ceramic (VITABlocs Mark II, VITA Zahnfabrik), leucite glass-ceramic (IPS Empress CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) and PMMA (Telio CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) were examined by Scanning Impulse Acoustic Microscope (SIAM). RESULTS: The results of micromorphological research of CAD/CAM chairside materials using SIAM method showed differences between the internal structures of these materials. The internal structure of feldspatic and glass-ceramic samples revealed the presence of pores with different sizes, from 10 to 100 microns; the structure of polymer materials rendered some isolated defects, while in the structure of hybrid material, defects were not found. CONCLUSION: Based on the results obtained from the present study, in cases of chairside production of dental crowns, it would be advisable to give preference to the blocks of hybrid ceramics. Such ceramics devoid of quite large porosity, glazing for CAD/CAM crowns made from leucite glass-ceramic and feldspatic ceramic may be an option. For these purposes, commercially available special muffle furnace for clinical and laboratory individualization and glazing of ceramic prostheses were provided. Further studies are needed to confirm the evidence emerging from the present research.",2018,1,0,
205, Evaluation of the Adaptation and Fracture Resistance of Three CAD-CAM Resin Ceramics: An In vitro Study,"N. Naffah, H. Ounsi, M. Ozcan, H. Bassal and Z. Salameh", J Contemp Dent Pract," AIM: The internal fit and resistance to fracture of resin ceramics are to be evaluated compared to that of lithium disilicate as the control group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of 20 crowns each (GC Cerasmart, Vita Enamic, Coltène Brilliant Crios, and e.max CAD) were cemented on identical metal dies. Marginal gaps were measured before cementation and load to fracture was applied after cementation, half of each group was thermodynamically aged (3,000 cycles of 5° to 55° immersion followed by 200,000 cycles of 100 N load), finally the crowns were loaded until fracture in a universal testing machine. Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) package 23 was used for statistical work. RESULTS: Marginal gaps ranged between 68.5 ± 23.8 µm and 87 ± 29.1 µm while occlusal gaps ranged from 220.7 ± 33.3 µm to 275.5 ± 46.5 µm and were not significantly different between groups. Fracture loads ranged from 633.8 ± 127.3 N to 1596.4 ± 497.7 N with lithium disilicate glass ceramics (LDGCs) and Enamic having higher values than resin nano-ceramics (RNCs). The fracture resistance was more related to material than aging and gap value. CONCLUSION: The margin adaptation of resin ceramics was comparable to lithium disilicate with no significant difference. Lithium disilicate showed a higher resistance than resin ceramics and there was a higher resistance to fracture for polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) than RNCs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Resin ceramics can have marginal adaptation and fracture resistance within clinical acceptance; therefore, they can be a good chair-side solution achieved in a single appointment session.",2019,1,0,
505, The fracture strength of endocrowns manufactured from different hybrid blocks under axial and lateral forces,D. H. Acar and E. Kalyoncuoğlu, Clin Oral Investig," AIM: This in vitro study was conducted to compare the fracture strength of endocrowns manufactured from different hybrid blocks under axial and lateral forces. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following root-canal treatment, 100 permanent mandibular first molars were randomly distributed among 5 groups according to restoration material. Endocrown restorations were produced from IPS e.max CAD (IPS), Vita Enamic (VE), GC Cerasmart (GC), Shofu (SH), and Brilliant Crios (BC) using CAD/CAM technology. Specimens were cemented, subjected to artificial aging, and further divided into 2 subgroups (n = 10) per group for fracture testing. Each specimen was placed on a universal testing machine and subjected to axial or lateral forces applied at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Fracture data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey, Tamhane T2, and Weibull tests. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in fracture-strength (FS) values under axial and lateral forces were observed among the groups (P < 0.05). Group BC had the highest FS value under axial forces, whereas group IPS had the highest FS value under lateral forces. According to Weibull analysis, VE exhibited the highest reliability under axial forces (7.62), whereas IPS exhibited the highest reliability under lateral forces (4.68). No statistically significant differences were detected in the distribution of failure types under either axial or lateral forces among the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: All of the hybrid blocks tested showed sufficient fracture strength for use as CAD/CAM-fabricated endocrowns. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Hybrid blocks can be used as an alternative to lithium disilicate blocks in endocrown restorations.",2021,0,0,
447, Self-etching ceramic primer versus hydrofluoric acid etching: Etching efficacy and bonding performance,H. M. El-Damanhoury and M. D. Gaintantzopoulou, J Prosthodont Res," AIM: This study assessed the effect of pretreatment of hybrid and glass ceramics using a self-etching primer on the shear bond strength (SBS) and surface topography, in comparison to pretreatment with hydrofluoric acid and silane. METHODS: 40 rectangular discs from each ceramic material (IPS e.max CAD;EM, Vita Mark II;VM, Vita Enamic;VE), were equally divided (n=10) and assigned to one of four surface pretreatment methods; etching with 4.8% hydrofluoric acid followed by Monobond plus (HFMP), Monobond etch & prime (Ivoclar Vivadent) (MEP), No treatment (NT) as negative control and Monobond plus (Ivoclar Vivadent) with no etching (MP) as positive control. SBS of resin cement (Multilink-N, Ivoclar Vivadent) to ceramic surfaces was tested following a standard protocol. Surface roughness was evaluated using an Atomic force microscope (AFM). Surface topography and elemental analysis were analyzed using SEM/EDX. Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Bonferroni test at a significance level of α=0.05. RESULTS: Pretreatment with HFMP resulted in higher SBS and increased surface roughness in comparison to MEP and MP. Regardless the method of surface pretreatment, the mean SBS values of EM ceramic was significantly higher (p<0.05) than those recorded for VM and VE, except when VE was treated with MEP, where the difference was statistically insignificant. Traces of fluoride ion were detected when MEP was used with VE and VM. CONCLUSION: Under limited conditions, using MEP resulted in comparable SBS results to HFMP; meanwhile HFMP remains the gold standard for pretreatment of glass ceramics for resin-luting cementation.",2018,1,0,
326, Influences of Light-emitting Diode Illumination Bleaching Technique on Nanohardness of Computer-aided Design and Computer-aided Manufacturing Ceramic Restorative Materials,"N. Juntavee, A. Juntavee and P. Saensutthawijit", J Contemp Dent Pract," AIM: This study evaluated the effect of light-emitting diode (LED) illumination bleaching technique on the surface nanohardness of various computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) ceramic materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty disk-shaped samples (width, length, and thickness = 10, 15, and 2 mm) were prepared from each of the ceramic materials for CAD/CAM, including Lava™ Ultimate (L(V)), Vita Enamic® (E(n)) IPS e.max® CAD (M(e)), inCoris® TZI (I(C)), and Prettau® zirconia (P(r)). The samples from each type of ceramic were randomly divided into two groups based on the different bleaching techniques to be used on them, using 35% hydrogen peroxide with and without LED illumination. The ceramic disk samples were bleached according to the manufacturer's instruction. Surface hardness test was performed before and after bleaching using nanohardness tester with a Berkovich diamond indenter. RESULTS: The respective Vickers hardness number upon no bleaching and bleaching without or with LED illumination [mean ± standard deviation (SD)] for each type of ceramic were as follows: 102.52 ± 2.09, 101.04 ± 1.18, and 98.17 ± 1.15 for L(V) groups; 274.96 ± 5.41, 271.29 ± 5.94, and 268.20 ± 7.02 for E(n) groups; 640.74 ± 31.02, 631.70 ± 22.38, and 582.32 ± 33.88 for M(e) groups; 1,442.09 ± 35.07, 1,431.32 ± 28.80, and 1,336.51 ± 34.03 for I(C) groups; and 1,383.82 ± 33.87, 1,343.51 ± 38.75, and 1,295.96 ± 31.29 for P(r) groups. The results indicated surface hardness reduction following the bleaching procedure of varying degrees for different ceramic materials. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant reduction in surface hardness due to the effect of bleaching technique, ceramic material, and the interaction between bleaching technique and ceramic material (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Bleaching resulted in a diminution of the surface hardness of dental ceramic for CAD/CAM. Using 35% hydrogen peroxide bleaching agent with LED illumination exhibited more reduction in surface hardness of dental ceramic than what was observed without LED illumination. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Clinicians should consider protection of the existing restoration while bleaching.",2018,1,0,
454, Shear bond strength of two composite resin cements to multiphase composite resin after different surface treatments and two glass-ceramics,"M. de Kuijper, M. M. M. Gresnigt, W. Kerdijk and M. S. Cune", Int J Esthet Dent," AIM: To compare the shear bond strength (SBS) after aging of two dual-curing composite resin cements to multiphase composite resin (experiment) and glass-ceramics (control). METHODS: Seventy computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) blocks were prepared: 24 multiphase composite resin blocks (Lava Ultimate; experiment), and 12 control blocks (groups 5 and 6: 6 IPS e.max CAD, 6 IPS Empress CAD). Surface treatments of the experiment groups were: 1) Al2O3 airborne particle abrasion; 2) bur-roughening; 3) silica-coated aluminum oxide particle abrasion; and 4) hydrofluoric (HF) acid etching. Per study group, Variolink II (a) and RelyX Ultimate (b) were used as cements. Per treatment group, four cement cylinders were adhered to the conditioned blocks (n = 12). After thermocyclic aging (10.000x, 5°C to 55°C), notch-edge shear testing was applied. Modes of failure were examined. A P value of 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Groups 1a (18.68 ± 3.81) and 3a (17.09 ± 3.40) performed equally to 6a (20.61 ± 4.10). Group 5a (14.39 ± 2.80) did not significantly differ from groups 1a, 3a, and 4a (15.21 ± 4.29). Group 2a (11.61 ± 3.39) showed the lowest bond strength. For the RelyX Ultimate specimens, mean bond strengths were: 1b (18.12 ± 2.84) > 4b (15.57 ± 2.31) > 2b (12.34 ± 1.72) = 3b (11.54 ± 2.45) = 6b (12.31 ± 1.87) > 5b (0.78 ± 0.89). Failure mode analysis showed a significant association between bond strength values and modes of failure (chi-square). CONCLUSION: The SBS of the composite cements to the multiphase composite resin that was treated by Al2O3 or silica-coated aluminum oxide particle abrasion is comparable to the bond of the control groups.",2019,0,1,

Ab-Ghani, W. Jaafar, S. F. Foo, Z. Ariffin and D. Mohamad", J Conserv Dent," AIM: To evaluate the shear bond strength between the dentin substrate and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing feldspathic ceramic and nano resin ceramics blocks cemented with resin cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty cuboidal blocks (5 mm × 5 mm × 5 mm) were fabricated in equal numbers from feldspathic ceramic CEREC(®) Blocs PC and nano resin ceramic Lava™ Ultimate, and randomly divided into six groups (n = 10). Each block was cemented to the dentin of 60 extracted human premolar using Variolink(®) II/Syntac Classic (multi-steps etch-and-rinse adhesive bonding), NX3 Nexus(®) (two-steps etch-and-rinse adhesive bonding) and RelyX™ U200 self-adhesive cement. All specimens were thermocycled, and shear bond strength testing was done using the universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/min. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Combination of CEREC(®) Blocs PC and Variolink(®) II showed the highest mean shear bond strength (8.71 Mpa), while the lowest of 2.06 Mpa were observed in Lava™ Ultimate and RelyX™ U200. There was no significant difference in the mean shear bond strength between different blocks. CONCLUSION: Variolink(®) II cement using multi-steps etch-and-rinse adhesive bonding provided a higher shear bond strength than the self-adhesive cement RelyX U200. The shear bond strength was not affected by the type of blocks used.",2015,1,0,
503," The evaluation of the colour changes of traditional composites, ceramic blocks and cad/cam composites in different solutions","M. Sayan, E. Bahsi and S. Sayan", Niger J Clin Pract," AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the color changes of three different traditional composites, one ceramic and two resin-based composites CAD/CAM blocks in different solutions. METHODS: The materials used in the study were CAD/CAM block containing lithium disilicate glass ceramic (Ivoclar), Vita Enamic containing resin (VITA), Lava Ultimate Block containing resin (3M ESPE), G-aenial anterior composite (GC,), Filtek™ Ultimate Universal composite (3M ESPE) and Clearfil Majesty Esthetic composite (Kuaray). As colouring solutions, red wine (Buzbaǧ), black tea (Lipton), coffee (Nescafe) and distilled water (EAU distillee) were used. For the preparation of the traditional composite samples to be used in the study, 7 × 7 mm square-shaped plexiglass moulds, 1.2 mm in thickness, were used. The CAD/CAM blocks with ceramic and resin content were cut at the same thickness using a Struers sensitive cutting device. The samples were then randomly separated into grups of 10 and of the 240 samples, groups were separated into 6 different materials and 4 different solutions. The colour measurements of the 240 samples were taken at baseline, 30 days and 120 days with a Lovibond spectrophotometer (Tintometer). RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was determined between the materials in respect of the ΔE values in the 30-day solution groups (P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was determined in the ΔE values of the different materials in the 30-day and 120-day distilled water groups (P > 0.05). A statistically significant difference was determined between the materials in respect of the ΔE values in the 120-day solution groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In respect of discolouration, ceramic blocks are more successful. Resin-based blocks and traditional aesthetic composites showed more discolouration. The dietary habits of the patient should be taken into consideration in the selection of the restorative material.",2020,0,1,
469, Structural Integrity Evaluation of Large MOD Restorations Fabricated With a Bulk-Fill and a CAD/CAM Resin Composite Material,"C. Papadopoulos, D. Dionysopoulos, K. Tolidis, P. Kouros, E. Koliniotou-Koumpia and E. A. Tsitrou", Oper Dent," AIMS: To evaluate the effect of two composite restorative techniques (direct bulk fill vs indirect CAD/CAM) on the fracture resistance and mode of fracture of extended mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) cavity preparations. METHODS: Fifty-one sound human mandibular third molars were divided into three groups (n=17). Extended bucco-lingual MOD cavities were prepared. Teeth in group 1 were restored with a bulk-fill resin composite (Filtek Bulk-Fill Posterior Restorative), teeth in group 2 were restored with composite computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) inlays (Lava Ultimate), and teeth in group 3 served as control and remained intact. All specimens were submitted to thermocycling, and a fracture resistance test was performed using a Universal testing machine (0.5 mm/min). Mode of fracture was classified into five types. One-way analysis of variance and the Duncan test were used to analyze the fracture load data at a significance level of α = 0.05. A chi-square test was used for the analysis of fracture mode between the restorative groups. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed significant differences in fracture resistance among the experimental groups. The teeth restored with the bulk-fill composite exhibited lower fracture resistance (1285.3±655.0 N) when compared to the teeth restored with the composite CAD/CAM inlays (1869.8±529.4 N) (p<0.05). Mode of fracture showed the same distribution between the restorative groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although both types of restorations failed at loads larger than those found in the oral cavity, the CAD/CAM composite inlays increased the fracture resistance of teeth with large MOD cavities when compared to direct bulk-fill composite restorations. The majority of fracture types were intraorally repairable for both restorative techniques.",2019,0,1,

Castelo-Baz, R. Agustín-Panadero and J. L. Román-Rodriguez", Medicina (Kaunas)," Background and Objectives: To evaluate in vitro the fracture resistance and fracture type of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials. Materials and Methods: Discs were fabricated (10 × 1.5 mm) from four test groups (N = 80; N = 20 per group): lithium disilicate (LDS) group (control group): IPS e.max CAD(®); zirconium-reinforced lithium silicate (ZRLS) group: VITA SUPRINITY(®); polymer-infiltrated ceramic networks (PICN) group: VITA ENAMIC(®); resin nanoceramics (RNC) group: LAVA™ ULTIMATE. Each disc was cemented (following the manufacturers' instructions) onto previously prepared molar dentin. Samples underwent until fracture using a Shimadzu(®) test machine. The stress suffered by each material was calculated with the Hertzian model, and its behavior was analyzed using the Weibull modulus. Data were analyzed with ANOVA parametric statistical tests. Results: The LDS group obtained higher fracture resistance (4588.6 MPa), followed by the ZRLS group (4476.3 MPa) and PICN group (4014.2 MPa) without statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Hybrid materials presented lower strength than ceramic materials, the RNC group obtaining the lowest values (3110 MPa) with significant difference (p < 0.001). Groups PICN and RNC showed greater occlusal wear on the restoration surface prior to star-shaped fracture on the surface, while other materials presented radial fracture patterns.

121, Effect of biomimetic material on stress distribution in mandibular molars restored with inlays: a three-dimensional finite element analysis,"J. Zhu, D. Luo, Q. Rong and X. Wang", PeerJ," BACKGROUND: Although biomimetic material has become increasingly popular in dental cosmetology nowadays, it remains unclear how it would affect the restored teeth during chewing. It is necessary to study the influence of biomimetic material on stress distribution in the restored teeth. METHODS: Eight three-dimensional finite element (FE) models were constructed and divided into two groups. Group 1 included the FE model of intact molar, and the FE models of inlay-restored molars fabricated from IPS e.max CAD, Lava Ultimate and biomimetic materials individually. Enamel was considered a homogeneous material. Group 2 included the FE models of intact molar and molars restored with inlays using IPS e.max CAD, Lava Ultimate and biomimetic materials individually, considering enamel as an inhomogeneous material. RESULTS: In Group 1, compared with that in the intact molar, the maximum tensile stress (MTS) in the occlusal grooves decreased in the inlay-restored molars fabricated from IPS e.max CAD and was concentrated on the cavity floor at the buccal side in the inner dentin around inlay. When Lava Ultimate was selected, MTS decreased in the occlusal grooves and on the cavity floor but increased in the lateral walls. In the restored molar using biomimetic material, the MTS on the cavity floor was distributed more evenly than that in the molar using IPS e.max CAD, and no obvious changes were noted in the lateral walls. The same changes were observed in Group 2. No differences in the stress distribution pattern were noted among the FE models in Groups 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: Molars restored with inlays fabricated from biomimetic material exhibit a more uniform stress distribution in the dentin around restoration. The consideration of enamel as a homogeneous tissue is acceptable for analyzing the maximum principal stress distribution in the inlay-restored molar.",2019,0,0,

The authors investigated this possibility by comparing the fracture resistance of molars restored with direct techniques with that of molars restored with indirect techniques. METHODS: The authors divided 50 extracted sound third molars into 5 groups: sound teeth, onlay (ON), inlay (IN), direct CR, and transfixed fiberglass post (TFP) plus direct CR. The authors performed standardized mesio-occlusodistal cavity preparations and endodontic treatments. The authors cemented indirect restorations of Lava Ultimate (3M ESPE) adhesively in the ON and IN groups. The authors restored CR group teeth directly with Filtek Z230 XT (3M ESPE). In the TFP group, the authors transfixed 2 fiberglass posts horizontally and restored the teeth directly with CR. Thereafter, the authors submitted the teeth to cyclic fatigue loading with 500,000 cycles at 200 newtons. The authors tested fracture resistance in newtons in a universal testing machine. The authors analyzed data with 1-way analysis of variance and a Tukey test (P < .05). RESULTS: Sound teeth had the highest fracture resistance. ON had the highest recovery of resistance, followed by TFP. CR had the lowest recovery, which was similar to that of IN. CONCLUSIONS: Endodontically treated molars restored with TFP plus CR had fracture resistance similar to those restored with ON, which was higher than that for IN or CR only. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Horizontal TFPs placed inside a composite restoration had the same performance as did ON restorations.",2016,0,0,
39, Biomechanical properties of polymer-infiltrated ceramic crowns on one-piece zirconia implants after long-term chewing simulation,"P. Baumgart, H. Kirsten, R. Haak and C. Olms", Int J Implant Dent," BACKGROUND: Implant and superstructure provide a complex system, which has to withstand oral conditions. Concerning the brittleness of many ceramics, fractures are a greatly feared issue. Therefore, polymer-infiltrated ceramic networks (PICNs) were developed. Because of its low Young's modulus and high elastic modulus, the PICN crown on a one-piece zirconia implant might absorb forces to prevent the system from fracturing in order to sustain oral forces. Recommendations for the material of superstructure on zirconia implants are lacking, and only one study investigates PICN crowns on these types of implants. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine PICN crowns on one-piece zirconia implants regarding bond strength and surface wear after long-term chewing simulation (CS). METHODS: Twenty-five hybrid ceramic crowns (Vita Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik) were produced using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology and adhesively bonded (RelyX™ Ultimate, 3M ESPE) to zirconia implants. Twenty of the specimens underwent simultaneous mechanical loading and thermocycling simulating a 5-year clinical situation (SD Mechatronik GmbH). Wear depth and wear volume, based on X-ray micro-computed tomography volume scans (Skyscan 1172-100-50, Bruker) before and after CS, were evaluated. All crowns were removed from the implants using a universal testing machine (Z010, Zwick GmbH&Co.KG). Subsequently, luting agent was light microscopically localized (Stemi 2000-C, Zeiss). With a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Phenom™ G2 pro, Phenom World), the area of abrasion was assessed. RESULTS: 1. After CS, none of the tested crowns were fractured or loosened. 2. The maximum vertical wear after CS was M = 0.31 ± 0.04 mm (mean ± standard deviation), and the surface wear was M = 0.74 ± 0.23 mm(3). 3. The pull-off tests revealed a 1.8 times higher bond strength of the control group compared to the experimental group (t(23) = 8.69, p < 0.001). 4. Luting agent was mostly located in the crowns, not on the implants. 5. The area of abrasion showed avulsion and a rough surface. CONCLUSIONS: PICN on one-piece zirconia implants showed high bond strength and high wear after CS.",2018,1,0,
470, Surface Characteristics and Biofilm Development on Selected Dental Ceramic Materials,"K. H. Kim, C. Loch, J. N. Waddell, G. Tompkins and D. Schwass", Int J Dent," BACKGROUND: Intraoral adjustment and polishing of dental ceramics often affect their surface characteristics, promoting increased roughness and consequent biofilm growth. This study correlated surface roughness to biofilm development with four commercially available ceramic materials. METHODS: Four ceramic materials (Vita Enamic®, Lava™ Ultimate, Vitablocs Mark II, and Wieland Reflex®) were prepared as per manufacturer instructions. Seventeen specimens of each material were adjusted and polished to simulate clinical intraoral procedures and another seventeen remained unaltered. Specimens were analysed by SEM imaging, confocal microscopy, and crystal violet assay. RESULTS: SEM images showed more irregular surface topography in adjusted specimens than their respective controls. Surface roughness (R(a) ) values were greater in all materials following adjustments. All adjusted materials with the exception of Vitablocs Mark II promoted significantly greater biofilm growth relative to controls. CONCLUSION: Simulated intraoral polishing methods resulted in greater surface roughness and increased biofilm accumulation.",2017,1,0,
18, A comparison of the marginal adaptation of composite overlays fabricated with silicone and an intraoral scanner,"C. García-Cuesta, V. Faus-Llácer, Á. Zubizarreta-Macho, R. Botello-Torres and V. Faus-Matoses", J Clin Exp Dent," BACKGROUND: Intraoral scanners have been developing during last years. The aim of this study was to know if digital impressions achieve a marginal adaptation in overlays as well as conventional impressions with silicone. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-two extracted molars were selected. The samples were prepared for MOD overlays. The teeth were divided into two groups (n=31). Group 1: impressions were made with silicone (Express™ Impression, 3M ESPE) and overlays were manufactured with Sinfony composite (3M ESPE) by the laboratory technician. Group 2: impressions were taken with the scanner True Definition (TD, 3M ESPE) and under Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM Restorative composite (3M ESPE) were produced the restorations. Under 32x magnification images of vestibular, lingual, mesial and distal were capture in all the samples. Then the fit of the restorations was evaluated before and after cementation. Data were analysed statistically applying ANOVA and Bonferroni test. RESULTS: The marginal gap was better in TD group before (169,76 ± 54,15 µm) and after (145,16 ± 57,89 µm) cementation than in the silicone group (190,89 ± 58,18 µm) (187,47 ± 81,29 µm). The lowest marginal gap was in oclusal surface and the higher value was in the proximal margin for all the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Digital impressions regarding marginal adaptation achieve better results than conventional impressions.

71, Clinical Bonding of Resin Nano Ceramic Restorations to Zirconia Abutments: A Case Series within a Randomized Clinical Trial,"U. Schepke, H. J. Meijer, K. M. Vermeulen, G. M. Raghoebar and M. S. Cune", Clin Implant Dent Relat Res," BACKGROUND: New dental materials are introduced and promoted in the field without extensive clinical testing. Using those materials in a clinical setting might result in unacceptable early failure rates. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper was to analyze bonding of a new dental restorative material to either zirconia stock abutments or zirconia customized abutments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty participants seeking single implant treatment were included in a prospective study. Resin Nano Ceramic (RNC, Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) crowns were digitally manufactured and extraorally bonded to either a stock or a customized zirconia abutment (ZirDesign and ATLANTIS, DENTSPLY Implants, Mölndal, Sweden) by means of a resin composite cement (RelyX Ultimate in combination with Scotchbond Universal, 3M ESPE), strictly following the manufacturer's recommendations. The final restorations were screw-retained to the implants and followed during 12 months. Primary outcome parameter was uncompromised survival of the restoration, and secondary outcome parameter was mode of failure. RESULTS: No implants were lost. The uncompromised survival rate of the RNC crowns bonded to zirconia abutments after 1 year of clinical service was only 14% (n = 7). Catastrophic failure occurred in three cases (6%), whereas bonding failure between RNC crowns and zirconia abutments occurred in 80% of the cases (n = 40) within the first year of service. No statistical significant difference in uncompromised survival rate could be identified between abutment types (χ(2)  = 1.495, p = .209). Uncompromised survival rate after 1 year was highly significantly different (χ(2)  = 104.173, p < .001) from a reference standard, which was set at 95%. CONCLUSION: RNC crowns luted to stock and customized zirconia implant abutments with the particular resin composite cement in this trial have a poor prognosis, regardless of the abutment type used.",2016,1,0,
198, Evaluation of five CAD/CAM materials by microstructural characterization and mechanical tests: a comparative in vitro study,"N. Sonmez, P. Gultekin, V. Turp, G. Akgungor, D. Sen and E. Mijiritsky", BMC Oral Health," BACKGROUND: Polymer infiltrated ceramics and nano-ceramic resins are the new restorative materials which have been developed in order to enhance the adverse properties of glass-matrix ceramics and resin composites. The aim of the present in vitro study was to evaluate the characteristics of various CAD/CAM materials through mechanical, microstructural, and SEM analysis. METHODS: Five test groups (n = 22) were formed by using the indicated CAD/CAM blocks: VITA Enamic (VITA Zahnfabrik), Lava Ultimate (3 M ESPE), IPS e.max CAD (Ivoclar Vivadent), IPS Empress CAD (Ivoclar Vivadent), and VITA Mark II (VITA Zahnfabrik). Two specimens from each test group were used for XRD and EDS analysis. Remaining samples were divided into two subgroups (n = 10). One subgroup specimens were thermocycled (5 °C to 55 °C, 30s, 10,000 cycles) whereas the other were not. All of the specimens were evaluated in terms of flexural strength, Vickers hardness, and fracture toughness. Results were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's HSD, and Student's t tests (α = .05). Fractured specimens were evaluated using SEM. RESULTS: The highest Vickers microhardness value was found for VITA Mark II (p < .001), however flexural strength and fracture toughness results were lowest conversely (p < .05). IPS e.max CAD was found to have the highest flexural strength (p < .001). Fracture toughness of IPS e.max CAD was also higher than other tested block materials (p < .001). Lava Ultimate and VITA Enamic's mechanical properties were affected negatively from thermocycling (p < .05). Microhardness, flexural strength, and fracture toughness values of Lava Ultimate and VITA Enamic were found to be similar to VITA Mark II and IPS Empress CAD groups. CONCLUSIONS: It should be realised that simulated aging process seem to affect ceramic-polymer composite materials more significantly than glass ceramics.",2018,1,1,
407," Peri-implant biomechanical responses to standard, short-wide, and double mini implants replacing missing molar supporting hybrid ceramic or full-metal crowns under axial and off-axial loading: an in vitro study","L. S. Elfadaly, L. S. Khairallah and M. A. Al Agroudy", Int J Implant Dent," BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical response of the peri-implant bone to standard, short-wide, and double mini implants replacing missing molar supporting either hybrid ceramic crowns (Lava Ultimate restorative) or full-metal crowns under two different loading conditions (axial and off-axial loading) using strain gauge analysis. METHODS: Three single-molar implant designs, (1) single, 3.8-mm (regular) diameter implant, (2) single, 5.8-mm (wide) diameter implant, and (3) two 2.5-mm diameter (double) implants connected through a single-molar crown, were embedded in epoxy resin by the aid of a surveyor to ensure their parallelism. Each implant supported full-metal crowns made of Ni-Cr alloy and hybrid ceramic with standardized dimensions. Epoxy resin casts were prepared to receive 4 strain gauges around each implant design, on the buccal, lingual, mesial, and distal surfaces. Results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Results showed that implant design has statistically significant effect on peri-implant microstrains, where the standard implant showed the highest mean microstrain values followed by double mini implants, while the short-wide implant showed the lowest mean microstrain values. Concerning the superstructure material, implants supporting Lava Ultimate crowns had statistically significant higher mean microstrain values than those supporting full-metal crowns. Concerning the load direction, off-axial loading caused uneven distribution of load with statistically significant higher microstrain values on the site of off-axial loading (distal surface) than the axial loading. CONCLUSIONS: Implant design, superstructure material, and load direction significantly affect peri-implant microstrains.",2017,1,0,
125, Effect of ceramic translucency and luting cement shade on the color masking ability of laminate veneers,"B. S. M. Kandil, A. M. Hamdy, A. K. Aboelfadl and M. I. El-Anwar", Dent Res J (Isfahan)," BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ceramic material types, degree of veneer translucency, and luting cement shades on masking the underlying dark dental substrate to achieve best esthetics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, 56 specimens each of 0.5-mm thickness were fabricated from two esthetic veneer materials Vita Enamic and Vita Suprinity, with two different translucencies, i.e., HT and T. To simulate the color of a dark underlying dental structure, background discs with C3 shade were fabricated using resin composite. The ceramic specimens with varying translucencies were cemented on the dark background of the resin composite with A1 and opaque white shades of resin luting cement. Color difference (ΔE) values from a reference color (A1 shade) were calculated using a spectrophotometer. The results were then statistically analyzed using three-way ANOVA test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The ΔE values of both ceramic systems were affected by both the degree of veneer translucency (P = 0.00) and the luting agent shade (P = 0.016). The use of an opaque luting agent and T translucency resulted in a decrease in the ΔE* values for all ceramics tested, regardless to the material type. Suprinity and Enamic showed similarity in the masking ability of dark substrate after cementation. CONCLUSION: None of the 0.5-mm veneers of the two ceramic systems could reach A1 shade without a detectable color difference after cementation. The change in degree of veneer translucency was more effective than the change in luting agent shade in masking the underlying dark substrate.",2019,1,0,
176, Effect of universal adhesives on microtensile bond strength to hybrid ceramic,"M. M. Awad, L. Albedaiwi, A. Almahdy, R. Khan, N. Silikas, M. M. Hatamleh, F. M. Alkhtani and A. Alrahlah", BMC Oral Health," BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of universal adhesives (UA) and silane on the microtensile bond strength (μTBS) of resin cement to a hybrid ceramic Vita Enamic (VE). METHODS: VE specimens were acid etched using hydrofluoric acid (HF) and were assigned to three groups (n = 10) based on the applied bonding technique. In group 1 (S), a silane-based primer was used as a surface treatment prior to the application of a resin cement (Variolink Esthetic DC). In group 2, a silane-containing UA, Clearfil Universal Bond (CUB) was used for the surface treatment, and in group 3, A silane-free UA, Tetric N-Bond Universal (TNU) was used for surface treatment. Resin cement build-ups were prepared. The bonded specimens were sectioned into resin-ceramic beams. Half of the beams of each group were stored for 24 h at 37 °C and the other half were subjected to a thermo-cycling aging. The microtensile bond strength (μTBS) was measured at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Failure modes were assessed accordingly. Data were analyzed using a) two-way analysis of variance ANOVA followed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests between groups and b) independent t-test to detect differences (α = 0.05) for each group. The surface topographies of the ceramic surface were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The results showed that silane-based primer (S) application resulted in significantly higher (p < 0.05) μTBS values after 24 h and after thermocycling compared to both silane-containing UA (CUB) and silane-free UA (TNU). The μTBS values of all groups were significantly reduced after thermocycling. No statistically significant difference was observed between the μTBS of CUB and TNU after 24 h. However, TNU showed significantly higher μTBS after thermocycling. Different failure modes were observed, and adhesive failure was the most common in all groups. Marked surface topographic changes were observed following HF etching. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that, the UAs tested cannot be recommended as substitutes to the silanization of Hybrid ceramic.",2019,1,0,
69, Chemical degradation of dental CAD/CAM materials,O. Sagsoz and N. Polat Sagsoz, Biomed Mater Eng," BACKGROUND: The chemical properties of the oral environment have an appreciable influence on the in vivo degradation of CAD/CAM materials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of organic acids, heptane and ethanol (the food-simulating liquids) on CAD/CAM restorative materials. METHODS: Four CAD/CAM materials were selected: (1) 3M ESPE LAVA Ultimate, (2) VITA Enamic, (3) IPS e.max CAD, (4) VITA Suprinity. Seven different samples were fabricated in 15 × 4 × 1.2 mm dimensions from each material (n = 7, N = 140). The materials were conditioned for 7 days at 37 °C as follows: artificial saliva, 75% ethanol, heptane, 0.02 N citric acid, 0.02 N lactic acid in aqueous solution and were tested to obtain flexural strength, surface micro-hardness and wear characteristics. After conditioning, the flexural strength values were assessed using a universal testing machine (1 mm/min crosshead speed) and the fractured samples were used for determination of Vickers hardness values using a digital micro-hardness tester (100 g/10 s) and determination of wear using a chewing simulator. Two factor analysis of variance with interaction model and Tukey's post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The highest mechanical property values were found for IPS e.max and VITA Suprinity and the lowest values were found for LAVA Ultimate. Organic acids negatively affected the mechanical properties of e.max CAD and Suprinity. Ethanol and heptane were more effective on LAVA Ultimate and Enamic. There were significant differences among groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The mechanical properties of CAD/CAM restorative materials are influenced by food-simulating liquids.",2019,0,0,
94, Comparison the degree of enamel wear behavior opposed to Polymer-infiltrated ceramic and feldspathic porcelain,"A. H. Ashtiani, M. Azizian and A. Rohani", Dent Res J (Isfahan)," BACKGROUND: The degree of tooth enamel wear is an important aspect of the clinical acceptability of all-ceramic restorations. The purpose of this study was to compare the degree of enamel wear by feldspathic porcelain and polymer-infiltrated ceramic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, 10 polymer-infiltrated ceramics were prepared by creating the sections of Vita Enamic(®) blocks (18 mm × 14 mm × 4 mm). A total of 10 porcelain cylinders were built, and feldspathic porcelain (VMK 95, Vita) was used and fired over the metal discs. A total of 20 human maxillary premolars were assigned as antagonist. Then, 10 teeth were arranged and placed oppose to porcelain samples and 10 others were placed oppose to polymer-infiltrated-ceramic specimens in the chewing simulator. The samples were photographed before and after the chewing simulation. The difference between the two photograph was measured by stereomicroscope and Motic Image plus software 2.0 three times, and then, the mean of these three times was recorded as the amount of wear. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-test and SPSS version 16. The level of significancy was 0.05. RESULTS: The mean wear rate teeth oppose to the feldspathic porcelain group (377.294 μ) was significantly higher than that of the polymer-infiltrated ceramic group (101.755 μ) (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: In the present study, the amount of enamel wear of the natural teeth opposed to polymer-infiltrated ceramic was significantly lower than feldspathic porcelain.",2019,1,0,
450, Shade Stability of Polymer-Infiltrated and Resin Nano Ceramics,M. G. Schürmann and C. Olms, Open Dent J," BACKGROUND: The esthetics plays an increasingly significant role in today's dentistry. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the shade stability of a polymer-infiltrated and a resin nano ceramic in comparison to a conventional feldspar ceramic and an acrylate polymer. METHODS: 20 specimens of each of the materials, CAD-Temp (CT), Mark II (M), VITA Enamic (VE) and Lava Ultimate (LU), were prepared using the standard method. These were divided into groups (n=5) and placed in the following stain solutions: Distilled water, coffee, Coca-Cola and red wine for 14 days. The shade of each specimen was measured before and after using a spectrophotometer (n=5). The data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: The largest ΔE mean values were observed in CT by Coca-Cola (4.38 ± 0.41), in M by coffee (5.95 ± 0.62), in VE (6.02 ± 0.78) and LU (8.61 ± 0.30) by red wine. LU had the largest and strongest overall shade differences (total score: SSC=16.95) and CT the least (SSC=8.74). Overall shade differences of VE (SSC=12.03) and M (SSC=12.48) were statistically indistinguishable. After 14 days, only Coca-Cola caused clinically relevant shade differences in CT (ΔE > 2.7); this was also caused by coffee, Coca-Cola and red wine in M and coffee and red wine in VE and LU. CONCLUSION: On average, VE showed fewer shade differences than LU. After 14 days of immersion, shade differences which exceeded the clinical acceptance threshold of ΔE=2.7 were shown by CT in Coca-Cola, by M in coffee, Coca-Cola and red wine, and by VE and LU in coffee and red wine.",2018,1,0,
83, Comparative characterization of a novel cad-cam polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network,"A. Albero, A. Pascual, I. Camps and M. Grau-Benitez", J Clin Exp Dent," BACKGROUND: The field of dental ceramics for CAD-CAM is enriched with a new innovative material composition having a porous three-dimensional structure of feldspathic ceramic infiltrated with acrylic resins.The aim of this study is to determine the mechanical properties of Polymer-Infiltrated-Ceramic-Network (PICN) and compare its performance with other ceramics and a nano-ceramic resin available for CAD-CAM systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study a total of five different materials for CAD-CAM were investigated. A polymer-infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic), a nano-ceramic resin (Lava Ultimate), a feldspathic ceramic (Mark II), a lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS-e max CAD) and finally a Leucite based ceramic (Empress - CAD). From CAD-CAM blocks, 120 bars (30 for each material cited above) were cut to measure the flexural strength with a three-point-bending test. Strain at failure, fracture stress and Weibull modulus was calculated. Vickers hardness of each material was also measured. RESULTS: IPS-EMAX presents mechanical properties significantly better from the other materials studied. Its strain at failure, flexural strength and hardness exhibited significantly higher values in comparison with the others. VITA ENAMIC and LAVA ULTIMATE stand out as the next most resistant materials. CONCLUSIONS: The flexural strength, elastic modulus similar to a tooth as well as having less hardness than ceramics make PICN materials an option to consider as a restorative material.

124, Effect of cavity design and material type on fracture resistance and failure pattern of molars restored by computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing inlays/onlays,"R. M. Alassar, A. M. Samy and F. M. Abdel-Rahman", Dent Res J (Isfahan)," BACKGROUND: The maximum conservation of tooth structure and the use of restorative materials with elastic modulus close to the dental structure may promote greater longevity of the tooth/restoration complex. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of cavity design and material type on fracture resistance and failure pattern of molars restored by computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) inlays/onlays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, 55 human maxillary molars were embedded in resin blocks and divided into control group (CG) and five main groups: Group 1: Inlay, Group 2: Conventional onlay/mesiobuccal (MB), Group 3: Conservative onlay/MB, Group 4: Conventional onlay/MB and distobuccal (DB), and Group 5: Conservative onlay/MB and DB. Then, each group was divided into two subgroups: (A) CeraSmart (CS) and (B) Katana Zirconia (KZ). Restorations were cemented by RelyX Ultimate and then thermocycled. The universal testing machine was used to measure fracture loads. Failure was determined using a magnifying lens. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Group 5 showed the highest significant fracture load, whereas the least significant value was recorded in Group 2. KZ recorded higher significant fracture loads than CS in all tested groups. Groups 1, 2, and 3 restored by CS showed lower fracture load than CG, but the difference was insignificant with Group 1. CS restorations showed restorable failure, while unrestorable pattern was predominant in KZ restorations (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: KZ inlays and onlays can be used safely in terms of fracture resistance as both have values exceed the physiologic requirements. CS inlays and onlays/MB and DB are of fracture resistance comparable to intact teeth. The use of conservative onlay design with more cusp coverage guarantees better resistance of CS restorations. Being force absorbing material, the predominant failure of teeth restored by CS was restorable.",2021,0,0,
101, Deep sequencing of biofilm microbiomes on dental composite materials,"G. Conrads, L. K. Wendt, F. Hetrodt, Z. L. Deng, D. Pieper, M. M. H. Abdelbary, A. Barg, I. Wagner-Döbler and C. Apel", J Oral Microbiol," Background: The microbiome on dental composites has not been studied in detail before. It has not been conclusively clarified whether restorative materials influence the oral microbiome. Methods: We used Illumina Miseq next-generation sequencing of the 16S V1-V2 region to compare the colonisation patterns of bovine enamel (BE) and the composite materials Grandio Flow (GF) and Grandio Blocs (GB) after 48 h in vivo in 14 volunteers. Applying a new method to maintain the oral microbiome ex vivo for 48 h also, we compared the microbiome on GF alone and with the new antimicrobial substance carolacton (GF+C). Results: All in vitro biofilm communities showed a higher diversity and richness than those grown in vivo but the very different atmospheric conditions must be considered. Contrary to expectations, there were only a few significant differences between BE and the composite materials GB and GF either in vivo or in vitro: Oribacterium, Peptostreptococcaceae [XI][G-1] and Streptococcus mutans were more prevalent and Megasphaera, Prevotella oulorum, Veillonella atypica, V. parvula, Gemella morbillorum, and Fusobacterium periodonticum were less prevalent on BE than on composites. In vivo, such preferences were only significant for Granulicatella adiacens (more prevalent on BE) and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. animalis (more prevalent on composites). On DNA sequence level, there were no significant differences between the biofilm communities on GF and GF+C. Conclusion: We found that the oral microbiome showed an increased richness when grown on various composites compared to BE in vitro, but otherwise changed only slightly independent of the in vivo or in vitro condition. Our new ex vivo biofilm model might be useful for pre-clinical testing of preventive strategies.",2019,0,1,
298, Influence of different luting protocols on shear bond strength of computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing resin nanoceramic material to dentin,"C. Poggio, M. Pigozzo, M. Ceci, A. Scribante, R. Beltrami and M. Chiesa", Dent Res J (Isfahan)," BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of three different luting protocols on shear bond strength of computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) resin nanoceramic (RNC) material to dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, 30 disks were milled from RNC blocks (Lava Ultimate/3M ESPE) with CAD/CAM technology. The disks were subsequently cemented to the exposed dentin of 30 recently extracted bovine permanent mandibular incisors. The specimens were randomly assigned into 3 groups of 10 teeth each. In Group 1, disks were cemented using a total-etch protocol (Scotchbond™ Universal Etchant phosphoric acid + Scotchbond Universal Adhesive + RelyX™ Ultimate conventional resin cement); in Group 2, disks were cemented using a self-etch protocol (Scotchbond Universal Adhesive + RelyX™ Ultimate conventional resin cement); in Group 3, disks were cemented using a self-adhesive protocol (RelyX™ Unicem 2 Automix self-adhesive resin cement). All cemented specimens were placed in a universal testing machine (Instron Universal Testing Machine 3343) and submitted to a shear bond strength test to check the strength of adhesion between the two substrates, dentin, and RNC disks. Specimens were stressed at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey's test at a level of significance of 0.05. RESULTS: Post-hoc Tukey testing showed that the highest shear strength values (P < 0.001) were reported in Group 2. The lowest data (P < 0.001) were recorded in Group 3. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this in vitro study, conventional resin cements (coupled with etch and rinse or self-etch adhesives) showed better shear strength values compared to self-adhesive resin cements. Furthermore, conventional resin cements used together with a self-etch adhesive reported the highest values of adhesion.",2016,1,0,

Hayran", BMC Oral Health," BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of staining solutions and surface finishing on the colour stability and translucency of hybrid ceramic (HC) and resin nanoceramic (RNC) materials. METHODS: Twenty four groups consisting of 10 specimens (240 specimens in total) were created out of HC and RNC, including six groups to be stored in distilled water served as the controls groups. The Vita Enamic technical set, Shofu polishers, medium and fine rubber wheels and Sof-Lex polishing discs were used as polishing instruments. Cola, tea, and coffee were used as staining solutions. The colour differences (∆E*) and translucency parameter (TP) were evaluated by a spectrophotometer. Data were analysed by a One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the ∆E* values of the HC specimens in the coffee groups and the ∆E* values of the other HC groups (p < 0.05). The ∆E* values of the RNC specimens in the coffee and tea groups were not different from the specimens in the cola groups (p > 0.05). The TP values of the polished groups were higher than the Sof-Lex groups and the Shofu groups on both HC and RNC materials (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Increased ∆E* values were observed in HC specimens stored in a coffee solution compared to the specimens stored in a tea or cola solution. Both of the RNC specimens stored in coffee and tea had higher ∆E* values than the RNC specimens stored in the cola. The TP values of both HC and RNC specimens stored in the coffee solution decreased.",2018,1,0,

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of hydrofluoric acid concentration and etching time on the shear bond strength (SBS) of two adhesive and two self-adhesive resin composite cements to different CAD/CAM ceramic materials. METHODS: SBS of two adhesive (Panavia V5, Kuraray, [PV5]; Vita Adiva F-Cem, Vita Zahnfabrik, [VAF]) and two self-adhesive (RelyX Unicem 2 Automix, 3 M Espe, [RUN]; Vita Adiva S-Cem, Vita, [VAS]) cements to four different CAD/CAM materials (Vitablocs Mark II, Vita, [VM]; Vita Enamic, Vita, [VE]; e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent, [EC]; Vita Suprinity PC, Vita, [VS]) was measured. The effect of the surface pretreatment by using two different hydrofluoric acid products (HF5% Vita Ceramics Etch, Vita and HF9% buffered, Ultradent Porcelain Etch, Ultradent Products) were assessed at etching times of 0 s, 5 s, 15 s, 30s and 60s for each cement and restorative material combination (n = 10 per group, total n = 1440). RESULTS: Significant effects were found for the etching time and cement for all materials with highest shear bond strength for etching times of 60s = 30s = 15 s ≥ 5 s > 0 s and for RUN>PV5 = VAF > VAS (p < 0.05). Etching with HF5% for 5 s to 15 s resulted in higher SBS values, while no differences were observed between HF5% and HF9% buffered when the substrates were etched for 30s to 60s (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study the recommended surface pretreatment of silicate ceramics is HF etching with concentrations of 5% or 9% for 15 s to 60s to achieve highest shear bond strength while the glassy matrix is sufficiently dissolved. The tested resin composite cements can be applied with all tested materials and suggested for clinical application.",2019,1,0,
76, Color and translucency stability of novel restorative CAD/CAM materials,"E. Eldwakhly, D. R. M. Ahmed, M. Soliman, M. M. Abbas and W. Badrawy", Dent Med Probl," BACKGROUND: The wide range of restorative materials available for use in the computer-aided design/ computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology requires a better understanding of their esthetic properties. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the stability of the color and translucency of different CAD/ CAM restorative materials before and after being subjected to different staining solutions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 160 disc-shaped specimens were prepared from glass ceramic (IPS-e.max®-CAD and Celtra Duo®), high-translucency zirconia (LavaTM Plus), resin nanoceramic (LavaTM Ultimate), and hybrid ceramic (VITA ENAMIC®) CAD/CAM blocks (5 groups, n = 32). The specimen color and translucency parameter (TP) were assessed using a spectrophotometer at baseline and after subjecting the specimens to different staining solutions (coffee, cola, ginger, and water). Changes in color (ΔE) and TP (ΔTP) were calculated. The data was analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc test (p < 0.05). The correlation between ΔE and ΔTP was investigated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Staining significantly affected the baseline color of all specimens. Ginger had the most significant effect on Lava Plus (ΔE = 4.01 ±1.2), cola on Celtra Duo (ΔE = 2.29 ±0.25) and coffee on Lava Ultimate (ΔE = 2.59 ±0.17). Generally, IPS-e.max-CAD showed the smallest ΔE. No significant differences in ΔTP were found between different staining solutions. Increased ΔE correlated with decreased translucency for all the tested materials and staining solutions. CONCLUSIONS: Staining had a marked effect on the color and translucency of the tested CAD/CAM materials. The color change was staining solutionand material-dependent, with IPS-e.max-CAD showing the greatest color stability.",2019,1,0,
168, Effect of surface treatments to remove temporary cement remnants on the bond strength between the core composite and resin cement,"S. H. Altintas, K. Hamiyet and S. Kilic", Niger J Clin Pract," BACKGROUND: There was no enough data about the appropriate surface cleaning of core composite material after temporary cementation. AIM: To evaluate the effects of surface cleaning techniques on initial shear bond strength (SBS) between core composite material and resin nanoceramic crown materials after temporary cementation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cubic specimens were prepared from prosthetic materials, including Lava Ultimate. Cylinder-shaped composites were cemented to glass slides with eugenol-free temporary cement, resulting in a total of 44 cylinders (n = 11). The surfaces of composite cylinders were then cleaned with an Er, Cr:YSGG laser, 37% orthophosphoric acid, yellow tape diamond bur, or dental explorer. Cleaned cylinders were bonded to cubic specimens with resin cement. Initial SBS tests were performed with a universal testing machine at 0.5 mm/min crosshead speed. One-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests were used to analyze the obtained data (P =0.05). RESULTS: Initial SBS values were significantly affected by the different surface cleaning methods (P <.05). The highest SBS value was obtained with the laser group (SBS = 17.14), while the lowest was obtained with dental explorer group (SBS = 5.95). There was no significant difference between the diamond bur group and the laser group (P =0.982). CONCLUSIONS: Laser irradiation or yellow tape diamond bur cleaning of the core composite surface could be recommended to strengthen bond strength between the resin luting cement and the core composite. Before adhesive or conventional cementation of prosthetic restoration, the core composite surface should be cleaned.",2019,1,0,
272, Impact of storage media and temperature on color stability of tooth-colored CAD/CAM materials for final restorations,"A. Liebermann, D. Vehling, M. Eichberger and B. Stawarczyk", J Appl Biomater Funct Mater," BACKGROUND: This in-vitro study examined the impact of storage solution, storage duration, and storage temperature on discoloration of three tooth-colored CAD/CAM materials for final restorations. METHODS: Specimens (N = 288; n = 96 per material) with a thickness of 1 ± 0.03 mm of the following CAD/CAM materials were fabricated: resin composite (Lava Ultimate, 3M), polymer-infiltrated ceramic (VITA Enamic, VITA Zahnfabrik), and leucite ceramic (IPS Empress CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent). After baseline measurement, specimens were stored in red wine, curry solution, cress solution, and distilled water at 37°C or 55°C. The discoloration was measured using a spectrophotometer (Lambda 35 Perkin Elmer, Perkin Elmer Inc.) after 1 and 7 days storage. Data were analyzed using four-way ANOVA followed by the Scheffé post-hoc test and partial eta squared (η(P)²) test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The highest influence on ∆E was exerted by storage duration (η(P)² = 0.295, p < 0.001), followed by storage solution (η(P)² = 0.171, p < 0.001), CAD/CAM material (η(P)² = 0.049, p < 0.001), and storage temperature (η(P)² = 0.033, p < 0.001). Specimens stored for 7 days in staining solutions showed more discoloration than those stored for just 1 day. Higher ∆E values were achieved for specimens stored in curry solution, followed by red wine, cress solution, and distilled water. Resin composite Lava Ultimate showed larger ∆E values compared with the resin hybrid ceramic VITA Enamic and leucite ceramic IPS Empress CAD. Specimens stored at 37°C showed significantly less discoloration than those stored at 55°C. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of coloration of the materials depends on food and temperature and was most pronounced with Lava Ultimate.",2019,1,1,
81, Colour stability of sectional laminate veneers: A laboratory study,"B. Elter, A. Aladağ, M. E. Çömlekoğlu, M. Dündar Çömlekoğlu and A. Kesercioğlu", Aust Dent J," BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the colour stability of sectional laminate veneers (SLVs) fabricated with four and cemented with two different materials. METHODS: Eighty SLVs were prepared with a thickness of 0.2-0.4 mm from IPS e.max CAD, Lava Ultimate, CEREC Blocs and IPS InLine and were cemented with Variolink Veneer and Variolink N to form eight groups (n:10). After cementation, specimens underwent 5000 thermocyles prior to immersion in a coffee solution. RESULTS: Colour change before and after thermal cycling did not reveal significant differences (P > 0.05). After coffee immersion, significant colour change was observed in all groups (P > 0.05). Only IPS InLine cemented with Variolink Veneer was considered clinically acceptable (∆E < 3.3). According to observer scorings, marginal discolouration was higher in Lava Ultimate, while no discolouration was observed in IPS InLine. Dual or light-curing resin cements showed insignificant differences. CONCLUSIONS: SLVs fabricated with different aesthetic materials underwent perceptible (∆E > 3.3) discolouration except for the IPS InLine cemented with light-curing resin cement. Cementation with either dual-curing or light-curing resin cements does not by itself affect colour stability. The highest marginal discolouration was in the Lava Ultimate group while no discolouration was detected in the IPS InLine group.",2021,0,0,
362, Mechanical properties and DIC analyses of CAD/CAM materials,"T. Porto, R. Roperto, A. Akkus, O. Akkus, S. Porto-Neto, S. Teich, L. Lang and E. Campos", J Clin Exp Dent," BACKGROUND: This study compared two well-known computer-aided-design/computer-aided-manufactured (CAD/CAM) blocks (Paradigm MZ100 [3M ESPE] and Vitablocs Mark II [Vita] in terms of fracture toughness (Kic), index of brittleness (BI) and stress/strain distributions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three-point bending test was used to calculate the fracture toughness, and the relationship between the Kic and the Vickers hardness was used to calculate the index of brittleness. Additionally, digital image correlation (DIC) was used to analyze the stress/strain distribution on both materials. RESULTS: The values for fracture toughness obtained under three-point bending were 1.87Pa√m (±0.69) for Paradigm MZ100 and 1.18Pa√m (±0.17) for Vitablocs Mark II. For the index of brittleness, the values for Paradigm and Vitablocs were 73.13μm-1/2 (±30.72) and 550.22μm-1/2 (±82.46). One-way ANOVA was performed to find differences (α=0.05) and detected deviation between the stress/strain distributions on both materials. CONCLUSIONS: Both CAD/CAM materials tested presented similar fracture toughness, but, different strain/stress distributions. Both materials may perform similarly when used in CAD/CAM restorations.

149, Effect of photo-polymerization mode on the degree of conversion of resin cement under different ceramic materials,"K. Ebeid, A. Sabet, N. Rafla, N. Al-Haj Husain and M. Özcan", Minerva Dent Oral Sci," BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effect of different polymerization modes and duration on the degree of conversion (DC) of resin cement under different types of ceramics. METHODS: Ceramic materials were divided into 3 groups (N.=60): group 1, Cerasmart; group 2, Vita Enamic; and group 3, Vita Mark II. Each group was then divided into three subgroups (N.=20) according to the polymerization mode (A: low-intensity; B: high-intensity; and C: soft-start). Subgroups were then divided into two further groups according to the polymerization time (I: 10 s; and II: 20 s). DC of light-cured resin cement beneath different kinds of ceramics was tested using FTIR spectroscopy. Results were compared to a control group cured without overlying ceramic. RESULTS: While the type of ceramic and mode of polymerization showed a significant effect on the DC of resin cement, polymerization duration did not. Vita Mark II group showed the highest DC of resin cement followed by Vita Enamic and Cerasmart. High- and low-intensity polymerization modes did not show significant difference, but both showed significantly lower DC when compared to soft start mode. CONCLUSIONS: Type of ceramic and polymerization mode showed a direct effect on the DC of resin cement.",2021,1,0,
434, Resin cements effect on the final color of novel monolithic CAD/CAM restorations,"A. S. Küçükekenci, M. Kurt and D. Dede", Minerva Stomatol," BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effect of resin cement shade on the final color of computer aided design/computer aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) restorations. METHODS: Thirty CAD/CAM block specimens were fabricated (14×12×1.5 mm) by cutting blocks (Vita Mark II [VM], Vita Enamic [VE], and Lava Ultimate [LU]). Forty cement specimens were prepared (14×12×0.2 mm) using resin cement (RelyX Ultimate Tr, A1, A3O, Bl). Color measurements of CAD/CAM specimens were made without (control) and with each /shade of resin cement (test) with a spectrophotometer. Color differences (ΔE00) between the control and test groups were calculated and analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and subsequent pairwise testing. Comparisons were performed by using Tukey's multiple comparison tests (α=0.05). RESULTS: Both cement shade and interaction between cement shade CAD/CAM block type parameters were significant on color differences (P<0.05). A3O cement resulted in a clinically unacceptable color differences (ΔE00>2.25) for each tested CAD/CAM blocks. ΔE00 values of VM_A1 and VE_A1 groups were also higher than clinically unacceptable level (ΔE00>2.25). ΔE00 value of VE_Tr was lower than visually perceptible level (∆E00≤1.30). There was no statistically significant difference found between the ∆E00 values of CAD/CAM blocks in the same shade of cement groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Tested CAD/CAM blocks were similarly affected by the cement shade and thus may have similar optical features.",2018,0,0,
78, Color compatibility between dental structures and three different types of ceramic systems,"I. S. Pop-Ciutrila, R. Ghinea, H. A. Colosi, J. Ruiz-López, M. M. Perez, R. D. Paravina and D. Dudea", BMC Oral Health," BACKGROUND: To assess color compatibility between dental structures (human enamel and dentine) and three different types of ceramic systems. METHODS: Samples (1 and 2 mm-thick) of extracted tooth (containing dentine and enamel areas) and three ceramic systems with different shades and opacities (HT-High Translucent, T-Translucent) were prepared for this study: Vita Suprinity-VS (HT, T; A1, A2, A3, A3.5, B2, C2, D2) (Vita Zahnfabrik); Vita Enamic-VE (HT, T; 1M1, 1M2, 2M2, 3M2) (Vita Zahnfabrik) and Noritake Super Porcelain EX-3-NKT (A1, A2, A3, A3.5, B2, C2, D2) (Kuraray Noritake Dental). Reflectance measurements of all samples were performed over black backgrounds using a non-contact spectroradiometer (SpectraScan PR-670, Photo Research) under a CIE 45°/0° geometry. CIE L*a*b* color parameters were measured and CIELAB/CIEDE2000 color differences (ΔE(00)/ΔE(*)(ab)) and corresponding Coverage Error (CE) of ceramic system for dentine or enamel samples were calculated. Color data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc multiple comparisons tests. CE values were interpreted by comparisons with available 50:50% acceptability color threshold (AT) for dentistry. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in lightness were found among all ceramic systems and human dentine (p < 0.001), while no significant differences were registered between enamel and VSHT, T and VEHT. 1 mm dentine showed no statistical differences with VST and VSHT for a* coordinate, while 2 mm dentine showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) with VEHT. Thin samples (1 mm) of dentine and enamel showed significant statistical differences (p < 0.05) for b* coordinate with less translucent materials (NKT, VET and VST). For dentine samples, none of the ceramic materials provided a CE lower than AT. VSHT provided the best CE for 1 mm-thick (CE(00) = 1.7, CE(ab) = 1.9) and for 2 mm-thick (CE(00) = 2.3; CE(ab) = 2.5) enamel samples. CONCLUSIONS: Color coordinates of evaluated esthetic ceramic systems were statistically different from those of human dentine in almost all cases. The evaluated ZrO(2) lithium silicate glass-ceramic (VS), with its two levels of translucency, provided lower CE values with human enamel samples while conventional feldspathic ceramic (NKT) and hybrid ceramic systems (VE) demonstrated a better color compatibility with dentin samples.",2021,1,0,
506, The impact of different surface treatments on the shear bond strength of orthodontic metal brackets applied to different CAD/CAM composites,"R. M. de Almeida, V. Hass, D. Y. Sasaki, S. B. Berger, T. M. Fernandes and M. R. Tonetto", J Clin Exp Dent," BACKGROUND: To investigate the shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic metal brackets applied to different CAD/CAM composites treated with different surface treatments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens of two CAD/CAM composites were obtained of Lava Ultimate (LU; n=60) and Brilliant Crios (BC; n=60) which were randomly separated into six subgroups (n=10) according to the surface treatment: control (CTL); sandblasting (SB); sandblasting and silane (SBSL); hydrofluoric acid (HF); hydrofluoric acid and silane (HFSL); and Monobond Etch&Prime (MEP). The mandibular central incisor metal brackets were bonded with a light-cure adhesive. The SBS data were analyzed using the two-way analysis of variance and Turkey's test, while the adhesive remnant index (ARI) by the Kruskal-Wallis, all the significance was set at 5%. RESULTS: A higher SBS was found for BC in comparison with LU (p< 0.05). All the surface treatments increased the SBS in comparison with CTL (p< 0.0001). Treatment with HF, SBSL and HFSL (p> 0.05) showed a higher SBS, which was followed by MEP and SB (p> 0.05), all in comparison with CTL (p< 0.0001). For ARI, a significant effect was detected only for the surface treatment (p< 0.01), and not for CAD/CAM resin (p> 0.05). Significant differences were detected between CTL to HF, and HF to MEP, as well. CONCLUSIONS: The SBS is highly affected by the surface treatment and also by the CAD/CAM composite. The surface treatment improves the SBS and should be encouraged when orthodontic brackets are bonded to CAD/CAM composites.

502, The efficiency of laser application for debonding laminate restorations manufactured of current CAD-CAM materials with different thicknesses,"A. K. Culhaoglu, M. A. Kilicarslan, B. Gokdeniz and G. Gur", Niger J Clin Pract," BACKGROUND: Using lasers for adhesive restoration removal can be practical and atraumatic. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate Er: YAG laser exposure on debonding the adhesive cementation between enamel and feldspar ceramic, lithium disilicate-reinforced and resin nano ceramic composite laminate restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vita Cerec Blocs, IPS e.max Computer-aided design (CAD). Computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD-CAM) in full and Lava Ultimate restorative materials were chosen. The 3 × 3 mm(2) standardized, 0.5-mm and 1 mm thick specimens were cemented on an enamel surface. After thermocycling, each material group was randomly divided into laser treated and control (non-laser treated) groups. Shear bond strength test was done with a universal testing machine with crosshead speed 0.5 mm/min. Factorial ANOVA Technique and TUKEY HSD multiple comparison test were used for statistical analyses. Moreover, the surface morphology of the debonded samples and the enamel was observed using a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: The laser application was found to weaken the SBS values significantly (P < 0.05) for all groups; however, the most dramatic SBS decrease was observed for laser treated IPS e.max at both thicknesses. CONCLUSIONS: Laser treatment can serve as a practical and effective method that eliminates the risk the enamel damage and restoration fracture.",2021,1,1,
525, Vickers Micro-Hardness of New Restorative CAD/CAM Dental Materials: Evaluation and Comparison after Exposure to Acidic Drink,"M. Colombo, C. Poggio, A. Lasagna, M. Chiesa and A. Scribante", Materials (Basel)," CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) for indirect restorative materials has been recently introduced in dentistry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the change of the surface micro-hardness of different restorative CAD/CAM materials after exposure to a carbonated acidic drink (Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Company, Milan, Italy). One hundred and eighty specimens of identical size (2 mm thickness) were obtained by sectioning each tested CAD/CAM block of four materials: a hybrid ceramic (CERASMART™, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), a resin nano ceramic (Lava™ Ultimate, 3M, Monrovia, CA, USA), a nanohybrid composite (Grandio blocs, VOCO GmbH, Cuxhaven, Germany), and a zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass ceramic (VITA SUPRINITY(®) PC; VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany). Forty-five specimens of each material were tested. Micro-hardness was measured at baseline, after 7 days and after 28 days. The data were analyzed. The micro-hardness of each material varied significantly after immersion in Coca-Cola. The nanohybrid composite had a high initial micro-hardness and the greatest percentage loss after acid exposure. The hybrid ceramic and the resin nano ceramic had similar percentage losses of micro-hardness values even if the second material had higher initial values. The zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass ceramic had the highest baseline values and the lowest percentage loss of micro-hardness. The different CAD/CAM materials presented different micro-hardness values before and after acid exposure.",2019,1,1,
520," Translucency, hardness and strength parameters of PMMA resin containing graphene-like material for CAD/CAM restorations","S. V. Agarwalla, R. Malhotra and V. Rosa", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," CAD/CAM restorations can be produced from several ceramic and hybrid materials. The moderate mechanical properties of PMMA based resin have hindered its use for permanent restorations. Recently, a graphene reinforced PMMA namely G-CAM has been introduced for permanent CAD/CAM restorations. Although graphene family materials have been successfully used as a reinforcement phase in a variety of polymers, the properties and mechanical behavior of PMMA resin containing graphene-like materials remain unknown. Herein, we have evaluated the translucency, hardness and strength parameters (flexural strength, Weibull modulus and characteristic strength) of G-CAM A1 (GA1) and G-CAM B2 (GB2) and benchmarked it against a unmodified PMMA resin (PM), two polymer/ceramic hybrid materials [Vita Enamic (VE) and Lava Ultimate (LU)] and one ceramic (e.max, EX) for CAD/CAM restorations. The trends for the translucency parameter were similar for all materials at all thickness tested. The hardness for GA1, GB2 and PM were significantly lower than VE, LU and EX. The biaxial flexural strengths of GA1, GB2, PM and VE were approximately 150 MPa but significantly lower than LU and EX (201 and 313 MPa). All materials presented Weibull modulus higher than 10, except EX (m = 8) The stresses required to fracture 5% and 63.2% of specimens (σ(5%) and σ(0)) were similar for GA1, GB2, PM and VE but significantly lower than LU and EX. Overall, the PMMA modified by graphene-like materials presented properties comparable with unmodified PM and VE.",2019,1,0,
357, Measurement of J-integral in CAD/CAM dental ceramics and composite resin by digital image correlation,"Y. Jiang, A. Akkus, R. Roperto, O. Akkus, B. Li, L. Lang and S. Teich", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," Ceramic and composite resin blocks for CAD/CAM machining of dental restorations are becoming more common. The sample sizes affordable by these blocks are smaller than ideal for stress intensity factor (SIF) based tests. The J-integral measurement calls for full field strain measurement, making it challenging to conduct. Accordingly, the J-integral values of dental restoration materials used in CAD/CAM restorations have not been reported to date. Digital image correlation (DIC) provides full field strain maps, making it possible to calculate the J-integral value. The aim of this study was to measure the J-integral value for CAD/CAM restorative materials. Four types of materials (sintered IPS E-MAX CAD, non-sintered IPS E-MAX CAD, Vita Mark II and Paradigm MZ100) were used to prepare beam samples for three-point bending tests. J-integrals were calculated for different integral path size and locations with respect to the crack tip. J-integral at path 1 for each material was 1.26±0.31×10(-4)MPam for MZ 100, 0.59±0.28×10(-4)MPam for sintered E-MAX, 0.19±0.07×10(-4)MPam for VM II, and 0.21±0.05×10(-4)MPam for non-sintered E-MAX. There were no significant differences between different integral path size, except for the non-sintered E-MAX group. J-integral paths of non-sintered E-MAX located within 42% of the height of the sample provided consistent values whereas outside this range resulted in lower J-integral values. Moreover, no significant difference was found among different integral path locations. The critical SIF was calculated from J-integral (KJ) along with geometry derived SIF values (KI). KI values were comparable with KJ and geometry based SIF values obtained from literature. Therefore, DIC derived J-integral is a reliable way to assess the fracture toughness of small sized specimens for dental CAD/CAM restorative materials; however, with caution applied to the selection of J-integral path.",2016,0,1,
90, Comparative study of the wear of the pair human teeth/Vita Enamic® vs commonly used dental ceramics through chewing simulation,"F. Santos, A. Branco, M. Polido, A. P. Serro and C. G. Figueiredo-Pina", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," Ceramic based prosthetic materials have been used in dental restorations due to their excellent aesthetic and biocompatibility. However, due to concerns related to their mechanical properties and abrasive action against natural teeth, a proper selection of these materials is crucial to preserve the occlusal interactions and prevent abnormal dental wear. The aim of this work is to compare the wear performance of Vita Enamic®, a polymer infiltrated ceramic (PIC), with that of other three commercial ceramic based dental materials - Zirconia, Leucite and Zirconia Veneered - when tested against natural teeth. The crystalline structure, wettability, topography and hardness of the prosthetic materials were characterized before wear testing. Chewing simulator experiments (360,000 cycles, load 49 N) against dental human cusps were carried out using artificial saliva as lubricant. The wear of both teeth and prosthetic materials was quantified and the involved wear mechanisms were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that Zirconia presented the most suitable tribological behavior, since it led to the lowest wear on both occlusal surfaces. The prosthetic material presenting the highest wear was Vita Enamic®. Regarding the cusps' wear, the highest values were found for both Leucite and Zirconia Veneered. Polishing wear was the main wear mechanism in Zirconia system (prosthetic material and opposing enamel), while in the remaining ones was fragile fracture associated with abrasive wear. No direct relation could be established between wettability, initial roughness and hardness of the prosthetic materials and the wear of the tribological systems. Contrarily, microstructure and toughness revealed to be critical parameters.",2018,1,0,
102, Degradation of Computer-aided Design/Computer-aided Manufacturing Composites by Dietary Solvents: An Optical Three-dimensional Surface Analysis,"S. M. Munusamy, A. U. Yap, H. L. Ching and N. A. Yahya", Oper Dent," CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) composite resins are susceptible to degradation by dietary solvents. Dietary counselling is prudent when placing such CAD/CAM restorations. SUMMARY: This study determined the effect of dietary solvents on the surface roughness (Ra) of direct, indirect, and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) dental composites. The materials evaluated were a direct composite (Filtek Z350 XT [FZ]), an indirect composite (Shofu Ceramage [CM]), and four CAD/CAM composites (Lava Ultimate [LU], Shofu Block HC [HC], Cerasmart [CS], and Vita Enamic [VE]). Specimens (12×14×1.5 mm) of each material were prepared, measured for baseline Ra, ranked, divided into six groups (n=12), and conditioned in the following media for 1 week at 37°C: air (control), distilled water, 0.02 N citric acid, 0.02 N lactic acid, heptane, and 50% ethanol-water solution. The composite specimens were then subjected to postconditioning Ra testing using an optical three-dimensional surface analyzer (G4e, Alicona Imaging GmbH, Raaba, Austria). Inter-medium and inter-material comparisons were performed with one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni test at a significance level of α=0.05. Mean Ra values ranged from 0.086 ± 0.004 μm to 0.153 ± 0.005 μm for the various material/medium combinations. For all materials, conditioning in air (control) and distilled water generally resulted in significantly lower mean Ra than exposure to other dietary solvents. Conditioning in citric acid presented the roughest surfaces for FZ, CM, and CS. For LU, HC, and VE, exposure to lactic acid, heptane, and ethanol solution resulted in the highest mean Ra. Regardless of conditioning media, FZ had the highest and VE the lowest mean Ra compared with other composites. The CAD/CAM composites remained susceptible to surface degradation by dietary solvents despite their industrial polymerization.",2020,0,1,
240, Fracture Resistance and Failure Mode of Custom-made Post-and-cores of Polyetheretherketone and Nano-ceramic Composite,"K. N. Teixeira, T. M. Duque, H. P. Maia and T. Gonçalves", Oper Dent," CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Custom-made post-and-cores of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and nano-ceramic composite showed good fracture resistance and failure mode. Clinicians should be aware that these materials might be an efficient alternative for post-and-cores, because they promote esthetics while reducing the risk of root fractures. SUMMARY: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance and failure mode of custom-made post-and-cores manufactured with different esthetic materials.Methods and Materials: A total of 48 mandibular premolar extracted teeth were selected, endodontically treated, and prepared to receive the posts. Specimens were randomly divided into four groups (n=12/group): group 1, polyetheretherketone (PEEK, Degos; G1); group 2, nano-ceramic composite (Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE; G2); group 3, cast metal post (NiCr alloy, control; G3); group 4, fiberglass post (Whitepost, FGM, control; G4) customized with a nano-hybrid resin composite (Z250, 3M ESPE). Experimental post-and-cores (G1 and G2) were manufactured with a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing system. All posts were cemented with self-adhesive resin cement (Rely X U200, 3M ESPE), and specimens were stored in distilled water at 37°C for 60 days. A universal testing machine was used to measure the fracture resistance (0.5 mm/min at an angle of 45° to the long axis of the tooth). Fractures were classified as repairable or catastrophic. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc and χ2 tests for independence and Bonferroni adjustments were applied (α=0.05).Results: The fracture resistance values (mean ± SD, in newtons) were 379.4 ± 119.8 (G1), 506.4 ± 138 (G2), 939.6 ± 146.5 (G3), and 449.6 ± 66.5 (G4). Only G3 exhibited a significant difference (p<0.05). The χ2 test showed an association between failure mode and post-and-core material [χ2(3) = 23.65; p<0.001]. After Bonferroni adjustment, only G3 presented a higher than expected incidence of catastrophic failures (p<0.001). In the remaining groups, most failures were repairable and related to debonding.Conclusions: Customized post-and-cores of PEEK and nano-ceramic composites exhibited good mechanical performance. Their fracture resistance was comparable to that observed for fiberglass customized posts, yet lower than that for cast metal posts. For PEEK post-and-cores, in particular, additional studies are needed to improve adhesiveness and reduce the risk of debonding.",2020,1,1,
327, Interfacial Evaluation of CAD/CAM Resin Inlays on the Cavity Floor Using Swept-source Optical Coherence Tomography,"S. H. Han, Y. Shimada, A. Sadr, J. Tagami and S. E. Yang", Oper Dent," CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When a resin nanoceramic inlay is cemented using self-adhesive cement, a universal dentin adhesive can be applied to the prepared cavity. The application of the adhesive before self-adhesive cement placement provides similar or better interfacial adaptation than without the adhesive. SUMMARY: Purpose: The first objective of this study was to determine whether the luting material used for computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacture resin nanoceramic inlays affected interfacial adaptation. The second objective was to investigate whether application of a universal dentin adhesive before cementation affected interfacial adaptation. The final objective was to compare the inlay-side and dentin-side interfaces in the cement space.Methods and Materials: Seventy-four class I cavities were prepared on extracted human third molars. Cavities were optically scanned, and resin nanoceramic inlays were milled using Lava Ultimate blocks (3M ESPE). For the control groups, the fabricated inlays were cemented using Panavia V5 (Kuraray Noritake) or FujiCem 2 (GC). For the experimental groups, the teeth were randomly divided into groups I and II. Group I contained four subgroups using different luting materials; in all subgroups, the inlays were cemented and dual cured without pretreatment. Group II contained six subgroups in which inlays were cemented and dual cured after application of a universal dentin adhesive. After thermocycling, interfacial adaptation was measured using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging and statistically compared among groups.Results: Interfacial adaptation was different depending on the luting material used (p<0.05). After application of a universal adhesive, some subgroups showed improved interfacial adaptation (p<0.05). In the comparison of inlay-side and dentin-side interfaces, no difference was found in interfacial adaptation (p>0.05).Conclusions: Interfacial adaptation for resin nanoceramic inlays differed with luting material. For some self-adhesive cements, application of a universal adhesive before cementation improved interfacial adaptation.",2020,1,0,

Sasaki, H. Kitagawa, R. Kitagawa, S. Thaweboon, T. Srikhirin and S. Imazato", Dent Mater J," Composite resin blocks for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications have recently become available. However, CAD/CAM composite resins have lower wear resistance and accumulate more plaque than CAD/CAM ceramic materials. We assessed the effects of SiO(2)-nanocomposite film coating of four types of CAD/CAM composite resin blocks: Cerasmart, Katana Avencia block, Lava Ultimate, and Block HC on surface hardness and bacterial attachment. All composite blocks with coating demonstrated significantly greater Vickers hardness, reduced surface roughness, and greater hydrophobicity than those without coating. Adhesion of Streptococcus mutans to the coated specimens was significantly less than those for the uncoated specimens. These reduced levels of bacterial adherence on the coated surface were still evident after treatment with saliva. Surface modification by SiO(2)-nanocomposite film coating has potential to improve wear resistance and susceptibility to plaque accumulation of CAD/CAM composite resin restorations.",2017,0,1,

Porto-Neto and E. A. Campos", Dent Mater J," Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials were submitted to thermocycling, to identify changes in mechanical behavior. Four CAD/CAM materials were divided in four subordinate groups (n=9): (1) dry out for 7 days, (2) distilled water at 37(o)C for 7 days, (3) 60,000 thermocycles, and (4) 120,000 thermocycles. Following thermocycling, samples were submitted to three-point bending test. Two-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's test were performed (α=0.05). The IPS e.max CAD had a flexural strength of 396±75 MPa and flexural modulus of 84±11 GPa, followed by Vita Enamic with values of 153±17 MPa and 28±5 GPa respectively. The flexural strength recorded for Lava Ultimate was 149±28 MPa and the flexural modulus was 12±3 GPa. Vitablocs Mark II had the lowest flexural strength values (125±10 MPa) and a flexural modulus of 49±15 GPa.

210, Evaluation of the Surface Characteristics of Dental CAD/CAM Materials after Different Surface Treatments,"K. Papadopoulos, K. Pahinis, K. Saltidou, D. Dionysopoulos and E. Tsitrou", Materials (Basel)," Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology was developed to ensure the sufficient strength of tooth restorations, to improve esthetic restorations with a natural appearance and to make the techniques easier, faster and more accurate. In the view of the limited research on the surface treatments of the CAD/CAM materials and the need to evaluate the ideal surface characteristics of a material to achieve the best adhesion to tooth tissues, this study aimed to investigate the surface roughness and morphology of four different CAD/CAM materials using four different surface treatments. The CAD/CAM materials used in this study were three composites (Shofu Block HC, Lava Ultimate and Brilliant Crios) and a hybrid ceramic (Enamic). The surface of the specimens of each material received one of the following treatments: no surface treatment, sandblasting with 29 μm Al(2)O(3) particles, 9% hydrofluoric acid etching and silane application, and the tribochemical method using CoJet System. Surface roughness was evaluated using optical profilometry, and surface morphology was observed by means of scanning electron microscopy. All surface treatments resulted in higher surface roughness values compared to the control group. Different treatments affected the surface properties of the materials, presumably due to discrepancies in their composition and structure.",2020,1,1,
507, The influence of FRC base and bonded CAD/CAM resin composite endocrowns on fatigue behavior of cracked endodontically-treated molars,"Y. O. C. Anton, J. Bijelic-Donova, C. M. Saratti, P. K. Vallittu, E. di Bella, I. Krejci and G. T. Rocca", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," Cracked endodontically treated molars (ETMs) are commonly treated with full crowns. Less invasive techniques could include fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) base and adhesively bonded endocrowns. The purpose of this study was to assess the fatigue resistance of ETMs restored with CAD/CAM resin composite endocrowns and reinforced with different FRC bases. Cracks were simulated in fifty mandibular molars by cutting the teeth longitudinally and reassembling the two parts. After performing endodontic treatments and preparing cavities, teeth were restored in one of the following methods (n = 10). In Group 1, cavity floors were lined with 0.5 mm of flowable composite (Universal Injectable; GUI, shade A2). In Groups 2 and 3, the cavity floors were covered with one and three layers of FRC-net (ES Net) respectively, whereas in Groups 4 and 5 with 1 mm and 2 mm of flowable FRC-resin (EverX Flow Dentin; EXFD) respectively. Endocrowns (Cerasmart 270; CE, A2 HT) with 5 mm thickness were adhesively luted with preheated composite and all specimens were subjected to cyclic loading in water at 5 Hz, starting with a load of 600 N (5000 cycles), followed by stages of 1000, 1300, 1600, 1900, 2200 and 2500 at a maximum of 20 000 cycles each. Results were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Log-Rank test (p = 0.05). The fatigue failure load of ES Net applied in three layers (1617 N ± 371) or in one layer (1499 N ± 306), as well as EXFD applied in 2 mm (1496 N ± 264) or in 1 mm (1434 N ± 372) did not differ significantly (p > 0.05). Control teeth fractured at 1255 N ± 350 (p > 0.05). In the fiber-reinforced groups, restorable fractures were observed in 50%-80%, with only 30% deemed restorable in the control group. The fractures originated mainly at the occlusal contact points and the main crack propagated in the corono-apical direction. No crack origin (primary or secondary) starting from the artificial pre-existing crack was observed in fractured specimens. FRC bases did not improve the fatigue resistance of cracked ETMs, but favorably influenced the failure mode.",2021,0,1,
490, The effect of endodontic access on the failure load of lithium disilicate and resin nanoceramic CAD/CAM crowns,C. Lund and P. Guevara, Gen Dent," Currently, there is no consensus on whether crowns fabricated via computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) need to be replaced following an endodontic procedure. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of endodontic access preparation and repair on the failure load of lithium disilicate and resin nanoceramic crowns. The hypothesis was that there would be no difference in the failure load between the intact and repaired crowns. Eighty identical mandibular CAD/CAM crowns (40 lithium disilicate glass ceramic [IPS e.max CAD] and 40 resin nanoceramic [Lava Ultimate]) were milled and cemented on 80 identical polymethyl methacrylate resin dies. A standardized endodontic access preparation was made in half the specimens and restored with composite resin. All crowns were subjected to an occlusal load with a hydraulic testing machine until failure. Based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test, the load to failure was significantly higher for the lithium disilicate crowns than for resin nanoceramic crowns in both the intact and repaired groups (P < 0.001). For the lithium disilicate crowns, the failure load was significantly higher for intact than for repaired specimens (P = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference between intact and repaired specimens for resin nanoceramic. The repair of lithium disilicate and resin nanoceramic CAD/CAM crowns may provide a serviceable restoration under normal occlusal loads. However, replacement would be prudent in cases where parafunctional occlusal loading is suspected, the crown was not adhesively cemented, or there is an obvious defect in the existing crown.",2018,1,0,
40," Blue-Light Transmittance of Esthetic Monolithic CAD/CAM Materials With Respect to Their Composition, Thickness, and Curing Conditions","B. Stawarczyk, D. Awad and N. Ilie", Oper Dent," Determining the amount of blue light (360-540nm) passing through nine monolithic computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials depends on material thickness, initial irradiance, and the distance between the curing unit and the specimen's surface. A total of 180 specimens of two thicknesses (1 mm and 2 mm, n=10/subgroup) were fabricated from TelioCAD, VITA CAD-Temp (VCT), experimental nanocomposite, LAVA Ultimate (LU), VITA ENAMIC (VE), VITA MarkII (VM), IPS EmpressCAD (IEC), IPS e.maxCAD (IEM), and CELTRA DUO (CD). The irradiance passing through the CAD/CAM materials and thicknesses was measured using a light-emitting-diode curing unit with standard-power, high-power, and plasma modes by means of a USB4000 spectrometer. The curing unit was placed directly on the specimen's surface at 2- and 4-mm distances from the specimen's surface. Data were analyzed using a multivariate analysis and one-way analysis of variance with the post hoc Scheffé test (p<0.05). The highest transmitted irradiance was measured for VM and LU, followed by VCT and IEC, while the lowest values showed VE, followed by IEM and CD. The highest transmitted irradiance was recorded by exposing the material to the plasma mode, followed by the high- and standard-power modes. The measured irradiance was decreased by increasing the specimen's thickness from 1 to 2 mm. Fewer differences were measured when the curing unit was placed at 0 or 2 mm from the specimen's surface, and the irradiance passing through the specimens was lower at a distance of 4 mm.",2016,0,1,

Surgical procedures may now be performed in a single visit utilizing chairside, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing technology and in situations when a two-stage implant protocol is indicated as demonstrated in this case. The CEREC® GALILEOS® integration workflow system was used to prosthetically plan and place an implant in the lower right mandibular first molar site, No. 30, which had been previously grafted following tooth extraction. Preoperative planning was performed, taking into consideration all anatomic landmarks, current tissue status, and restorative needs while incorporating cone-beam computed tomography data to design and mill a stable, tooth-supported surgical guide (CEREC Guide 2.0). After placement and subsequent osseointegration, the implant was restored chairside in a pre-doctoral treatment center.

352, Marginal gap and fracture resistance of CAD/CAM ceramill COMP and cerasmart endocrowns for restoring endodontically treated molars bonded with two adhesive protocols: an in vitro study,"I. A. Kassem, I. E. Farrag, S. M. Zidan, J. F. ElGuindy and R. S. Elbasty", Biomater Investig Dent," Endocrowns represent a conservative and esthetic restorative alternative to full coverage crowns. They can be constructed using various CAD/CAM materials that can provide a modulus of elasticity similar to that of teeth. The ability to use of such materials in composite blocks that can be easily repaired is also an advantage, provided appropriate bonding performance is ensured. This study, therefore, evaluated the marginal gap and fracture resistance of two CAD/CAM endocrown materials using two bonding protocols. Thirty-two mandibular molars were evaluated in two groups based on the material type: a Cerasmart group (GC America Inc; n = 16) acting as the control and a Ceramill COMP group (Amann Girrbach, Germany; n = 16). These groups were then classified according to the bonding protocol used: a total-etch bonding protocol (n = 8) and a self-etch bonding protocol (n = 8) implemented using RelyX ultimate adhesive resin cement (3M ESPE). The samples were then subjected to aging by simulating a 1-year thermo-mechanical process. The marginal gap results were statistically insignificant across the material and bonding protocol groups before thermo-mechanical aging. Thermo-mechanical aging significantly reduced the marginal gap distance for Ceramill COMP endocrowns cemented using the total-etch protocol (p = 0.002). No statistically significant difference was recorded for the fracture resistance in either the material or bonding protocol groups (p ≥ 0.05). Both materials and bonding protocols can, therefore, be used in the posterior region providing conservative treatment, adequate marginal gap and fracture resistance.",2020,0,1,

Karacaer", Microsc Res Tech," Endocrowns were manufactured using different restorative materials to evaluate the marginal adaptation and fracture strength. Fifty endodontically treated mandibular first molar teeth were divided into five groups (n = 10). Endocrowns were obtained from lithium disilicate glass ceramic ingots by heat-press technique (Group e.max Press: GEP), and from feldspathic blocks (Group Cerec: GC), polymer infiltrated ceramic network blocks (Group Enamic: GE), lithium disilicate glass ceramic blocks (Group e.max CAD: GEC), and zirconia-reinforced glass ceramic blocks (Group Suprinity: GS) by CAD/CAM technique. After thermocycling, marginal adaptation was evaluated under scanning electron microscope at ×200 magnification. The specimens' fracture strengths were tested in universal test machine, and fracture types were evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed with Kruskal-Wallis test. The highest marginal gap value was found in GEP, but no significant differences were determined among the other four groups (p > .05). Significant differences were observed among the groups in terms of fracture strength (p = .019). The fracture strength values of GEC were significantly higher than GE, GC, and GS (p < .05). Values were not significantly different between the GEC and GEP groups (p > .05). CAD/CAM endocrowns showed better marginal adaptation than heat-pressed endocrowns. Clinically acceptable marginal gaps were seen in both endocrown types. Both CAD/CAM and heat-pressed lithium disilicate glass ceramic endocrowns showed higher fracture strength.",2021,1,0,

Kleverlaan", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," Hybrid ceramic is a promising material for monolithic restorations that could require an individualization through the extrinsic staining to improve aesthetics. Due to the possibilities to treat this ceramic prior to staining, this study evaluated the wear resistance of surface treatments prior to staining and glazing a hybrid ceramic. Thirty-two specimens (Vita Enamic) were divided into 8 groups according to the surface treatment prior to the staining (Polishing: Pol, Acid etching: Ac, Sandblasting with Al(2)O(3): Sd or Self-etching silane: Ses) and glaze application (with: gl or without: gl). The specimens were submitted to the ACTA wear machine simulating the presence of food bolus and antagonist. The wear rate of the stain was determined after 7 intervals of 20,000 cycles, using a profilometer. The surface before and after staining, and after wear were inspected using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The rates were analyzed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey test. The wear was affected by surface treatment, glaze application and number of cycles (p < 0.001). 100% of the staining was removed after 20,000 cycles for Pol, 40,000 for Pol + gl, 60,000 for Ses + gl, 80,000 for Ac, 100,000 for Sd and Ses, 120,000 for Ac + gl and 140,000 for Sd + gl. SEM showed similar worn surfaces. Sandblasting followed by glaze application was the most durable treatment to maintain the external staining on the hybrid ceramic surface when subjected to three-body wear.",2020,1,0,

Mirzaei and V. Thompson", J Lasers Med Sci," Introduction: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different surface treatments of a hybrid ceramic, Vita Enamic, on the micro-tensile bond strength (µ-TBS) to resin cement. Methods: Ten blocks (3×10×8 mm) were retrieved from the original blocks and divided into 5 groups according to the different surface treatments performed: Groups 1: 35% acid phosphoric for 60 seconds (PA); group 2: Sandblasting with 50 µm Al(2) O(3) particles for 10 seconds (SB); groups 3: 9.5% hydrofluoric acid for 60 seconds (HF), group 4: The Er:YAG laser (2 W, 10 Hz) (ER1), group 5: The Er:YAG laser (3 W, 10 Hz) (ER2). All treated surfaces were salinized and the blocks with similar surface treatments were bonded together using a dual-cured resin cement and light-cured. After 24-hour storage in water, the blocks were cut into beams (1 mm(2)). Half of the specimens in each group (n=16) were tested immediately and the rest were subjected to thermocycling between 5°C and 55°C for 6000 cycles before the µ-TBS test at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD tests and the significance level was set at 0.05. The failure mode was evaluated by using a stereomicroscope. Results: The µ-TBS was clearly influenced by surface treatment methods (P < 0.001) and thermocycling significantly decreased the bond strength values in all groups (P = 0.007). The highest value (66.07 MPa ± 11.3) was obtained for the HF groups with no thermocycling and the lowest values were observed in the laser groups with no significant difference among different irradiation parameters. Adhesive failure was mainly observed in the PA and SB groups while mixed failure was predominantly shown in the laser and HF groups. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that surface treatment of VE with HF and salinization could improve the bond strength to a dual-cured resin cement, and Er:YAG laser irradiation with the evaluated parameters did not promote the adhesion of the resin cement to VE.",2019,1,0,

On Behalf Of The Dutch Pancreatic Cancer", Cancers (Basel)," Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a novel image-guided tumor ablation technique with the ability to generate a window for the establishment of systemic antitumor immunity. IRE transiently alters the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment while simultaneously generating antigen release, thereby instigating an adaptive immune response. Combining IRE with immunotherapeutic drugs, i.e., electroimmunotherapy, has synergistic potential and might induce a durable antitumor response. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of the combination of IRE with IMO-2125 (a toll-like receptor 9 ligand) and/or nivolumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC). In this randomized controlled phase I clinical trial, 18 patients with mPDAC pretreated with chemotherapy will be enrolled in one of three study arms: A (control): nivolumab monotherapy; B: percutaneous IRE of the primary tumor followed by nivolumab; or C: intratumoral injection of IMO-2125 followed by percutaneous IRE of the primary tumor and nivolumab. Assessments include contrast enhanced computed tomography (ceCT), (18)F-FDG and (1)(8)F-BMS-986192 (PD-L1) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, biopsies of the primary tumor and metastases, peripheral blood samples, and quality of life and pain questionnaires. There is no curative treatment option for patients with mPDAC, and palliative chemotherapy regimens only moderately improve survival. Consequently, there is an urgent need for innovative and radically different treatment approaches. Should electroimmunotherapy establish an effective and durable anti-tumor response, it may ultimately improve PDAC's dismal prognosis.",2021,0,0,
204, Evaluation of shade correspondence between current monolithic CAD/CAM blocks and target shade tab by considering the influence of cement shade and restorative material thickness,"S. Ongun, Ö. Önöral and B. Günal-Abduljalil", Odontology," It was aimed to evaluate shade matching between novel CAD/CAM blocks and the A2 target shade tab by considering the influence of cement shade and restorative material thickness on the chromatic background. A total number of 120 rectangular-shaped specimens were subtracted from four different prefabricated CAD/CAM blocks [Vita Enamic (VE), Lava Ultimate (LU), GC Cerasmart (GC), and Vita Mark II (VMII)]. These specimens had thicknesses of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm. Three different shades (A2, opaque, and translucent) of dual-polymerized resin cement were chosen. The dentin shade (A3.5) restorative composite foundation was incrementally fabricated in a silicon mold. For control group, the A2 shade tab of the Vitapan classical shade guide was used. Different restorative material-cement-foundation assemblies were generated with optic gel. Color readings were performed by using a clinical spectrophotometer, and CIEDE2000 (ΔE(00)) formula was used to assess color differences. Data were statistically analyzed (α = 0.05). With increasing thickness, color difference values decreased. Higher mean ΔE(00) units were observed in all restorative material sub-groups for 0.5 mm thickness. In TR shade, no statistically significant difference was detected among the mean ΔE(00) values of 0.5 mm-thick restorative materials. Color differences in groups 1.0 mm-opaque-LU and 1.0 mm-opaque-GC indicated perceptible but clinically acceptable values (0.8˂ΔE(00) ≤ 1.8). The highest and lowest ΔE(00) units were observed in the 0.5 mm-A2-VE group (ΔE(00) = 7.07) and 1 mm-opaque-GC group (ΔE(00) = 1.46), respectively. Luting cement shade, restorative material type, and thickness significantly influenced the resultant color of restoration. Opaque cement on dentin foundation exhibited lower color differences.",2021,0,0,

Stevenson", Microb Ecol," Little is understood regarding the phylogeny and metabolic capabilities of the earliest colonists of volcanic rocks, yet these data are essential for understanding how life becomes established in and interacts with the planetary crust, ultimately contributing to critical zone processes and soil formation. Here, we report the use of molecular and culture-dependent methods to determine the composition of pioneer microbial communities colonising the basaltic Fimmvörðuháls lava flow at Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland, formed in 2010. Our data show that 3 to 5 months post eruption, the lava was colonised by a low-diversity microbial community dominated by Betaproteobacteria, primarily taxa related to non-phototrophic diazotrophs such as Herbaspirillum spp. and chemolithotrophs such as Thiobacillus. Although successfully cultured following enrichment, phototrophs were not abundant members of the Fimmvörðuháls communities, as revealed by molecular analysis, and phototrophy is therefore not likely to be a dominant biogeochemical process in these early successional basalt communities. These results contrast with older Icelandic lava of comparable mineralogy, in which phototrophs comprised a significant fraction of microbial communities, and the non-phototrophic community fractions were dominated by Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria.",2014,0,0,

Bonfante", Oper Dent," New resin-based restorative materials have been developed, such as computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and bulk-fill composites, as an alternative to traditional layering techniques. This study evaluated the biaxial flexural strength (BFS) before and after thermocycling of five different resin composites: one hybrid resin/ceramic CAD/CAM indirect material, Lava Ultimate CAD-CAM Restorative (LU, 3M Oral Care); a conventional composite, Filtek Z350 XT (Z350, 3M Oral Care); two bulk-fill composites, Tetric N-Ceram Bulk Fill (TBF, Ivoclar Vivadent) and Filtek Bulk Fill (FBF, 3M Oral Care); and one bulk-fill flow resin composite, Filtek Bulk Fill Flow (FBFF, 3M Oral Care). Three hundred disc-shaped specimens (6.5 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm thick) were fabricated and divided into five groups (n=30 for each composite and condition). The BFS test was performed in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min immediately (i, 24 hours) and after thermocycling (a, 500 thermal cycles of 5°C to 55°C with a 30-second dwell time). The Weibull modulus (m) and characteristic stress (η) were calculated, and a contour plot was used (m vs η) to detect differences between groups (95% two-sided confidence intervals). Significantly higher characteristic stress was observed for LUi (286.6 MPa) and Z350i (248.8 MPa) compared to the bulk-fill groups (FBFi=187.9 MPa, FBFFi=175.9 MPa, TBFi=149.9 MPa), with no differences between LUi and Z350i. Thermocycling significantly decreased the characteristic stress of all groups with the highest values observed for LUa (186.7 MPa) and Z350a (188.9 MPa) and the lowest for FBFFa (90.3 MPa). Intermediate values were observed for FBFa (151.6 MPa) and TBFa (122.8 MPa). The Weibull modulus decreased only for FBFa compared to FBFi. Composition and thermocycling significantly influenced the biaxial flexural strength of resin composite materials.",2019,1,1,

Derelioglu, Biomed Res Int," Objective. The aim of this study was to compare to fracture resistance test of inlay restorations prepared using direct inlay technique (Gradia® Direct Composite) and Indirect Restoration System® (Gradia Indirect Composite) and CAD/CAD system (Vita Enamic® Block). Study Design. 48 noncarious extracted maxillary second primary molars were randomly divided into 4 groups with 12 in each group. All the teeth were prepared based on inlay class II preparations except for the control group. Other groups were restored with Gradia Direct Composite, Gradia Indirect Composite, and Vita Enamic Block, respectively. All restorations were cemented self-adhesive dual cure resin (3M Espe, RelyX™ Unicem Aplicap). A fracture test was performed using a compressive load. Results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Duncan's post hoc multiple comparison tests (α = 0.05). Results. Vita Enamic Block and Gradia Indirect Composite showed significantly higher fracture resistance than Gradia Direct Composite (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference fracture resistance between Vita Enamic Block and Gradia Indirect Composite (p > 0.05). All restorations tested led to a significant reduction in fracture resistance (p < 0.05). Conclusion. In inlay restorations, Indirect Restoration Systems and CAD/CAM systems were applied successfully together with the self-adhesive dual cure resin cements in primary molars.",2016,0,1,
60, Chairside CAD/CAM materials. Part 1: Measurement of elastic constants and microstructural characterization,"R. Belli, M. Wendler, D. de Ligny, M. R. Cicconi, A. Petschelt, H. Peterlik and U. Lohbauer", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: A deeper understanding of the mechanical behavior of dental restorative materials requires an insight into the materials elastic constants and microstructure. Here we aim to use complementary methodologies to thoroughly characterize chairside CAD/CAM materials and discuss the benefits and limitations of different analytical strategies. METHODS: Eight commercial CAM/CAM materials, ranging from polycrystalline zirconia (e.max ZirCAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent), reinforced glasses (Vitablocs Mark II, VITA; Empress CAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent) and glass-ceramics (e.max CAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent; Suprinity, VITA; Celtra Duo, Dentsply) to hybrid materials (Enamic, VITA; Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE) have been selected. Elastic constants were evaluated using three methods: Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS), Resonant Beam Technique (RBT) and Ultrasonic Pulse-Echo (PE). The microstructures were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Raman Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). RESULTS: Young's modulus (E), Shear modulus (G), Bulk modulus (B) and Poisson's ratio (ν) were obtained for each material. E and ν reached values ranging from 10.9 (Lava Ultimate) to 201.4 (e.max ZirCAD) and 0.173 (Empress CAD) to 0.47 (Lava Ultimate), respectively. RUS showed to be the most complex and reliable method, while the PE method the easiest to perform but most unreliable. All dynamic methods have shown limitations in measuring the elastic constants of materials showing high damping behavior (hybrid materials). SEM images, Raman spectra and XRD patterns were made available for each material, showing to be complementary tools in the characterization of their crystal phases. SIGNIFICANCE: Here different methodologies are compared for the measurement of elastic constants and microstructural characterization of CAD/CAM restorative materials. The elastic properties and crystal phases of eight materials are herein fully characterized.",2017,0,0,
400," Optical properties of bisacryl-, composite-, ceramic- resin restorative materials: An aging simulation study","T. A. Sulaiman, A. A. Suliman, E. A. Mohamed, B. Rodgers, A. Altak and W. M. Johnston", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: Compare optical properties of a bisacryl-, composite-, and ceramic-resin restorative materials pre and post artificial aging. METHODS: Bisacryl-resin (LuxaCrown [LC], DMG), resin-composite (Filtek Supreme Ultra, [Filtek SU] 3M ESPE), and ceramic-resin (Enamic, VITA Zahnfabrik) specimens were prepared. The L*, C*(ab) , and h(ab) values were measured pre and post artificial aging to determine color stability (CIEDE2000) and changes in contrast ratio (CR), transmittance block, and relative translucency parameter. The datasets were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Color difference data showed a significant interaction between materials and treatments [F(6:60) = 375.04, P < .0001] with Enamic being most color stable material and coffee having most effect on color stability. CR data showed a significant interaction between materials and treatments [F(6:60) = 4.12, P = .0016]. LC showing most change in CR values with coffee treatment. Change in transmittance blocked by Filtek SU and LC was greater for coffee treatment than that by each of the other treatments (P < .0001). Filtek SU and LC, coffee produced a greater decrease in relative translucency than that each of the other treatments (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Resin-based materials demonstrate optical properties that encourage their use for direct/indirect restorative options. Color stability and translucency of these materials are proportionally related. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the optical properties of resin-based materials provides help in material selection and provides insight into clinical performance and esthetic longevity. The optical stability of certain bisacryl-resin is better than what was previously determined for these restorative materials.",2020,1,0,
524, Uniaxial/biaxial flexure strengths and elastic properties of resin-composite block materials for CAD/CAM,"B. J. Choi, S. Yoon, Y. W. Im, J. H. Lee, H. J. Jung and H. H. Lee", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: Comparing strengths under different loading conditions provides useful information on the mechanical behaviour of restorative materials under multiaxial masticatory loading in the oral cavity. The aims of this study was to investigate the flexural strengths and the reliability of resin-composite blocks for CAD/CAM by uniaxial and biaxial flexure tests and to compare the elastic properties measured by different methods including digital image correlation (DIC). METHODS: Four resin-composite blocks for CAD/CAM, namely, VE (Vita Enamic), LU (Lava Ultimate), MD (Mazic Duro), and CS (Cerasmart), were investigated. Beam specimens (4.0×1.4×18.0mm(3)) and disks (12-14mmϕ×1.5mm) were prepared to determine the uniaxial (three-point bending) and biaxial (ball-on-ring, BOR) flexural strengths and flexural moduli. A compression test (8×4×18mm(3)) with DIC analysis was utilized to measure the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio. Data were analysed by a 2-parameter Weibull function and ANOVA with Scheffe's test. RESULTS: The mean uniaxial and biaxial strengths and Weibull moduli of the specimen groups were as follows: uniaxial VE (140.1±7.0, 24.1), LU (159.1±6.3, 31.5), MD (144.9±13.3, 13.6), and CS (165.4±16.9, 11.2) and biaxial VE (153.6±10.4, 19.0), LU (231.0±29.3, 9.7), MD (148.9±23.8, 7.4), and CS (249.7±22.4, 13.8). Although the ranking of both sets of strength data remained unchanged, the strength reliability was significantly affected by the loading; the Weibull moduli of the specimens decreased when they were subjected to biaxial tests (except for that of CS). The elastic modulus values of the materials varied significantly under the different test loadings, although they were in the same order regardless of the test method: VE>>LU≈MD>CS. The DIC technique yielded elastic moduli that were in good agreement with those measured by the uniaxial flexure test. SIGNIFICANCE: The flexural strength, reliability, and elastic modulus of resin-composite block materials differed with the uniaxial and biaxial flexural loading and the test method. The different behaviours under both loadings should be considered in the evaluation of the mechanical performance of those materials.",2019,0,1,
156, Effect of Simulated Mastication on the Surface Roughness and Wear of Machinable Ceramics and Opposing Dental Enamel,"G. Daryakenari, H. Alaghehmand and A. Bijani", Oper Dent," OBJECTIVE: Computer aided design-computer aided machining (CAD-CAM) ceramic crowns are replacing ceramo-metal ones due to newly developed mechanical properties and esthetics. To obtain knowledge about their interactions due to polishing and occlusal contacts with the opposing dental enamel specimen, including surface roughness and wear, the three-body wear simulation was investigated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The surface roughness (RA) and wear rate (mm) of four CAD-CAM blocks with different compositions including Vita Mark II, e.max, Suprinity, and Enamic, after two surface treatments of glazing and polishing, and their opposing enamel specimens, were investigated using a mastication simulator and atomic force microscope. RESULTS: The roughness of all ceramic and to a greater extent enamel samples, with the exception of enamel opposing polished Enamic samples, was decreased after wear. No significant difference in wear was evident for the ceramic samples between the glazed and polished treatments. Lower wear rates were recorded only for polished Vita Mark II and polished Enamic in comparison to the glazed ones. CONCLUSION: The newly developed polishing systems for CAD-CAM ceramics can be good alternatives to reglazing, because the roughness and wear rate of both the ceramic and the opposing enamel will either not change or decrease.",2019,1,0,
55, Can CAD/CAM resin blocks be considered as substitute for conventional resins?,"B. Hussain, M. K. L. Thieu, G. F. Johnsen, J. E. Reseland and H. J. Haugen", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: Dentists are facing a myriad of new CAD/CAM product for dental filling therapies. Are the new materials any worthwhile using? Are they succeeding the standard filling materials? Here we compare for the first time the new resin-composite blocks (RCBs) with conventional materials (Filtek Z250 and Tetric EvoCeram). METHODS: The material were tested for residual monomer elution by HPLC, thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was used to determine the percentage of fillers by weight, hardness was evaluated by Vickers method, morphology of fillers and distribution in the matrix were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis for elemental determination of the filler particles was performed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) cytotoxicity using human gingival fibroblasts and an epithelial cell line. RESULTS: The RBC outperformed conventional composite regarding mechanical characteristics (hardness) and monomer eluation, but showed some worrisome results regarding cytotoxicity. SIGNIFICANCE: The cost benefit is not in favour of RBCs in comparison to conventional composites, as the cytotoxicity was found higher for RBCs.",2017,0,1,
115, Effect of acid etching on tridimensional microstructure of etchable CAD/CAM materials,"F. Murillo-Gómez, R. G. Palma-Dibb and M. F. De Goes", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: Evaluate if etching protocols affect superficial/internal microstructural integrity of CAD/CAM ceramic materials. METHODS: Sixty blocks (3×3×3mm) of IPS/Empress-LEU, IPS/e.max-LDC (Ivoclar-Vivadent) and Enamic-PIC (VITA) were used. Lateral surfaces from each block were isolated with Teflon strip and petroleum jelly to keep them untouched. Specimens were distributed into 6 groups (n=10): 1. no treatment (C); 2. hydrofluoric acid (HF) 5%, 20s (HF5%20s); 3. HF5%60s; 4. HF10%20s; 5. HF10%60s; 6. Monobond Etch&Prime (MBEP). Surface roughness (Sa) and 3D profile were obtained using a confocal-laser-optical-microscope (LEXT OLS 4000, Olympus), while element ratios (Si/K for LEU and LDC; Si/C for PIC) were recorded using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Superior (treated) and lateral (non-treated) surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM 5600 LV, JEOL). Etching depth was measured on lateral surfaces. Data were submitted to ANOVA-One-Way and Tukey test (α=0.05). RESULTS: For LEU, only HF10% treatments produced statistically different roughness values and Si/K ratios compared to C group. Regarding LDC and PIC, groups HF5%60s and HF10% showed higher roughness values than C group. In the case of PIC, all treatments (except MBEP) produced lower Si/C ratios than C group. All treatments (except MBEP) produced higher etching depth values than C group for all materials, being HF10%60s the highest (LEU:403.2±11.4μm; LDC:617.4±75.7; PIC:291.6±6.5μm). HF10% produced more aggressive etching morphology patterns on superior and lateral surfaces (SEM). Treatments MBEP and HF5%20s, produced the least aggressive structural alterations. Acid etching produces superficial and internal alterations on ceramics' structural configuration. SIGNIFICANCE: Aggressive etching protocols of glass-ceramics may cause internal material loss, consequently, milder etching is recommended to treat those materials before adhesion procedures.",2018,1,0,
528, Wear Behavior of Ceramic CAD/CAM Crowns and Natural Antagonists,"E. A. Naumova, S. Schneider, W. H. Arnold and A. Piwowarczyk", Materials (Basel)," OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of wear behavior of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) crowns from various restorative materials and natural antagonists. METHOD: Full CAD/CAM crowns fabricated with nanoceramic resin (Lava Ultimate (LU)), a glass ceramic in a resin interpenetrating matrix (Vita Enamic (VE)) and a lithium silicate reinforced ceramic enriched with zirconia (Vita Suprinity (VS)) were cemented on human molars. The crown and antagonists were subjected to simulated chewing. 3D data sets, before and after the chewing simulation, were generated and matched. Occlusal surface roughness, vertical and volume loss of the crowns and antagonists were analyzed. RESULTS: Crown roughness was significantly different between the LU and VE groups after chewing simulation. Crown vertical loss differed in all groups. The highest crown volume loss was found in the LU group, and the lowest in the VE group. Comparisons between the LU and VE groups and the LU and VS groups were significantly different. The highest antagonist volume loss was reached in the VE group, the lowest was in the LU group. CONCLUSION: Roughness increased after chewing simulation. LU crowns are the most natural antagonist-friendly; these were the most susceptible to vertical and volume loss. Of the tested materials, the VE crowns are the most stable regarding occlusion.",2017,1,0,
449, Shade Stability of Polymer Infiltrated and Resin Nano Ceramic Crowns after Dynamic Chewing Simulation,M. Schürmann and C. Olms, Eur J Prosthodont Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the shade stability of polymer-infiltrated and resin nano ceramic crowns before and after artificial aging. METHOD: 40 identical crowns of each of the materials VITA Enamic (VE) and Lava Ultimate (LU) were manufactured. Half of the crowns went through a dynamic chewing simulation (CS) with thermocycling. Material subgroups: 1. VE, 2. VE/CS, 3. LU, 4. LU/CS (each n=20). These were divided into 4 groups (n=5) and distributed in usual stain solutions. The shade of each crown was measured occlusally and vestibularly before and after insertion using a spectrophotometer (n=5). The data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test (p≤0.05). RESULTS: Sum scores (SSC) of the occlusal ΔE values: LU/CS: 7.99, VE: 5.75 VE/CS: 5.44, LU: 5.17. The total sum of the SSC yielded, for the materials: SSCtotal(VE): 20.0 and SSCtotal(LU): 24.0. SIGNIFICANCE: Occlusally, there were significant shade differences for VE/CS (p=0.025) and LU/CS (p=0.014) between red wine and distilled water. LU/CS is significantly more clearly stained occlusally by coffee in comparison to the other three material subgroups (VE: p=0.007, LU: p=0.026, VE/CS: p=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The shade stability of VITA Enamic crowns is superior to that of Lava Ultimate crowns. Only Lava Ultimate is affected by chewing simulation.",2018,1,0,
265, How will surface conditioning methods influence the translucency and color properties of CAD-CAM resin-matrix ceramics with different thicknesses?,"B. Günal Abduljalil, S. Ongun and Ö. Önöral", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: It was aimed to evaluate the effect of various surface-conditioning methods on the translucency and color properties of resin-matrix ceramics (RMCs) with different types and thicknesses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rectangle-shaped RMCs were prepared from Voco Grandio, Brilliant Crios, Lava Ultimate, GC Cerasmart, and Vita Enamic blocks at 0.5 and 1.0 mm thicknesses. Specimens were divided into four groups: control, airborne-particle abrasion (APA), 2 and 3 W Er, Cr:YSGG laser irradiations (L(2W) , L(3W) ) (n = 15). The color values of specimens were recorded before and after surface-conditioning using a spectrophotometer. The translucency parameter (RTP(00) ) and color difference (ΔE(00) ) values were calculated. Data were statistically analyzed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests. RESULTS: The translucencies of RMCs decreased after all surface-conditioning procedures. L caused more decline in translucency of materials than APA. All ΔE(00) values were under the acceptability threshold except for APA-applied Voco Grandio at 0.5 mm. Differences in ΔE(00) values between APA and L(3W) groups were significant (P˂0.05); while differences between L(2W) and L(3W) groups were insignificant (P > .05). In all experimental groups, ΔE(00) values decreased with increasing thickness of RMCs. CONCLUSIONS: L and APA significantly affected the translucency and color properties of RMCs. APA was found more favorable than L. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Clinicians should carefully use surface conditioning methods, considering their impact on the optical characteristics of RMCs, especially when the restoration is thin.",2020,1,0,
460, Sliding contact wear and subsurface damage of CAD/CAM materials against zirconia,"M. Wendler, M. R. Kaizer, R. Belli, U. Lohbauer and Y. Zhang", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: Most previous work conducted on the wear behavior of dental materials has focused on wear rates and surface damage. There is, however, scarce information regarding the subsurface damage arising from sliding contact fatigue. The aim of this study was to elucidate the wear mechanisms and the subsurface damage generated during sliding contact fatigue in 5 contemporary CAD/CAM materials against a zirconia indenter. METHODS: Forty discs (Ø12mm, 1.55mm thick) were cut out of IPS e.max CAD (e.CAD), Suprinity PC (SUP), Enamic (ENA), Vitablocs Mark II (VMII) and Lava Ultimate (LU) blocks and mirror polished. After cementation onto a dentin-like composite, off-axis mouth-motion cycling was conducted with a spherical zirconia indenter (r=3.18mm) in water (200N load, 2Hz frequency) for 5 different cycling periods (10(2), 10(3), 10(4), 10(5), 10(6) cycles, n=8). Analysis of the wear scars was conducted using light-microscopy, scanning-electron-microscopy and optical profilometry. Subsurface damage was assessed using sagittal and transverse sections of the samples. RESULTS: Fatigue wear mechanisms predominated in glassy materials (e.CAD, SUP, VMII), accompanied by extensive subsurface damage, whereas abrasive wear mechanisms were responsible for the large wear craters in the resin composite (LU) with an absolute absence of subsurface fracture. A combination of both mechanisms was observed in the polymer-infiltrated reinforced-glass (ENA), displaying large wear craters and severe subsurface damage. SIGNIFICANCE: Well-controlled laboratory simulation can identify wear and subsurface damage susceptibility of various classes of restorative materials. Both wear and subsurface fracture are determining factors for the long-term success of restorations.",2020,0,0,
253," Fracture strength, failure type and Weibull characteristics of lithium disilicate and multiphase resin composite endocrowns under axial and lateral forces","M. M. Gresnigt, M. Özcan, M. L. van den Houten, L. Schipper and M. S. Cune", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: Multiphase resin composite materials have been advocated as an alternative to reinforced ceramics but limited information is available to date on their stability. This in vitro study evaluated the effect of axial and lateral forces on the strength of endocrowns made of Li2Si2O5 and multiphase resin composite. METHODS: Sound human molars (N=60, n=10 per group) were randomly divided into 6 groups: Group C: Control, no preparation or restoration; Group LI: Endocrown made of Li2Si2O5 (IPS e.max CAD) and Group LA: Endocrown made of multiphase resin composite material (Lava Ultimate). After decapitation and endodontic preparation, immediate dentin sealing was performed. Following CAD/CAM fabrication, their cementation surfaces were silica coated (CoJet System) and silanized (ESPE-Sil). Endocrowns were then adhesively cemented (Variolink II). All specimens were thermocycled (×10,000 cycles). While half of the specimens in each group were subjected to axial (C(A), LI(A), LA(A)), the other half was subjected to lateral static (C(L), LI(L), LA(L)) loading (1mm/min). Failure type and location after debonding/fracture were classified. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test (α=0.05). Two-parameter Weibull distribution values including the Weibull modulus, scale (m) and shape (0), values were calculated. RESULTS: Under axial loading, mean fracture strength (N) did not show significant difference between groups: LAA (2675±588)(a), LIA (2428±566)(a), CA (2151±672)(a) (p>0.05) and under lateral loading, LAL (838±169)(A) presented significantly lower mean values than those of other groups: CL (1499±418)(B), LIL (1118±173)(B) (p<0.05). Both endocrown materials and the control group were more vulnerable to lateral loading than axial loading. Under axial loading, Weibull distribution presented higher shape (0) for Groups LIA (5.35) and LAA (5.08) than that of the control (3.97) and under lateral loading LIL (7.5) showed higher shape (0) than those of other groups (4.69-6.46). After axial loading, failure types were mainly cohesive in the material and after lateral loading primarily adhesive between the material and dentin for both LI and LA, most of which were repairable. SIGNIFICANCE: Under axial loading, molars restored with endocrowns performed similar with both Li2Si2O5 and multiphase resin composite but the latter was less durable under lateral loading.",2016,0,1,
61, Chairside CAD/CAM materials. Part 2: Flexural strength testing,"M. Wendler, R. Belli, A. Petschelt, D. Mevec, W. Harrer, T. Lube, R. Danzer and U. Lohbauer", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: Strength is one of the preferred parameters used in dentistry for determining clinical indication of dental restoratives. However, small dimensions of CAD/CAM blocks limit reliable measurements with standardized uniaxial bending tests. The objective of this study was to introduce the ball-on-three-ball (B3B) biaxial strength test for dental for small CAD/CAM block in the context of the size effect on strength predicted by the Weibull theory. METHODS: Eight representative chairside CAD/CAM materials ranging from polycrystalline zirconia (e.max ZirCAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent), reinforced glasses (Vitablocs Mark II, VITA; Empress CAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent) and glass-ceramics (e.max CAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent; Suprinity, VITA; Celtra Duo, Dentsply) to hybrid materials (Enamic, VITA; Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE) have been selected. Specimens were prepared with highly polished surfaces in rectangular plate (12×12×1.2mm(3)) or round disc (Ø=12mm, thickness=1.2mm) geometries. Specimens were tested using the B3B assembly and the biaxial strength was determined using calculations derived from finite element analyses of the respective stress fields. Size effects on strength were determined based on results from 4-point-bending specimens. RESULTS: A good agreement was found between the biaxial strength results for the different geometries (plates vs. discs) using the B3B test. Strength values ranged from 110.9MPa (Vitablocs Mark II) to 1303.21MPa (e.max ZirCAD). The strength dependency on specimen size was demonstrated through the calculated effective volume/surface. SIGNIFICANCE: The B3B test has shown to be a reliable and simple method for determining the biaxial strength restorative materials supplied as small CAD/CAM blocks. A flexible solution was made available for the B3B test in the rectangular plate geometry.",2017,0,0,
359, Mechanical degradation of contemporary CAD/CAM resin composite materials after water ageing,"M. Wendler, A. Stenger, J. Ripper, E. Priewich, R. Belli and U. Lohbauer", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of water storage on the quasi-static properties and cyclic fatigue behavior of four contemporary CAD/CAM resin composite materials. METHODS: The CAD/CAM resin composites Grandio Blocs, Lava(TM) Ultimate, Cerasmart(TM) and Brilliant Crios, as well as the direct resin composite Grandio SO, were evaluated. Rectangular plates were cut from the blocks or fabricated using a silicon mold to obtain specimens for fracture toughness (K(Ic), n = 10), biaxial strength (σ(0), n = 30) and cyclic fatigue testing (n = 30). Half of the specimens was stored for 24 h in dry conditions and the other half was aged for 60 days in distilled water at 37 °C. K(Ic) was determined using the Compact-Tension (C(T)) method and σ(0) and cyclic fatigue were tested using the Ball-on-Three-Balls assembly. Additional disc-shaped specimens (n = 5) were produced to obtain water sorption curves of the materials. Weibull statistics and two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test were used for data assessment. RESULTS: The highest water sorption was observed for Lava(TM) Ultimate (42.6 μg/mm(3)), whereas Grandio SO displayed the lowest uptake (14 μg/mm(3)). A statistically significant drop in K(Ic) and σ(0) was measured for all materials after water storage, except for the σ(0) of Cerasmart(TM). Water ageing had a dissimilar effect on the cyclic fatigue behavior, increasing the slow crack growth susceptibility of Lava(TM) Ultimate, but decreasing it for Cerasmart(TM) and Brilliant Crios. SIGNIFICANCE: Contemporary CAD/CAM resin composites are susceptible to water driven degradative processes, although differences in filler content and resin matrix constitution play an important role in how it impacts their mechanical properties.",2021,0,1,
338, Load capacity of occlusal veneers of different restorative CAD/CAM materials under lateral static loading,"H. Zamzam, A. Olivares and A. Fok", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVE: The aim of this in vitro study was to analyze the failure of occlusal veneers made of three different restorative CAD/CAM materials under lateral static loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty standardized semi-anatomical occlusal veneers were fabricated on natural lower molars from three different CAD/CAM materials: hybrid ceramic (Vita Enamic), lithium disilicate (IPS e. max CAD) and translucent zirconia (Bruxzir). The specimens were mechanically loaded by a custom-made device attached to a universal testing machine (MTS 858 Mini Bionix II, MN, USA). Static lateral loading was applied on the buccal cusp of the occlusal veneer until failure. Failure loads were recorded, and the types of failure noted for each group. 3D finite element (FE) models simulating the actual test set-up were further employed to evaluate the stresses within the tooth-restoration complex to help interpret the experimental results. RESULTS: Occlusal veneers made from zirconia recorded a significantly higher mean failure load (843.1 ± 141.5 N) than specimens of the other two materials (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the lithium disilicate (493.21 ± 102.24 N) and the hybrid ceramic (499.6 ± 123.1 N) groups (p = 0.863). 74% of the hybrid ceramic and 84% of the lithium disilicate specimens showed veneer fracture, whereas 78% of the zirconia veneers showed debonding. Comparison of the FE-predicted stresses with the different failure strengths corroborated with the experimental results. CONCLUSION: Lateral loading caused failure of occlusal veneers at loads significantly lower than those reported for axial loading. Among the materials tested, zirconia veneers showed the highest resistance to failure, with the main failure mode being debonding under lateral loading. The other two material groups failed mainly by veneer fracture at lower loads. HIGHLIGHTS: - A novel device was used for testing occlusal veneers under lateral static loading. - 3D-FE analysis explained and corroborated the experimental results. - The relationship between vertical and horizontal forces acting on teeth has been described. - The study highlights the harm of excursive contacts on ceramic restorations.",2021,1,0,
85, Comparative Evaluation of Marginal Adaptation and Fracture Strength of Different Ceramic Inlays Produced by CEREC Omnicam and Heat-Pressed Technique,F. D. Oz and S. Bolay, Int J Dent," OBJECTIVE: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate marginal adaptation and fracture strength of inlays produced by CEREC Omnicam using different types of blocs and heat-pressed technique. Methods: Seventy-five extracted human mandibular molars were divided randomly into 5 groups (n=15). 60 molars in four groups received MOD inlay preparations. Experimental groups were CO: Intact teeth, EC: IPS e.max CAD and CEREC, LU: Lava Ultimate and CEREC, EL: IPS Empress CAD and CEREC, EP: IPS Empress Esthetic ingots and heat-pressed technique. Marginal gap measurements were taken with a stereomicroscope. Restorations were cemented with Variolink N and stored in distilled water at 37°C for 24 hours. All samples were subjected to thermocycling. The fracture strength of specimens was determined at a 0.5 mm/min crosshead speed until fracture. Fracture modes were determined. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance for fracture strength data and Kruskal-Wallis for marginal gap data (p=0.05). RESULTS: The mean marginal gap size of EC, LU, EL, and EP were 33.54 µm, 33.77 µm, 34.23 µm, and 85.34 µm, respectively. EP had statistically higher values than other groups. The fracture strength values were significantly higher in the intact teeth group (3959,00 ± 1279,79 N) than those of restored groups EC (2408,00 ± 607,97 N), LU (2206,73 ± 675,16), EL (2573.27 ± 644,73) ve EP (2879,53 ± 897,30). CONCLUSION: Inlays fabricated using CEREC Omnicam demonstrated better marginal adaptation than inlays produced with heat-pressed technique, whereas fracture strength values of inlays fabricated with different type of blocks using CEREC Omnicam exhibited similarity to those fabricated with heat-pressed technique.",2018,0,0,
413, Polymer-infiltrated ceramic CAD/CAM inlays and partial coverage restorations: 3-year results of a prospective clinical study over 5 years,"F. A. Spitznagel, K. J. Scholz, J. R. Strub, K. Vach and P. C. Gierthmuehlen", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective clinical 5-year study was to evaluate the long-term behavior of monolithic computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-fabricated minimally invasive polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) inlays and partial coverage restorations (PCR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Posterior teeth of 47 patients were restored with 103 restorations (45 inlays, 58 PCRs). After defect-oriented preparations, monolithic PICN restorations of VITA Enamic were fabricated with a CAD/CAM system (inEoS blue/CEREC inLab MCXL) and adhesively bonded (Variolink II). Clinical reevaluations were so far performed at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after insertion according to modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Absolute failures were demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier survival rate and relative failures by Kaplan-Meier success rate. A logistic regression model was adjusted for modified USPHS criteria to investigate time and restoration effects (p < 0.05). RESULTS: After an observation time of 3 years, survival rates were 97.4% for inlays and 95.6% for PCRs. Three restorations had to be replaced due to clinically unacceptable fractures. Secondary caries and debonding were not observed. The 3-year Kaplan-Meier success rate was 84.8% for inlays and 82.4% for PCRs. The decrease in marginal adaption (p = 0.0005), increase in marginal discoloration (p < 0.0001), and surface roughness (p = 0.0005) over time were significant. Color match and anatomic form were excellent. No significant differences were found between both types of restorations for survival (p = 0.716) and success rate (p = 0.431). CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive PICN restorations showed a favorable clinical performance over an observation period of 36 months. However, clinical long-term data have to be awaited. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PICN restorations are a suitable treatment option for posterior inlays and PCRs.",2018,1,0,
215, Fatigue behavior and crack initiation of CAD/CAM resin composite molar crowns,"S. Yamaguchi, R. Kani, K. Kawakami, M. Tsuji, S. Inoue, C. Lee, W. Kiba and S. Imazato", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term fatigue behavior using an in vitro step-stress accelerated life test (SSALT), and to determine the crack initiation point using in silico finite element analysis for computer-aided designed and manufactured (CAD/CAM) molar crowns fabricated from three commercial CAD/CAM resin composite blocks: Cerasmart (CS; GC, Tokyo, Japan), Katana Avencia Block (KA; Kuraray Noritake Dental, Niigata, Japan), and Shofu Block HC (HC; Shofu, Kyoto, Japan). METHODS: Fifty-one mandibular first molar crowns luted on a resin core die were embedded in acrylic resin and covered with a polyvinyl chloride tube. Single compressive tests were performed for five crowns. SSALT was conducted for 36 crowns using three profiles and reliabilities at 120,000 cycles, and a Weibull analysis was conducted. The maximum principal strain of each CAD/CAM resin composite crown model was analyzed by three-dimensional finite element analysis. RESULTS: Fracture loads of CS and KA (3784±144N and 3915±313N) were significantly greater than that of HC (2767±227N) (p<0.05). Fracture probabilities at 120,000 cycles were 24.6% (CS), 13.7% (KA), and 14.0% (HC). Maximum principal strain was observed around the mesiolingual cusps of CS and KA and the distobuccal cusp of HC. SIGNIFICANCE: CAD/CAM resin composite molar crowns containing nano-fillers with a higher fraction of resin matrix exhibited higher fracture loads and greater longevity, suggesting that these crowns could be used as an alternative to ceramic crowns in terms of fatigue behavior.",2018,0,1,
522, Two-year performance of CAD/CAM fabricated resin composite inlay restorations: A randomized controlled clinical trial,"A. T. Tunac, E. U. Celik and B. Yasa", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the 2-year clinical performance of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) resin composite inlay restorations in comparison with direct resin composite restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 44 patients, 120 class II (mesio-occlusal/disto-occlusal) cavities were randomly assigned into two groups; CAD/CAM resin composite inlay group (Lava Ultimate), direct resin composite group (Clearfil Majesty Posterior). Clinical evaluations were performed after 1 week, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years according to the FDI criteria. The data were analyzed using Friedman's ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U tests (α = .05). RESULTS: In 41 patients, 114 restorations were evaluated at the second year (recall rate 93.2%). All restorations were ideal or clinically acceptable. At the first year, considering all criteria, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. However, there was a significant difference in terms of surface luster at second year, in favor of inlay restorations (P = .015). The marginal staining of resin composites increased after 2 years (P = .046), but there was no significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Except the surface luster, 2-year clinical performance of CAD/CAM resin composite inlay restorations was found similar to direct resin composite restorations according to FDI criteria CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The clinical performance of CAD/CAM resin composite inlays was acceptable in class II cavities subsequent to 2-year evaluation.",2019,0,1,
344, Marginal adaptation and fracture resistance of feldspathic and polymer-infiltrated ceramic network CAD/CAM endocrowns for maxillary premolars,"G. Saglam, S. Cengiz and O. Karacaer", Niger J Clin Pract," OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the marginal adaptation and fracture resistance of feldspathic and Polymer-Infiltrated Ceramic Network (PICN) CAD/CAM endocrowns for maxillary premolars. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty extracted human permanent maxillary premolars were randomly divided into two groups (n = 10); Group CEREC (GC), which was produced by feldspathic ceramic and the Group Enamic (GE), which was produced by PICN. All teeth were endodontically treated and decoronated horizontally at 2 mm above the cemento-enamel junction. Endocrown preparations were done with 4 mm depth into the pulp chamber. Endocrowns were manufactured using CAD/CAM from ceramic blocks. Following adhesive cementation, all specimens were subjected to thermocycling. Marginal adaptation evaluated under SEM at 200 × magnification. Each specimen was fixed in a universal testing machine and a compressive load was applied at 45° to long axis of the teeth until failure. Failure load was recorded and failure modes were evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 19.0 software and data were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the marginal adaptation between two groups (P > 0.05). GE presented significantly higher fracture resistance when compared to GC (P < 0.05). Failure pattern was similar and characterized by the tooth-ceramic fracture on the force-applied side. CONCLUSIONS: CAD/CAM fabricated feldspathic ceramic and PICN endocrowns provide sufficient marginal adaptation, but the PICN endocrowns shows higher fracture resistance than the feldspathic ceramic endocrowns.",2020,1,0,
30, Aging behavior of high-translucent CAD/CAM resin-based composite blocks,V. M. Ducke and N. Ilie, J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of artificial aging on the mechanical properties and fracture patterns of novel CAD/CAM resin-based composite blocks (RCB). METHODS: Flexural strength and modulus of RCBs from seven manufacturers (Voco, Grandio Blocs, GB; Ivoclar Vivadent, Tetric®CAD, TC; DMG, Luxacam Composite, LC; Shofu Block HC, SF; 3M, Lava™ Ultimate, LU; GC, Cerasmart®, CS; Coltene, BRILLIANT Crios, CB) were assessed in a three-point-bending test after an aging process consisting of three sequential steps (14 days storage in artificial saliva, 10,000 thermo-cycles in distilled water between 5/55 °C, 48 h storage in ethanol 75%). Fracture origins were determined in a fractographic examination using reflected light stereomicroscopy combined with transillumination and scanning electron microscopy. Effects of aging were statistically analysed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post hoc test (α = 0.05) and Weibull statistics. Correlations regarding filler amount were analysed using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The strongest influence on the flexural modulus and strength was exerted based on the parameter material (p < 0.001, ɳ(P)(2) = 0.957; ɳ(P)(2) = 0.770), but the influence of in vitro aging was also significant (p < 0.001, ɳ(P)(2) = 0.623; ɳ(P)(2) = 0.407). Storage in artificial saliva decreased the flexural modulus and flexural strength of all materials, apart from CS, significantly (p < 0.05). The Weibull moduli varied from 5.8 to 22.4. Filler amount correlated significantly with flexural modulus (p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.739). Fractography revealed four different fracture patterns with fracture origins from the corner, edge or sub-surface and a smooth fracture surface with non-identifiable fracture origin. Specimens with smooth fracture surface showed the significantly lowest flexural strength (p < 0.001). Pores, agglomerates and inclusions were identified as fracture origins. CONCLUSIONS: Storage in artificial saliva mainly reduced the mechanical properties significantly while additional thermal aging mostly maintained the results. Aging in ethanol mostly maintained the results for flexural modulus but led to an increase in flexural strength values to the level of the unaged specimens. Fractographic analysis revealed a significant accumulation of sub-surface fracture origins after storage in ethanol arising from inherent flaws.",2021,0,1,
134, Effect of different preparation designs and all ceramic materials on fracture strength of molar endocrowns,"S. B. Haralur, A. A. Alamrey, S. A. Alshehri, D. S. Alzahrani and M. Alfarsi", J Appl Biomater Funct Mater," OBJECTIVE: The aim was to compare the fracture strength of Molar endocrowns fabricated from different all-ceramic materials and various preparation designs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety extracted human molar teeth were root canal treated and randomly divided into three groups according to the all ceramic materials used for fabrication of the endocrowns (n = 30): (1) Lithium disilicate (IPS e.max Press); (2) Polymer infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic); (3) High translucency zirconia (Ceramill Zolid HT). Each group was subdivided into 3 subgroups (n = 10) according to the preparation design as 2 mm occlusal reduction, 4.5 mm occlusal reduction, and 4.5 mm occlusal reduction with 2 mm radicular extension. The endocrowns from each material were fabricated and surface treated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After cementation with self-adhesive resin luting cement, the specimens were stored in a humid environment for 72 hours and subsequently subjected to 5000 thermal cycles. After, a compressive, static-axial load was applied using a universal testing machine until failure. Load-to-failure was recorded (N) and the specimens were examined under a stereomicroscope to determine the failure type. The data was statistically analyzed using One-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The Lithium Disilicate endocrowns recorded the higher mean fracture strength for 4.5 mm occlusal thickness and 2 mm radicular extension at 3770.28 N and 3877.40 correspondingly. The High translucency zirconia endocrowns at conventional 2 mm thickness showed the highest mean fracture load (3533.34 N). Even though polymer infiltrated ceramic endocrowns displayed comparatively lesser fracture load; they recorded the predominantly favorable fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Increased occlusal thickness showed a significant improvement in fracture strength of lithium disilicate and polymer infiltrated ceramic molar endocrowns. Although the 2 mm radicular extension had the substantial enhancement of fracture strength in high translucency zirconia, it resulted in more unfavorable failure types.",2020,1,0,
317, Influence of Short Fiber- Reinforced Composites on Fracture Resistance of Single-Structure Restorations,"E. Mangoush, S. Garoushi, P. K. Vallittu and L. Lassila", Eur J Prosthodont Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the load-bearing capacity of anterior crowns prepared using two types of single-structure short fibre-reinforced composites (SFRCs). Furthermore, fracture toughness (FT), flexural strength (FS) and flexural modulus (FM) of tested composites were measured. METHODS: Seven groups of composite crowns were designed for an upper central incisor (n=8/group). Two groups were CAD/CAM fabricated made of Cerasmart 270 and experimental single-structure SFRC blocks. Two groups were 3D-printed made of GC Temp PRINT and Pro3dure GR-17 composites. Two groups were made of conventional light-cured composites (Essentia and Gradia Plus). The last group was a single-structure SFRC made of commercial flowable SFRC (everX Flow). Crown restorations were loaded until fracture. Failure-modes were then visually examined. FT, FS and FM were determined for each tested composite (n=8). The data were analysed using analysis of variance (p=0.05) followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed that crowns made of experimental SFRC blocks had significantly higher load-bearing capacities (1650 ±230 N) (p⟨0.05) among all the groups tested. Experimental SFRC blocks exhibited the highest FT (2.9 MPa m1/2) and FS (245.8 MPa) values (p⟨0.05) among tested composites. CONCLUSION: CAD/CAM fabricated restorations made of experimental SFRC blocks demonstrated encouraging performance related to their fracture-behaviour.",2020,0,1,

Kaczmarek", J Healthc Eng," OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the flexural strength, flexural modulus, microhardness, Weibull modulus, and characteristic strength of six resin composite blocks (Grandio Blocs-GR, Tetric CAD-TE, Brilliant Crios-CR, Katana Avencia-AV, Cerasmart-CS, and Shofu Block HC-HC). METHODS: Flexural strength and flexural modulus were measured using a three-point bending test and microhardness using the Vickers method. Weibull analysis was also performed. RESULTS: The materials showed flexural strength ranging from 120.38 (HC) to 186.02 MPa (GR), flexural modulus from 8.26 (HC) to 16.95 GPa (GR), and microhardness from 70.85 (AV) to 140.43 (GR). Weibull modulus and characteristic strength ranged from 16.35 (CS) to 34.98 (TE) and from 123.45 MPa (HC) to 190.3 MPa (GR), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: GR, TE, and CR presented significantly higher flexural strength, modulus, Weibull modulus, and characteristic strength than the others.",2021,0,1,
375, Microstructure and Surface Characteristics of Short- Fiber Reinforced CAD/CAM Composite Blocks,"E. Mangoush, L. Lassila, P. K. Vallittu and S. Garoushi", Eur J Prosthodont Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate certain surface properties and microstructure of an experimental short fiber-reinforced CAD/CAM composite block (SFRC) in comparison with different CAD/CAM, 3D-printing and manually-made commercial composites (Cerasmart 270, GC Temp PRINT, Pro3dure GR-17, Essentia U, Gradia Plus and everX Flow). METHODS: A wear-test was performed using a chewing-simulator with 15000 cycles. Wear depth (n=6) was assessed by 3D optical-profilometer. Surface roughness (SR) before and after wearing-test was evaluated. A Vickers-indenter was utilized for evaluating surface microhardness (VH) and glossmeter was utilized to measure the surface gloss at 60°. The surface microstructure of each composite was investigated with SEM. Data were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance ANOVA (p=0.05). RESULTS: Significant differences in the surface properties were found according to the type of composite (p⟨0.05). Cerasmart 270 exhibited the highest VH (94.8 V) and lowest SR (0.18 Ra) values (p⟨0.05) among the composites tested. The lowest wear depth measurement was located for GC Temp PRINT (19.3 μm) which was not significantly different (p⟩0.05) from Cerasmart 270 (20.7 μm). CONCLUSION: Incorporation of fibers to the composite of the CAD/CAM block did not negatively influence the surface characteristics of composite.",2021,0,1,
226, Fatigue resistance of ultrathin CAD/CAM ceramic and nanoceramic composite occlusal veneers,"K. Heck, H. Paterno, A. Lederer, F. Litzenburger, R. Hickel and K. H. Kunzelmann", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: The fracture resistance of different ultrathin occlusal computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) veneers was investigated under cyclic mechanical loading to restore combined enamel-dentin defects. METHODS: Eighty-four molars were reduced occlusally until extensive dentin exposure occurred with a remaining enamel ring. Twenty-four molars were ground flat for examination of highly standardized specimens, of which 8 were treated with uniformly flat 0.3mm IPS Empress CAD and 0.3 and 0.5mm IPS e.max CAD restorations. Sixty-four molars were anatomically prepared until dentin exposure and were restored using occlusal veneers with fissure/cusp thicknesses of 0.3/0.5mm from 3 different dental CAD/CAM materials: IPS Empress CAD, IPS e.max CAD and Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM. Teeth were etched with 37% phosphoric acid, and occlusal veneers were bonded using an adhesive luting system (Syntac Primer, Adhesive, Heliobond and Variolink II). Specimens were placed under cyclic mechanical loading in a chewing simulator (1 million cycles at 50N) and were examined for cracks after each cyclic loading sequence. The anatomical 0.3/0.5mm IPS e.max CAD specimens experienced an additional 1 million cycles at 100N. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used for data analysis. RESULTS: All highly standardized and 0.3/0.5mm IPS e.max CAD specimens tolerated cyclic loading. One anatomical Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM and 10 IPS Empress CAD specimens showed cracks. SIGNIFICANCE: Ultrathin occlusal veneers of lithium disilicate ceramic and nanoceramic composite showed remarkably high fracture strength under cyclic mechanical loading. These veneers might be a tooth substance preserving option for restoring combined dentin-enamel defects.",2019,1,1,
399, Optical integration of CAD/CAM materials,J. F. Güth and P. Magne, Int J Esthet Dent," OBJECTIVE: The optical integration (OI) of monolithic CAD/CAM materials under 4 illuminations was evaluated using a standardized and clinically relevant method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen inlays were manufactured and placed (glycerin gel). Standardized photos were taken under 4 illuminations (neutral white light direct and indirect illumination, cross-polarized light, fluorescent light). Six evaluators defined the optical integration score (OIS) as the ""visibility"" of the restoration (0 = worst OI, 4 = optimal OI). The intact tooth served as control. The null hypothesis was that different illuminations did not influence the OI of CAD/CAM inlays. One-way ANOVA, followed by Scheffe's post hoc, was applied (P = 0.05). RESULTS: Neutral light direct illumination: OIS between 2.67 (IPS e.max CAD LT A1, ENAMIC A1) and 3.83 (IPS e.max CAD HT A1) with a mean of 3.28 (± 0.339). Indirect illumination: OIS from 1.00 (Paradigm MZ100 A1) to 2.41 (ENAMIC A1) with a mean of 1.88 (± 0.598). Fluorescent light: OIS between 0.75 and 3.25 with a mean of 1.67 (± 1.025). ENAMIC and VITA BLOCS Mark II showed the best optical integration in fluorescence. IPS e.max CAD, Paradigm MZ 100 demonstrated low fluorescence; Lava Ultimate high fluorescence. OI was influenced by different illumination. CONCLUSION: A simple method accessible to clinicians for additional evaluation of CAD/CAM materials in daily practice is presented. All materials showed excellent OI under direct illumination with neutral white light. The most pronounced differences in optical integration between tooth and evaluated materials were observed under fluorescent light.",2016,0,0,
106, Do resin-based composite CAD/CAM blocks release monomers?,"K. Barutcigil, A. Dündar, S. G. Batmaz, K. Yıldırım and Ç. Barutçugil", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to identify and quantify the elution of monomers of five different resin-based CAD/CAM blocks (RCBs) using HPLC. METHODS: Five different RCBs were used in the study: GC Cerasmart (CS), Voco Grandio blocs (GR), 3M Lava Ultimate (LU), Shofu Block (SB), and Vita Enamic (VE). Fifteen samples from each material were prepared using a low-speed precision diamond saw (ISOMET Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) at 5 × 5 × 4 mm size. After the preparation of samples, an extraction solution was mixed with %75/%25 ethanol/water. The samples were stored in the amber-colored bottles during three different immersed periods as 1 h, 24 h, and 90 days (n = 5). After immersion, 0.5 ml solutions were taken from each bottle and analyzed using HPLC. RESULTS: A total of 16.7 μg/ml of monomers from SB, 13.4 μg/ml of monomers from GR, 13.2 μg/ml of monomers from CS, and 6.7 μg/ml of monomers from LU were found after 3-m immersion. TEGDMA after 3-m of immersion was only released from the SB group, and also BisEMA was released from the CS group. Among the specimens immersed for 1 h, UDMA was released the least from the LU group and the most from the GR group (p < 0.05). Correspondingly, 24 h and 3 m after immersion, the highest release of monomers was found in the GR (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: When the monomer release from RCBs was evaluated, it was shown that these materials released methacrylate-based monomers except VE, especially if they were kept in a solvent solution for a long time such as 3 m. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The novel resin-based CAD/CAM blocks might monomer release, which may cause cytotoxic effects. But, the detected amount of monomer release is below the estimated daily limit.",2021,0,0,
202, Evaluation of Polishing Systems for CAD/CAM Polymer-Infiltrated Ceramic-Network Restorations,"C. A. Jurado, A. Tsujimoto, H. Watanabe, N. G. Fischer, J. A. Hasslen, H. Tomeh, A. G. Baruth, W. W. Barkmeier and F. Garcia-Godoy", Oper Dent," OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of five different polishing systems on a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network restoration with nanoscale assessment using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and visual assessment performed by dental school senior students and faculty members. METHOD: Forty-eight full coverage crowns were milled out of polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network CAD/CAM blocks (Vita Enamic) for polishing with one company proprietary, two ceramic and two composite polishing systems. The prepared crowns were divided into six groups: (1) no polishing (control); (2) polishing with Vita Enamic Polishing Kit (VEna); (3) polishing with Shofu Porcelain Laminate Polishing Kit (SCer); (4) polishing with Brasseler Dialite Feather lite All- Ceramic Adjusting & Polishing System (BCer); (5) polishing with Shofu Composite Polishing Kit (SCom); and (6) polishing with Brasseler Composite Polishing Kit (BCom). The polished crown surface topography was observed, and surface roughness and area were measured with AFM. In addition, polished crowns were visually assessed by 15 senior dental students and 15 dental school faculty members. RESULTS: All polishing treatments significantly reduced the surface roughness and area of the crown compared with the control. SCom and BCom showed significantly higher surface area than VEna, and the SCer and BCer groups were intermediate, showing no significant difference from either VEna or SCom and BCom. There were no significant differences in surface roughness between any of the systems. Dental students and faculty members classified the groups polished with VEna, SCer, and BCer groups as clinically acceptable, and they selected BCer group as the best polished restorations and the control group as the least polished restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Ceramic and composite polishing systems produced similar polishing results as that observed using a company proprietary polishing system. However, effectiveness for polishing using a company proprietary and ceramic polishing system tends to be higher than composite polishing systems.",2021,1,0,
322, Influence of Thermal Cycling on Flexural Properties and Simulated Wear of Computer-aided Design/Computer-aided Manufacturing Resin Composites,"A. Tsujimoto, W. W. Barkmeier, T. Takamizawa, M. A. Latta and M. Miyazaki", Oper Dent," OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of thermal cycling on the flexural properties and simulated wear of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) resin composites. METHODS: The six CAD/CAM resin composites used in this study were 1) Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM Restorative (LU); 2) Paradigm MZ100 (PM); 3) CERASMART (CS); 4) Shofu Block HC (SB); 5) KATANA AVENCIA Block (KA); and 6) VITA ENAMIC (VE). Specimens were divided randomly into two groups, one of which was stored in distilled water for 24 hours, and the other of which was subjected to 10,000 thermal cycles. For each material, 15 specimens from each group were used to determine the flexural strength and modulus according to ISO 6872, and 20 specimens from each group were used to examine wear using a localized wear simulation model. The test materials were subjected to a wear challenge of 400,000 cycles in a Leinfelder-Suzuki device (Alabama machine). The materials were placed in custom-cylinder stainless steel fixtures, and simulated localized wear was generated using a stainless steel ball bearing (r=2.387 mm) antagonist in a water slurry of polymethyl methacrylate beads. Simulated wear was determined using a noncontact profilometer (Proscan 2100) with Proscan and AnSur 3D software. RESULTS: The two-way analysis of variance of flexural properties and simulated wear of CAD/CAM resin composites revealed that material type and thermal cycling had a significant influence (p<0.05), but there was no significant interaction (p>0.05) between the two factors. The flexural properties and maximum depth of wear facets of CAD/CAM resin composite were different (p<0.05) depending on the material, and their values were influenced (p>0.05) by thermal cycling, except in the case of VE. The volume losses in wear facets on LU, PM, and SB after 10,000 thermal cycles were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those after 24 hours of water storage, unlike CS, KA, and VE. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the flexural properties and simulated wear of CAD/CAM resin composites are different depending on the material. In addition, the flexural properties and simulated wear of CAD/CAM resin composites are influenced by thermal cycling.",2017,0,1,
284, In vitro Fracture strength and hardness of different computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing inlays,"O. Sagsoz, M. Yildiz, A. S. L. Hojjat Ghahramanzadeh and A. Alsaran", Niger J Clin Pract," OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the fracture strength and surface microhardness of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mesial-occlusal-distal inlays were made from five different CAD/CAM materials (feldspathic ceramic, CEREC blocs; leucite-reinforced ceramic, IPS Empress CAD; resin nano ceramic, 3M ESPE Lava Ultimate; hybrid ceramic, VITA Enamic; and lithium disilicate ceramic, IPS e.max CAD) using CEREC 4 CAD/CAM system. Samples were adhesively cemented to metal analogs with a resin cement (3M ESPE, U200). The fracture tests were carried out with a universal testing machine. Furthermore, five samples were prepared from each CAD/CAM material for micro-Vickers hardness test. Data were analyzed with statistics software SPSS 20 (IBM Corp., New York, USA). RESULTS: Fracture strength of lithium disilicate inlays (3949 N) was found to be higher than other ceramic inlays (P < 0.05). There was no difference between other inlays statistically (P > 0.05). The highest micro-Vickers hardness was measured in lithium disilicate samples, and the lowest was in resin nano ceramic samples. CONCLUSION: Fracture strength results demonstrate that inlays can withstand the forces in the mouth. Statistical results showed that fracture strength and micro-Vickers hardness of feldspathic ceramic, leucite-reinforced ceramic, and lithium disilicate ceramic materials had a positive correlation.",2018,1,0,
431, Repairability of CAD/CAM high-density PMMA- and composite-based polymers,"A. Wiegand, L. Stucki, R. Hoffmann, T. Attin and B. Stawarczyk", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to analyse the shear bond strength of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)- and composite-based polymer materials repaired with a conventional methacrylate-based composite after different surface pretreatments. METHODS: Each 48 specimens was prepared from six different CAD/CAM polymer materials (Ambarino high-class, artBloc Temp, CAD-Temp, Lava Ultimate, Telio CAD, Everest C-Temp) and a conventional dimethacrylate-based composite (Filtek Supreme XTE, control) and aged by thermal cycling (5000 cycles, 5-55 °C). The surfaces were left untreated or were pretreated by mechanical roughening, aluminium oxide air abrasion or silica coating/silanization (each subgroup n = 12). The surfaces were further conditioned with an etch&rinse adhesive (OptiBond FL) before the repair composite (Filtek Supreme XTE) was adhered to the surface. After further thermal cycling, shear bond strength was tested, and failure modes were assessed. Shear bond strength was statistically analysed by two- and one-way ANOVAs and Weibull statistics, failure mode by chi(2) test (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Shear bond strength was highest for silica coating/silanization > aluminium oxide air abrasion = mechanical roughening > no surface pretreatment. Independently of the repair pretreatment, highest bond strength values were observed in the control group and for the composite-based Everest C-Temp and Ambarino high-class, while PMMA-based materials (artBloc Temp, CAD-Temp and Telio CAD) presented significantly lowest values. For all materials, repair without any surface pretreatment resulted in adhesive failures only, which mostly were reduced when surface pretreatment was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of CAD/CAM high-density polymers requires surface pretreatment prior to adhesive and composite application. However, four out of six of the tested CAD/CAM materials did not achieve the repair bond strength of a conventional dimethacrylate-based composite. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Repair of PMMA- and composite-based polymers can be achieved by surface pretreatment followed by application of an adhesive and a conventional methacrylate-based composite.",2015,0,1,
180, Effects of air abrasion with alumina or glass beads on surface characteristics of CAD/CAM composite materials and the bond strength of resin cements,"A. Nobuaki, Y. Keiichi and S. Takashi", J Appl Oral Sci," OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate effects of air abrasion with alumina or glass beads on bond strengths of resin cements to CAD/CAM composite materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CAD/CAM composite block materials [Cerasmart (CS) and Block HC (BHC)] were pretreated as follows: (a) no treatment (None), (b) application of a ceramic primer (CP), (c) alumina-blasting at 0.2 MPa (AB), (d) AB followed by CP (AB+CP), and (e) glass-beads blasting at 0.4 MPa (GBB) followed by CP (GBB+CP). The composite specimens were bonded to resin composite disks using resin cements [G-CEM Cerasmart (GCCS) and ResiCem (RC)]. The bond strengths after 24 h (TC 0) and after thermal cycling (TC 10,000 at 4-60°C) were measured by shear tests. Three-way ANOVA and the Tukey compromise post hoc tests were used to analyze statistically significant differences between groups (α=0.05). RESULTS: For both CAD/CAM composite materials, the None group exhibited a significant decrease in bond strength after TC 10,000 (p<0.05). AB showed significantly higher bond strength after TC 10,000 than the None group, while CP did not (p<0.05). GBB exhibited smaller surface defects than did AB; however, their surface roughnesses were not significantly different (p>0.05). The AB+CP group showed a significantly higher bond strength after TC 10,000 than did the AB group for RC (p<0.05), but not for GCCS. The GBB+CP group showed the highest bond strength for both thermal cyclings (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Air abrasion with glass beads was more effective in increasing bond durability between the resin cements and CAD/CAM composite materials than was using an alumina powder and a CP.",2015,0,1,
35, Assessment of marginal adaptation and fracture resistance of endocrown restorations utilizing different machinable blocks subjected to thermomechanical aging,"D. Taha, S. Spintzyk, A. Sabet, M. Wahsh and T. Salah", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study was conducted to assess the marginal adaptation and fracture resistance of computer aided design/computer aided manufacturer (CAD-CAM) fabricated endocrowns restoring endodontically treated molars using different machinable blocks with thermomechanical loading protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Devitalized mandibular molars were prepared in a standardized way and divided into 4 groups (n = 10) to receive CAD/CAM fabricated endocrowns using four materials (Lithium disilicate ceramics, polymer infiltrated ceramics, zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramics and resin nanoceramics. Marginal gaps (µm) were measured using stereomicroscope before cementation and after cementation. After thermomechanical aging, marginal gap measurements were repeated, and then fracture resistance test was performed. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD multiple comparisons were used to assess the effect of material on the marginal gap before, after cementation, and after thermomechanical aging. One Way ANOVA was used to assess the effect of material on the fracture resistance. RESULTS: The difference between marginal gaps values of the tested materials was statistically insignificant but with significant increase after cementation and after thermomechanical aging. Cerasmart endocrowns showed the highest mean fracture load value (1508.5 ± 421.7N) with statistically significant difference than Vita Enamic endocrowns and Celtra Duo. CONCLUSION: The tested materials showed marginal vertical gap readings within the limits of clinically acceptable standards. Resin nanoceramics and lithium disilicate showed the highest values of fracture resistance followed by polymer infiltrated ceramics favoring their use for endocrown restorations. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanical behavior of ceramic materials varies with the variation of their structure and mechanical properties. Accordingly, further investigation is always needed to explore the biomechanical behavior of recent materials when used as endocrowns before clinical trials.",2018,1,0,
256, Fracture toughness of chairside CAD/CAM materials - Alternative loading approach for compact tension test,"R. Badawy, O. El-Mowafy and L. E. Tam", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: This in-vitro study determined plane-strain fracture toughness (KIC) of five different chairside CAD/CAM materials used for crown fabrication, following alternative innovative loading approach of compact tension test specimens. METHODS: Rectangular-shaped specimens were cut from CAD/CAM blocks (n=10): Vita Mark II (Vident) (VMII); Lava-Ultimate (3M/ESPE) (LU); Vita Enamic (Vident) (VE); IPS e.max CAD (Ivoclar Vivadent); crystallized and un-crystallized (E-max and E-max-U, respectively); and Celtra Duo (Dentsply) fired and unfired (CD and CD-U, respectively). Specimens were notched with thin diamond disk prior to testing. Instead of applying tensile loading through drilled holes, a specially-made wedge-shaped steel loading-bar was used to apply compressive load at the notch area in Instron universal testing machine. The bar engaged the top ¼ of the notch before compressive load was applied at a cross-head speed of 0.5mm/min. Fracture load was recorded and KIC calculated. Data was statistically-analyzed with one-way ANOVA at 95% confidence level and Tukey's tests. RESULTS: Means and SDs of KIC in MPam(1/2) for VMII, LU, VE, E-max, E-max-U, CD and CD-U were: 0.73 (0.13), 0.85 (0.21), 1.02 (0.19), 1.88 (0.62), 0.81 (0.25), 2.65 (0.32) and 1.01 (0.15), respectively. ANOVA revealed significant difference among the groups (p<0.001). CD and E-max had significantly highest mean KIC values. SIGNIFICANCE: Mean KIC values of the tested materials varied considerably, however, none of them reached mean KIC of dentin (3.08MPam(1/2)) previously reported. For E-max and CD, specimens firing significantly increased mean KIC. The modified test arrangement was found to be easy to follow and simplified specimen preparation process.",2016,0,0,
474, Surface Evaluation of Resilient CAD/CAM ceramics after Contouring and Polishing,"G. D. Siddanna, A. J. Valcanaia, P. H. Fierro, G. F. Neiva and D. J. Fasbinder", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: This in-vitro study measured the differences in surface roughness for computer assisted design/computer assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) resilient ceramic and CAD/CAM composite materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials included Lava Ultimate (3 M), Cerasmart (GC America), Vita Enamic (Vita Zahnfabrik), and Brilliant Crios (Coltene). One calibrated operator polished each material with three polishing sytems: spiral polishers (Diacomp FeatherLite/Brasseler), rubbercup polishers (Enhance/DentsplyCaulk), and brush-paste (Diashine/VH Technologies). Surface roughness was assessed using a confocal laser microscope (Lext OLS4000/Olympus). RESULTS: A two-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences in mean surface roughness values (Sa) among materials and polishers. Tukey multiple comparisons showed that mean Sa values for Lava Ultimate, Enamic, Cerasmart and Brilliant Crios polished with brush-paste as well as Lava Ultimate and Cerasmart values polished with spiral polishers were not significantly different from each other. CONCLUSIONS: The finished surfaces were significantly smoother than milled surfaces for all materials. The brush-paste polishing technique created the lowest surface roughness values for all CAD/CAM materials and values were comparable to what was achieved by spiral polishers for Lava Ultimate and Cerasmart. Rubber polishers did not provide a clinically smooth surface for CAD/CAM resilient ceramic/composite materials. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the study indicate that polishing creates smooth surfaces for CAD/CAM resilient ceramic and CAD/CAM composite restorations.",2021,1,1,
488, The effect of different storage media on the monomer elution and hardness of CAD/CAM composite blocks,"R. A. Alamoush, R. Sung, J. D. Satterthwaite and N. Silikas", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of different storage media on the hardness and monomer elution of CAD/CAM composite blocks. METHODS: Five resin-composite blocks (RCB), one polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) block (Enamic (EN)), one ceramic-filled poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) block (Dentokeep (DK)), and one feldspathic ceramic block. Microhardness was measured using a Vickers indenter tester (FM-700, Future Tech Corp., Japan). In addition 4 conventional resin-composites were investigated for monomer elution using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after storage in different media for 3 months. The data were analysed by three-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc test and the independent t-test (α=0.05 for all tests). RESULTS: The specimens stored in the water had a hardness reduction ranging from 0.9% to 24.4%. In artificial saliva, the specimens had a hardness reduction ranging from 2.8% to 23.2%. The hardness reduction percentage in 75% Ethanol/Water (E/W) ranged between 3.8% and 35.3%. All materials, except GR (resin-composite block) and DK (Polyetheretherketone (PEEK)), showed a variable extent of monomer elution into 75% E/W with significantly higher amounts eluted from conventional composites. GRA and GND (conventional resin-composites) eluted TEGDMA in artificial saliva and GRA eluted TEGDMA in water. SIGNIFICANCE: The hardness of CAD/CAM composite blocks was affected by different storage media, and they were not as stable as ceramic, with PICN exhibited superior hardness stability to all of the resin-composite blocks in all the storage media and was comparable to ceramic block. The hardness reduction percentage of the CAD/CAM composite blocks was influenced by the filler loading and resin-matrix composition.Minimal or no monomer elution from CAD/CAM blocks was detected.",2021,1,1,
438, Response of two gingival cell lines to CAD/CAM composite blocks,"R. A. Alamoush, E. Kushnerev, J. M. Yates, J. D. Satterthwaite and N. Silikas", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the influence of CAD/CAM composite materials on human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and gingival keratinocytes (HGK). METHODS: Four materials were investigated: two resin-composite blocks (RCB), Grandio Blocs (GR) and Block HC (HC); one polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) (Enamic, EN); and one conventional resin-composite, Grandioso (GND). HGF and HGK were cultured as per the supplier's protocol (ATCC, UK). Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were evaluated at 1, 3, 5 and 10 days using LDH and Alamar Blue assays. Indirect immunostaining was used to assess the Caspase-3 activity. Data were analysed via two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test (α = 0.05 for all tests). RESULTS: There was significant difference in cell proliferation of the HGK and HGF cells in contact with different composite materials but no significant differences in their cytotoxicity. There was a significant effect on cell proliferation and cytotoxicity with different exposure times, for each type of resin-composite. HGF cell proliferation was higher than HGK with almost all investigated materials and at all time points. No Caspase-3 activity was detected in either cell lines. SIGNIFICANCE: HGK proliferation and cytotoxicity appeared to be more influenced by composite materials compared to HGF, demonstrating EN cytotoxic effects in HGK. Different manufacturing techniques of resin-composites (photo curing versus heat/pressure curing) had no significant effect on their biocompatibility.",2020,1,1,
203, Evaluation of radiopacities of CAD/CAM restorative materials and resin cements by digital radiography,"Z. U. Erzurumlu, C. E. Sagirkaya and K. Erzurumlu", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the radiopacities of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) blocks and the adhesive cements used for their bonding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1 ± 0.2 mm thick specimens were obtained from six different CAD/CAM blocks (Incoris TZI, IPS e.max CAD, Vita Mark II, Cerasmart, Vita Enamic, and Vita Suprinity), four different adhesive resin cements (Panavia F2.0, Variolink Esthetic DC, RelyX Unicem Aplicap, G-CEM LinkAce), and a tooth. Radiographs of the specimens from each group, a tooth section, and an aluminum (Al) step-wedge were acquired. The radiopacity values of the materials were calculated as equivalents of Al thickness using the gray level values. The data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests. RESULTS: All the materials except Cerasmart and Vita Enamic had significantly higher radiopacity values than dentin (p < 0.05). Of the assessed blocks, the highest radiopacity value was observed in Incoris TZI, and the lowest radiopacity value was observed in Vita Enamic. Variolink Esthetic DC and RelyX Unicem Aplicap showed significantly higher radiopacity (p < 0.05) than the other adhesive cements, including enamel and dentin. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the majority of the CAD/CAM materials and all the adhesive resin cements were found to have sufficient radiopacity for prosthetic restorations according to the criteria set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: From a clinical and biological point of view, materials should be chosen according to their radiopacity and other properties, such as biocompatibility and esthetics. If the selected restorative CAD/CAM blocks have a radiopacity value less than or equal to dentin, cements with higher radiopacity values are recommended to facilitate radiological diagnoses for periphery and interface of restorations.",2021,0,0,
401, Optical properties of contemporary monolithic CAD-CAM restorative materials at different thicknesses,B. Gunal and M. M. Ulusoy, J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the optical properties of contemporary monolithic CAD-CAM materials with different chemical compositions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Totally, 210 rectangular-shaped, A2 shade specimens (12 × 14 mm) were fabricated from VITA Suprinity T, VITA Enamic T, VITA Mark II, GC Cerasmart LT, Lava Ultimate LT, IPS e.max CAD LT and Prettau Anterior blocks and polished to thicknesses of 0.5 ± 0.01 and 1.0 ± 0.01 mm (n = 15 each material). A dental spectrophotometer (VITA Easyshade Compact) was used to calculate the translucency parameter (TP) and opalescence parameter (OP) values of all tested materials. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance, multiple comparison Tukey's test and independent samples t-test (P = .05). RESULTS: In the 0.5-mm thickness group, GC Cerasmart and Prettau Anterior had the highest and lowest translucency values, respectively. VITA Suprinity had the highest OP value, whereas VITA Mark II and Prettau Anterior had the lowest OP values. In the 1.0-mm thickness group, GC Cerasmart and Lava Ultimate had the highest translucency, whereas Prettau Anterior had the lowest translucency. VITA Suprinity and Prettau Anterior had the highest and lowest OP values, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The optical properties of monolithic restorative materials were influenced by the type and thickness of the material used. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: According to the results of this study, monolithic materials with different chemical compositions have revealed different optical properties. To obtain esthetic restorations and provide shade matching with natural dentition especially for anterior teeth, monolithic materials should be carefully chosen.",2018,0,0,
422," Reliability, failure probability, and strength of resin-based materials for CAD/CAM restorations","K. Lim, A. U. Yap, S. V. Agarwalla, K. B. Tan and V. Rosa", J Appl Oral Sci," OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the Weibull parameters and 5% fracture probability of direct, indirect composites, and CAD/CAM composites. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Discshaped (12 mm diameter x 1 mm thick) specimens were prepared for a direct composite [Z100 (ZO), 3M-ESPE], an indirect laboratory composite [Ceramage (CM), Shofu], and two CAD/CAM composites [Lava Ultimate (LU), 3M ESPE; Vita Enamic (VE), Vita Zahnfabrik] restorations (n=30 for each group). The specimens were polished, stored in distilled water for 24 hours at 37°C. Weibull parameters (m= modulus of Weibull, σ0= characteristic strength) and flexural strength for 5% fracture probability (σ5%) were determined using a piston-on-three-balls device at 1 MPa/s in distilled water. Statistical analysis for biaxial flexural strength analysis were performed either by both one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc (α=0.05) or by Pearson's correlation test. RESULTS: Ranking of m was: VE (19.5), LU (14.5), CM (11.7), and ZO (9.6). Ranking of σ0 (MPa) was: LU (218.1), ZO (210.4), CM (209.0), and VE (126.5). σ5% (MPa) was 177.9 for LU, 163.2 for CM, 154.7 for Z0, and 108.7 for VE. There was no significant difference in the m for ZO, CM, and LU. VE presented the highest m value and significantly higher than ZO. For σ0 and σ5%, ZO, CM, and LU were similar but higher than VE. CONCLUSION: The strength characteristics of CAD/ CAM composites vary according to their composition and microstructure. VE presented the lowest strength and highest Weibull modulus among the materials.",2016,0,1,
353, Marginal Gap Evaluation of Metal Onlays and Resin Nanoceramic Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing Blocks Onlays,"N. F. Abdul Hamid, W. Z. Wan Bakar and Z. Ariffin", Eur J Dent," OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to assess and compare the marginal gap of conventionally used metal onlays and new resin nanoceramic (RNC) (Lava Ultimate block) onlays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an in vitro study using two extracted sound human mandibular molars. One tooth was prepared to receive the metal onlays and another one for the RNC onlays which were fabricated using the computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. Twelve metals and 12 ceramic onlays were fabricated before they were placed at their respective preparation and examined under the Leica stereomicroscope, M125C (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) for a marginal analysis. The gap width was measured at 10 predefined landmarks which included 3 points on the buccal and lingual surfaces each and 2 points each on the mesial and distal surfaces, respectively. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney post hoc test was used for statistical analysis (P ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Overall, the RNC onlays showed significant lower marginal gap with the exception of the landmarks 5 and 6 (on distolingual) and no significant difference at landmark 7 (on midlingual). It was observed that the marginal gap were all within the clinically acceptable limit of 120 μm. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the RNC CAD/CAM onlays are a promising alternative to the metal onlays.",2019,1,0,
8, [Influence of different surface treatments on resin nano ceramic-resin cement bond strength],"H. B. Zhang, H. Huo and L. J. Liu", Hua Xi Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi," OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on the shear bond strength of resin nano ceramic to resin cement, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the improvement of clinical application. METHODS: A total of 150 specimens (10 mm×10 mm×3 mm) were milled from resin nano ceramic blocks (Lava Ultimate) using computer-aided design/computer aided manufacturing(CAD/CAM) technology. The specimens were randomly divided into five groups according to the surface treatment performed, as follows: control, sandblasted, sandblasted+silane, hydrofluoric acid, and hydrofluoric acid+silane groups. After the corresponding surface treatment, the specimens were cemented using Single Bond Universal Adhesive and RelyXTM Ultimate ClickerTM adhesive resin cement. All cemented specimens were placed in distilled water for 24 h and 30 days and subjected to a shear bond strength test in a universal testing machine. RESULTS: The surface treatment and water storage periods showed significant effects on bond strength. Surface treatment with sandblasted+silane showed the highest shear strength values among all tested groups, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). A difference was observed between the control and hydrofluoric acid groups, and both had significantly difference compared with other groups (P<0.05). Sandblasted and hydrofluoric acid+silane groups were not statistically different, and both had significantly difference compared with other groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The surface of resin nanoceramic treated by sand-blasted, sandblasted+silane, and hydrofluoric acid+silane can improve the bond strength. The sandblasted+silane group had the best the shear bond strength among the groups.",2020,1,0,
99, Damage tolerance of indirect restorative materials (including PICN) after simulated bur adjustments,"A. Coldea, J. Fischer, M. V. Swain and N. Thiel", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To analyze the damage tolerance of indirect restorative materials after grinding with diamond burs to simulate adjustments by clinicians and technicians. METHODS: Seven commercially available restorative materials (Mark II, ENAMIC, In-Ceram Alumina, VM 9, In-Ceram YZ, IPS e.max CAD) and an experimental one (PICN) were analyzed. Forty bending bars per material were fabricated according to manufacturer's instructions and lapped with 15 μm diamond suspension. The initial flexural strength was determined in three-point-bending on 10 specimens. Additionally the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were determined by the resonant frequency method. The remaining bending bars were divided into six groups (n=5) and subjected to standardized grinding with three different diamond grit burs (coarse, 151 μm; medium, 107 μm and extra fine 25 μm) and two grinding directions (transversal and longitudinal). The ground specimens were subsequently loaded to fracture and analyzed by SEM. RESULTS: Except for the YTZP bending bars, the initial materials strength of all tested materials decreased significantly with all diamond burs upon adjustments in both transversal and longitudinal grinding directions. The resistance of the ground materials to strength reduction follow the order from highest to least damage tolerant material: PICN>ENAMIC>Mark II>VM 9>In-Ceram Alumina>IPS e.max CAD. The loss in strength of all examined materials after longitudinal grinding is generally less compared to transversal grinding. The lowest loss in strength occurred for VM 9 (7.79%) and ENAMIC (9.18%) upon longitudinal grinding direction with extra fine and medium diamond grit bur, respectively. SIGNIFICANCE: The damage tolerance of restorative materials upon adjustments depends on specific mechanical properties and the adjustment procedure. The outcomes of the simulated grinding protocols of this study can be adopted clinically in terms of the selection of appropriate materials, burs and adjustment parameters.",2015,1,0,
500," The effects of thickness and shade on translucency parameters of contemporary, esthetic dental ceramics","I. S. Pop-Ciutrila, R. Ghinea, D. Dudea, J. Ruiz-López, M. M. Pérez and H. Colosi", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: To analyze translucency variations among four different contemporary esthetic ceramic systems having different shades and thicknesses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ceramic specimens having different shades and translucencies were tested: leucite reinforced glass-ceramic (ECAD), conventional feldspathic ceramic (Noritake), zirconia reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (Suprinity) and hybrid ceramic (Enamic). Specimens of 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0-mm thickness (n = 3/group, 615 total) were prepared. Translucency (TP) and Relative Translucency (RTP) Parameters were calculated from spectroradiometric color readings. Effects of shade and thickness for a given system were statistically analyzed using MANOVA and Tukey post-hoc multiple comparisons tests. Translucency variations were assessed comparatively with literature-based perceptibility and acceptability thresholds. RESULTS: TP/RTP values of all ceramic materials decreased with increasing thickness. The most translucent specimens were 0.6-mm thick ECAD HT-A3.5 (TP = 31.99) and ECAD HT-C2 (RTP = 23.75), while the least translucent was 2-mm thick Enamic T-3 M2 (TP = 7.27; RTP = 4.79). Thickness and material type significantly influenced translucency (p < 0.001). Noritake and ECAD LT showed similar translucency values, as well as Suprinity HT and ECAD LT. CONCLUSIONS: For ceramic restorations thicker than 0.9-mm, any thickness increase of 0.3-0.5 mm produces a perceptible but clinically acceptable translucency variation. Increases in thickness larger than 0.6-mm will result in an unacceptable translucency shift. Dental practitioners need to recognize key factors that influence translucency of ceramic restorations in order to choose the optimal material, shade, translucency, and thickness suitable for different clinical scenarios. While shade plays a minor role in translucency variation, ceramic type and restoration thickness significantly affect overall translucency.",2021,1,0,
336, Light irradiance through novel CAD-CAM block materials and degree of conversion of composite cements,"D. P. Lise, A. Van Ende, J. De Munck, K. Yoshihara, N. Nagaoka, L. C. Cardoso Vieira and B. Van Meerbeek", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To assess light irradiance (LI) delivered by two light-curing units (LCU's) and to measure the degree of conversion (DC) of three composite cements, when cured through different thicknesses of two novel CAD-CAM block materials. METHODS: 100-μm-thick films of a dual-curable composite cement (G-CEM LinkAce, GC), a light-curable flowable resin-based composite (RBC) (G-ænial Universal Flo, GC) and a micro-hybrid RBC (G-ænial Posterior, GC) were investigated as luting agents. Two 'polymer-ceramic' CAD-CAM blocks (Cerasmart, GC; Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik) were sectioned in slabs with different thicknesses (1, 3 and 5mm). LI at the bottom of the specimens was measured using a calibrated spectrometer, while being light-cured through the CAD-CAM block slabs for 40s with a low- (±500mW/cm(2)) or high- (±1,600mW/cm(2)) irradiance LCU (n=5). After light-curing, micro-Raman spectra of the composite films were acquired to determine DC at 5min, 10min, 1h and 24h. LI data were statistically analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis followed by post-hoc comparisons, while a linear mixed-effect model was applied for the DC analysis. In addition, the CAD-CAM blocks ultrastructure was characterized upon argon-ion slicing using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Finally, light transmission (LT) through each CAD-CAM block material was assessed using a spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Curing-light attenuation and DC were significantly influenced by thickness and type of the overlying material. LCU only had a significant effect on DC of the micro-hybrid RBC. DC significantly increased over time for all composite cements. CAD-CAM block structural analysis revealed a relatively small and homogenous filler configuration (mean filler size of 0.2-0.5μm) for Cerasmart, while Enamic contained ceramic grains varying in shape and size (1-10μm), which were interconnected by the polymer-based network. LT was much higher at a wavelength range of 300-800nm for Cerasmart than for Enamic. SIGNIFICANCE: Light-curable composite cements can be cured through a restoration up to 2.7-mm thickness, depending on the kind of CAD-CAM material. A high-irradiance LCU only has a limited effect on the maximum thickness of the polymer-ceramic CAD-CAM material that can be cured through.",2018,1,0,
457, Simulated fatigue resistance of composite resin versus porcelain CAD/CAM overlay restorations on endodontically treated molars,P. Magne and A. Knezevic, Quintessence Int," OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of material selection (porcelain versus composite resin) for overlay-type restoration of endodontically treated molars and its effect on the in vitro fatigue resistance and failure mode. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A standardized tooth preparation was applied to 30 extracted molars, including root canal treatment, 3-mm coverage of all cusps, a mesial box 1.5 mm below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), a distal box in enamel, a glass-ionomer base, and immediately sealed dentin. Using the Cerec machine (Sirona), all teeth were restored with an overlay of standardized thickness and occlusal anatomy. Fifteen restorations were milled in the ceramic Vita MKII block (Vident) and the other 15 using the composite resin Paradigm MZ100 block (3M ESPE). The intaglio surfaces of the ceramic restorations were etched and silanated. The intaglio surfaces of the composite resin overlays were airborne-particle abraded and silanated. Preparations were airborne-particle abraded and etched before restoration insertion. All restorations were adhesively luted with an adhesive resin (Optibond FL, Kerr) and a light-curing composite resin (Filtek Z100, 3M ESPE). Cyclic isometric chewing (5 Hz) was simulated, starting with a load of 200 N (5,000 cycles), followed by stages of 400, 600, 800, 1,000, 1,200, and 1,400 N at a maximum of 30,000 cycles each. Samples were loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 185,000 cycles. RESULTS: MKII overlays fractured at a mean load of 1,147 N, and none of them withstood all 185,000 loading cycles (survival = 0%); with MZ100, the survival rate was 73%. With MKII, 40% of the fractures ended below the CEJ; with MZ100, only 25% did. CONCLUSIONS: Composite resin MZ100 increased the fatigue resistance of overlay-type restorations in endodontically treated molars when compared to porcelain MKII. The efficiency of the bond strategy (immediate dentin sealing) was demonstrated by the absence of adhesive failures.",2009,0,1,
349, Marginal and internal fit of crowns based on additive or subtractive manufacturing,"Y. Haddadi, B. Ranjkesh, F. Isidor and G. Bahrami", Biomater Investig Dent," OBJECTIVE: To assess the marginal and internal fit of crowns manufactured by additive and subtractive manufacturing technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty extracted teeth prepared for complete coverage crowns were scanned with an intra-oral scanner (Omnicam, DentsplySirona). For the subtractive manufacturing (SM) group, ten crowns were manufactured in a hybrid resin block (Vita Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik). For the additive manufacturing (AM) group, the crowns were manufactured in a hybrid resin material (NextDent C&B, 3D systems). The design parameters were identical for the two groups. The marginal and internal fit (determined at the axial wall, the cusp tip and occlusally) was assessed before cementation with the replica technique and after cementation under stereomicroscope after sectioning of the crowned teeth. RESULTS: For the SM group, the marginal fit was 91 µm (±28 µm) before cementation and 85 µm (±18 µm) after cementation. In the AM group, the marginal fit was 75 µm (±29 µm) before cementation and 71 µm (±18 µm) after cementation. The differences were not statistically significant. As regards the internal fit, the fit at the axial wall was statistically significantly better in the SM group than in the AM group (p=.009 before cementation and .03 after cementation). Occlusally the fit in the AM group was significantly better than in the SM group after cementation (p<.001). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the current study, the marginal fit of additively manufactured crowns is comparable to crowns manufactured with chair-side subtractive technique and within the clinically acceptable range. As regards the internal fit no one technique was consistently superior.",2021,0,0,
93, Comparison of two test designs for evaluating the shear bond strength of resin composite cements,"M. Hu, R. Weiger and J. Fischer", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To compare a shear bond strength test for resin composite cements developed in order to better consider the shrinkage stress (here termed ""Swiss shear test"") with the shear test design according to ISO 29022. METHOD: Four restorative materials (VITA Enamic (VE), VITA Suprinity (VS), Vitablocs Mark II (VM) and VITA YZ T (YZ)) served as substrate. VE, VS and VM were polished or etched. YZ was polished, sandblasted or etched. Specimens were either bonded according to the Swiss or the ISO shear test. RelyX Unicem 2 Automix, Maxcem Elite and PermaFlo DC were used as cements. Shear bond strength (SBS) was measured. Failure modes (adhesive, cohesive or mixed) were evaluated by means of SEM. RESULTS: Mean SBS values obtained with the Swiss shear test were significantly lower than those obtained with the ISO shear test. VE and VM exhibited similar SBS, values of VS were significantly higher. On etched surfaces VM and VE exhibited primarily cohesive failures, VS primarily adhesive failures. On polished substrates significantly lower bond strength values and exclusively adhesive failures were observed. YZ exhibited solely adhesive failures. Compared to polished YZ, SBS significantly increased after sandblasting and even more after etching. Only for adhesively failed specimens mean SBS values of Swiss and ISO shear test were strongly correlated. SIGNIFICANCE: Both test designs showed the same ranking of test results. When adhesive failure occurred test results were strongly correlated. When cohesive failure was involved, both test designs did not provide reliable results.",2016,0,0,
403, Optimization of large MOD restorations: Composite resin inlays vs. short fiber-reinforced direct restorations,"L. M. Soares, M. Razaghy and P. Magne", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To compare mechanical performance and enamel-crack propensity of direct, semi-direct, and CAD/CAM approaches for large MOD composite-resin restorations. METHODS: 45 extracted maxillary molars underwent standardized slot-type preparation (5-mm depth and bucco-palatal width) including immediate dentin sealing (Optibond FL) for the inlays (30 teeth). Short-fiber reinforced composite-resin (EverX Posterior covered by Gradia Direct Posterior) was used for the direct approach, Gradia Direct Posterior for the semi-direct, and Cerasmart composite resin blocks for CAD/CAM inlays. All inlays were adhesively luted with light-curing composite-resin (preheated Gradia Direct Posterior). Shrinkage-induced enamel cracks were tracked by transillumination photography. Cyclic axial isometric chewing (5-Hz) was simulated, starting with a load of 200N (5000 cycles), followed by stages of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1400N (maximum 30,000 cycles each) until fracture or to a maximum of 185,000 cycles. Survived specimens were subjected to cyclic-load-to-failure test at 30-degree angle on the palatal cusp. RESULTS: Only small shrinkage-induced cracks were found in 47% of the direct restorations compared to 7% and 13% of semi-direct and CAD/CAM inlays, respectively. Survival to accelerated fatigue was similar for all three groups (Kaplan-Meier p>.05) and ranged between 87% (direct) and 93% (semi-direct and CAD/CAM). Cyclic-load-to-failure tests did not yield significant differences either (Life Table analysis, p>.05) with median values of 1675N for CAD/CAM inlays, 1775N for fiber-reinforced direct restorations and 1900N for semi-direct inlays. SIGNIFICANCE: All three restorative techniques yielded excellent mechanical performance above physiological masticatory loads. Direct restorations performed as good as inlays when a short-fiber reinforced composite-resin base was used.",2018,0,1,
1, [Analysis of edge morphology of partial veneers made by different processing techniques and materials],"R. J. Wang, M. Liu, D. Y. Song, S. Yang, Q. Wang, L. Wang and H. L. Feng", Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban," OBJECTIVE: To compare the edge morphology of partial veneers made of different materials by slurry molding, heat-pressed and computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques. METHODS: Thirty premolars with smooth surface and intact enamel were selected and randomly divided into five groups, 6 specimens for each group. Group A were made from feldspathic porcelain (Noritake®) by slurry molding, while Group B were made from lithium disilicate glass ceramic (IPS E.max® Press) by heat-pressed. Group C/D/E were respectively made from feldspar porcelain block (VITA Mark II®), zirconia-reinforced glass ceramic (VITA Suprinity®) and hybrid ceramic with a ceramic-polymer network (VITA Enamic®) by CAD/CAM techniques. All the partial veneers luted with light-cured composite resin. Then the partial veneers were trimmed and polished to achieve the smooth finishing margin, clinical polishing sets were used according to the product descriptions. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the edge morphology of prostheses and the exposure of resin cements. RESULTS: The smooth surface and knife-like edge of the partial veneers could be obtained after bonding, trimming and polishing. The edges of Group A were slightly rough and the width of the exposed adhesive was (106.00±9.17) μm. In Group B, the edges were smoother than Group A, and the exposed wide adhesive strip was visible, which was (138.33±20.59) μm. In Group E, the edges were smooth too, and the width of exposed adhesive strip was (186.00±5.66) μm. The edges of Group C and Group D were rough and uneven, and the adhesive was rarely exposed, they were (50.67±7.51) μm and (65.67±17.90) μm. There were all significant differences between two groups, except Group C and Group D. CONCLUSION: After trimming and polishing in accordance with clinical procedures, the expected knife-like edge can be obtained in all groups. The width of the exposed resin adhesive of each group is different, the order: Mark II/Suprinity < Noritake < E.max Press < Enamic. The edge morphology of partial veneers in different processing technic and materials are different.",2019,1,0,
225, Fatigue resistance of CAD/CAM resin composite molar crowns,"F. A. Shembish, H. Tong, M. Kaizer, M. N. Janal, V. P. Thompson, N. J. Opdam and Y. Zhang", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the fatigue behavior of CAD/CAM resin composite molar crowns using a mouth-motion step-stress fatigue test. Monolithic leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic crowns were used as a reference. METHODS: Fully anatomically shaped monolithic resin composite molar crowns (Lava Ultimate, n=24) and leucite reinforced glass-ceramic crowns (IPS Empress CAD, n=24) were fabricated using CAD/CAM systems. Crowns were cemented on aged dentin-like resin composite tooth replicas (Filtek Z100) with resin-based cements (RelyX Ultimate for Lava Ultimate or Multilink Automix for IPS Empress). Three step-stress profiles (aggressive, moderate and mild) were employed for the accelerated sliding-contact mouth-motion fatigue test. Twenty one crowns from each group were randomly distributed among these three profiles (1:2:4). Failure was designated as chip-off or bulk fracture. Optical and electron microscopes were used to examine the occlusal surface and subsurface damages, as well as the material microstructures. RESULTS: The resin composite crowns showed only minor occlusal damage during mouth-motion step-stress fatigue loading up to 1700N. Cross-sectional views revealed contact-induced cone cracks in all specimens, and flexural radial cracks in 2 crowns. Both cone and radial cracks were relatively small compared to the crown thickness. Extending these cracks to the threshold for catastrophic failure would require much higher indentation loads or more loading cycles. In contrast, all of the glass-ceramic crowns fractured, starting at loads of approximately 450N. SIGNIFICANCE: Monolithic CAD/CAM resin composite crowns endure, with only superficial damage, fatigue loads 3-4 times higher than those causing catastrophic failure in glass-ceramic CAD crowns.",2016,0,1,
142, Effect of home and over the contour bleaching on stainability of CAD/CAM esthetic restorative materials,"N. Tinastepe, O. Malkondu, I. Iscan and E. Kazazoglu", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of home and over the counter bleaching on the stainability of CAD/CAM restorative materials, and to correlate the surface roughness with discoloration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens were fabricated from feldspathic ceramic, an hybrid ceramic, a resin nano-ceramic, and lithium disilicate-reinforced glass ceramic. After baseline surface roughness (Ra1) and color measurement, each material was randomly divided into three groups according to bleaching regimen as Opalescence PF and; Opalescence Go; control. Then, the second color and surface roughness (Ra2) measurements were made. Thereafter, all specimens were immersed in a coffee solution for 12 days and the third color measurement was made. Color and whiteness change (CIELAB- ΔE(ab) , CIEDE2000-ΔE(00) , whiteness index-ΔWI(D) ) were calculated after bleaching (ΔE1;ΔE(00) 1;ΔWI(D) 1) and immersion in the coffee solution (ΔE2;ΔE(00) 2;ΔWI(D) 2). RESULTS: According to both CIELAB, CIEDE 2000 and WI(D) formulas, the highest mean ΔE1, ΔE2, ΔWI(D) 1, ΔWI(D) 2 values were observed for LAVA Ultimate groups while the lowest values were measured for e.max CAD groups. The findings also showed that there was a positively significant relationship between Ra2, and ΔE2 and ΔWI(D) 2. CONCLUSIONS: Type of restorative materials and bleaching agents had an impact on color change after bleaching and immersion in coffee. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Home and over-the-counter bleaching agents may cause an increase in susceptibility of restorative materials to staining.",2021,1,0,
270, Impact of different adhesives on work of adhesion between CAD/CAM polymers and resin composite cements,"C. Keul, M. Müller-Hahl, M. Eichberger, A. Liebermann, M. Roos, D. Edelhoff and B. Stawarczyk", J Dent," OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of pre-treatment of adhesive systems on the work of adhesion (WA) between CAD/CAM polymers and resin composite cements and compare with conventional tests of previous studies. METHODS: Surface parameters were measured by contact angle measurement (2700 measurements) and WA was calculated. Five CAD/CAM polymers were used for fabrication of specimens (n=75/subgroup): artBloc Temp (A), Telio CAD (B), Nano Composite CFI-C (C), exp. CAD/CAM nanohybrid composite (D), and LAVA Ultimate (E). Then, air-abraded specimens were pre-treated (n=15 per group): Ambarino P60 (I), Monobond Plus/Heliobond (II), visio.link (III), VP connect (IV), and no pre-treatment (V). Resin composite cement specimens (n=75) were smoothed out homogeneously on a glass plate (n=15/group): RelyX ARC (RXA), Variolink II (VAR), Panavia F2.0 (PAN), RelyX Unicem (RXU), and Clearfil SA Cement (CSA). Contact angles were determined with 3 drops of distilled water and diiodomethane each. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis-H test and Spearman-Rho correlation (p<0.05). RESULTS: CAD/CAM materials (B), (A), and (C) showed higher WA compared to (D) and (E). (II) and (IV) resulted in higher WA than (I), (III) and (V). VAR had the significantly lowest WA, followed by RXU, RXA, CSA and PAN. No correlation occurred between WA and TBS/SBS whereas polar component of surface free energy of CAD/CAM resin and spreading coefficient showed significant positive correlation with TBS/SBS. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of WA is not a proper method to draw conclusions about the bond between resin materials. Destructive test methods are not dispensable. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The successful outcome of fixed dental restorations depends, among others, on the quality of bonding between the tooth and the restoration. Additional pre-treatment of the dental CAD/CAM resin restoration by bonding systems can be recommended for clinical use. Pre-treatment showed a significant impact on the surface properties.",2014,0,1,
330, Investigating the limits of resin-based luting composite photopolymerization through various thicknesses of indirect restorative materials,"C. M. F. Hardy, S. Bebelman, G. Leloup, M. A. Hadis, W. M. Palin and J. G. Leprince", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To determine the limitations of using light-curable resin-based luting composites (RBLCs) to bond indirect ceramic/resin-composite restorations by measuring light transmittance through indirect restorative materials and the resulting degree of conversion (DC) of the luting-composites placed underneath. METHODS: Various thicknesses (0-4mm) and shades of LAVA Zirconia and LAVA Ultimate were prepared and used as light curing filters. A commercial, light curable RBLC, RelyX Veneer (control) was compared with four experimental RBLCs of the following composition: TEGDMA/BisGMA (50/50 or 30/70wt%, respectively); camphorquinone/amine (0.2/0.8wt%) or Lucirin-TPO (0.42wt%); microfillers (55wt%) and nanofillers (10wt%). RBLCs covered with the LAVA filter were light-cured for 40s, either with the dual-peak BluephaseG2 or an experimental device emitting either in the blue or violet visible band. The samples were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy to determine DC. Light transmittance through the filters was measured using a common spectroscopy technique. RESULTS: All the factors studied significantly influenced DC (p<0.05). RBLCs with increased TEGDMA content exhibited higher DC. Only small differences were observed comparing DC without filters and filters ≤1mm (p>0.05). For thicknesses ≥2mm, significant reductions in DC were observed (p<0.05). Transmittance values revealed higher filter absorption at 400nm than 470nm. A minimal threshold of irradiance measured through the filters that maintained optimal DC following 40s irradiation was identified for each RBLC formulation, and ranged between 250-500mW/cm(2). SIGNIFICANCE: This work confirmed that optimal photopolymerization of RBLCs through indirect restorative materials (≤4mm) and irradiation time of 40s is possible, but only in some specific conditions. The determination of such conditions is likely to be key to clinical success, and all the factors need to be optimized accordingly.",2018,1,1,
19, A novel CAD/CAM resin composite block with high mechanical properties,"L. Ling, Y. Ma and R. Malyala", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanical properties of a newly-developed CAD/CAM resin composite block and compare with other resin composite blocks and a polymer-infiltrated ceramic block. METHODS: Experimental composite block was formulated by our proprietary resin and filler technologies and cured via Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). Bar-shaped specimens (1 × 4×12 - 13 mm, n = 10) for flexural strength, flexural modulus and modulus of resilience were sectioned from block materials and measured in accordance to modified ISO-6872. Cylinder specimens for compressive strength (2 × 4 mm, n = 8) and for diametral tensile strength (6 × 3 mm, n = 8) were milled from the block materials and tested according to ASTM-D695 and ANSI/ADA-Specification #27, respectively. Block specimens (5 mm, n = 3) for Vickers hardness were polished and measured for five indentations on each specimen. The data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey tests (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Experimental composite block showed higher or significantly higher flexural strength, flexural modulus, modulus of resilience, compressive strength, diametral tensile strength and Vickers hardness than the other commercially available block materials except Vita Enamic for flexural modulus and hardness and Cerasmart for modulus of resilience. Some positive correlations were observed among the different mechanical properties. SIGNIFICANCE: New composite block exhibited higher mechanical properties as compared to commercially available composite block materials. Superior mechanical properties for resin composite block materials were obtained by composite and curing processing technologies. Resin composite blocks with higher mechanical properties are good options for the fabrication of CAD/CAM indirect restorations.",2021,1,1,
448," Shade Correspondence, Color, and Translucency Differences between Human Dentine and a CAD/CAM Hybrid Ceramic System","I. S. Pop-Ciutrila, D. Dudea, M. Eugenia Badea, M. Moldovan, S. I. Cîmpean and R. Ghinea", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: To determine the shade correspondence between human dentine and two versions of a CAD/CAM hybrid ceramic system and to investigate color and translucency differences between these materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four samples of different shades and opacities were fabricated from Vita Enamic CAD/CAM ceramic blocks. Human dentine samples were obtained from 73 extracted maxillary teeth. Color coordinates of all samples were measured using VitaEasyshade spectrophotometer. The translucency parameter (TP) and ΔEab* and ΔE00 color differences, with respect to human dentine of anterior and posterior teeth, were calculated. RESULTS: Vita Enamic Translucent was the best match for anterior teeth (>90% of cases) while Vita Enamic T 3M2 was the best option for the dentine samples of posterior teeth in 78.8% ( ΔEab*) and 54.5% ( ΔE00) of the cases. The smallest differences in translucency ( ΔTP) with the dentine samples of anterior teeth were obtained for Vita Enamic T 3M2 (92.5%) and with those of posterior teeth for Vita Enamic HT 1M2 (45.4%). CONCLUSIONS: VITA Enamic Translucent is the best option as color match for both anterior and posterior teeth dentine. In terms of translucency, VITA Enamic Translucent closely matched anterior teeth dentine while for posterior teeth, VITA Enamic HT was the best option. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the present study could help clinicians in their decision of choosing a specific shade and translucency for their anterior or posterior esthetic restorations with hybrid ceramics.

397, Optical and colorimetric evaluation of a multi-color polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network material,"R. Pulgar, C. Lucena, C. Espinar, O. E. Pecho, J. Ruiz-López, A. Della Bona and M. M. Pérez", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate color, translucency parameter and optical properties (scattering (S), absorption (K) and transmittance (T)) of a multi-color polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) material. METHODS: Samples of shades 1M1-HT, 1M2-HT, 2M2-HT, 3M2-HT, and 4M2-HT from VITA ENAMIC(®) multiColor (E-MC) High Translucent were fabricated (n = 3). CAD-CAM blocks were cut and polished to 1.00 ± 0.01 mm of thickness. Diffuse reflectance and color coordinates were measured against white and black backgrounds, using a calibrated spectroradiometer, CIE D65 illuminant and the CIE 45°/0° geometry. Color and translucency differences were evaluated using 50:50% perceptibility (PT and TPT) and 50:50% acceptability (AT and TAT) thresholds. S and K coefficients and T were calculated using Kubelka-Munk's equations. Data was statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney tests, and VAF coefficient. RESULT: Mean C* and b* values increased from incisal to cervical layers with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). In general, ΔE(00) between sequential layers were above PT for all shades. In addition, translucency parameter (TP) increased from cervical to incisal and ΔTP(00) values were greater than TPT(00) and lower than TAT(00) between all sequential layers. Layers from all shades showed similar spectral behavior for S (97.4% ≤ VAF), K (85.0% ≤ VAF) coefficients and T (95.3% ≤ VAF). However, these values presented significant differences (p < 0.05) from cervical to incisal layers. SIGNIFICANCE: The gradient in color and translucency of this novel CAD-CAM multi-color PICN material can assist dental technicians and dentists to reach greater esthetics than the pre-existing CAD-CAM monolithicmaterials.",2019,1,0,
305, Influence of material selection on the risk of inlay fracture during pre-cementation functional occlusal tapping,"P. Magne, M. P. Paranhos and L. H. Schlichting", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro the pre-cementation resistance of CAD/CAM inlays subjected to functional occlusal tapping. METHODS: An extracted tooth model (molar and premolar) with simulated bone and periodontal ligament was used to make a medium-size mesio-occlusal inlay preparation (molar). Immediate dentin sealing was applied to the prepared tooth. The corresponding inlays were fabricated with Cerec either using composite resin (Paradigm MZ100) or ceramic (e.max CAD and Mark II) blocks (n=14). A high marginal ridge was designed in order to generate hyper-occlusion. Pre-cementation occlusal tapping was simulated using closed-loop servo-hydraulics at 2 Hz, starting with a load of 40 N, followed by 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, and 280 N (10 cycles each). All samples were loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 70 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table survival analysis (p=0.016, Bonferroni method). RESULTS: Survival probability was e.max CAD>MZ100>Mark II. None of the specimens survived the 70 cycles except for two e.max CAD inlays (survival: 14%). SIGNIFICANCE: Material selection has a significant effect on the risk of Cerec inlay fracture during pre-cementation functional occlusal tapping.",2011,0,1,

Paranhos", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro the pre-cementation resistance of CAD/CAM onlays subjected to functional occlusal tapping. METHODS: An extracted tooth model (molar and premolar) with simulated bone and periodontal ligament was used to make a mesio-occlusal onlay preparation (two mesial cusps covered). Immediate dentin sealing was applied to the prepared tooth. The corresponding onlays were fabricated with Cerec either using composite resin (Paradigm MZ100) or ceramic (e.max CAD and Mark II) (n=14). An elevated marginal ridge was designed with the intention of generating hyper-occlusion. Pre-cementation occlusal tapping was simulated using closed-loop servo-hydraulics at 2 Hz, starting with a load of 40 N, followed by 80, 120, 160, 200, 240 and 280 N (10 cycles each). All samples were loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 70 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table survival analysis (p=.016, Bonferroni method). RESULTS: Survival probability was MZ100>e.max CAD>Mark II. The restorations made from e.max CAD and Mark II failed at an average load of 157 N and 123 N, respectively with no specimen withstanding all 70 load cycles (survival 0%); with MZ100 the survival rate was 36%. SIGNIFICANCE: Material selection has a significant effect on the risk of CAD/CAM onlay fracture during pre-cementation functional occlusal tapping with composite resin onlays showing the minimum risk compared to ceramic ones.",2011,0,1,
28, Adhesive luting of new CAD/CAM materials,"R. Frankenberger, V. E. Hartmann, M. Krech, N. Krämer, S. Reich, A. Braun and M. Roggendorf", Int J Comput Dent," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the adhesive bonding performance of recently introduced tooth-colored CAD/CAM materials after different pretreatment protocols and using different luting materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CAD/CAM materials under investigation were e.max CAD (lithium disilicate glass ceramic; Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), Celtra Duo (zirconia-reinforced lithium disilicate ceramic; Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany), Lava Ultimate (resin nano ceramic; 3M ESPE, Neuss, Germany), and Enamic (resin infiltrated ceramic; Vita, Bad Säckingen, Germany). A total of 240 blocks (n = 5) received various pretreatments (no pretreatment, silane, sandblasting, sandblasting + silane, hydrofluoric acid, hydrofluoric acid + silane), and then different classes of adhesive luting composites were applied (adhesive: Prime&Bond XP + SCA + Calibra; Dentsply DeTrey; self adhesive: RelyX Unicem; 3M ESPE). After 24 h water storage and 10,000 thermocycles (5°C/55°C), specimens were cut into beams and microtensile bond strengths were recorded. RESULTS: Bonding performance of recent CAD/CAM materials was clearly influenced by the pretreatment method (P < 0.05). In general, significantly higher μ-TBS values were recorded for the ceramic materials compared to the hybrid materials (P < 0.05). Among the hybrid materials, Enamic exhibited higher bond strengths than Lava Ultimate (P < 0.05). However, despite the differences found, all materials showed a high level of bonding performance, being sufficient to withstand intraoral chewing forces during mastication. CONCLUSION: When pretreated as recommended by the manufacturers, recent tooth-colored CAD/CAM materials show an encouraging bonding performance for adhesive luting.",2015,1,0,
392, Morphological analysis of three zirconium oxide ceramics: Effect of surface treatments,"A. Casucci, C. Mazzitelli, F. Monticelli, M. Toledano, R. Osorio, E. Osorio, F. Papacchini and M. Ferrari", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of different chemo-mechanical surface treatments on the morphology of three recently marketed dental zirconia ceramics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ceramic discs (Ø 10 mm x 1 mm height) were obtained from three sintered zirconia ceramics (Lava, Cercon, and Aadva Zr) and treated with: (1) airborne particle abrasion with 125 microm Al(2)O(3) particles (S); (2) selective infiltration etching (SIE); (3) experimental hot etching solution applied for 30 min (ST); (4) no treatment (C). Five discs per group were used for surface roughness analysis using an atomic force microscope (AFM). Data were statistically analyzed by Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney tests (alpha<0.05). The same discs were evaluated under SEM for surface topography analysis. Three discs per group were cemented to a composite overlay (Paradigm MZ100) with a total-etch resin luting agent (Calibra) and cross-section interfacial analysis was performed under SEM. RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Airborne particle abrasion improved the average surface roughness of Cercon and Lava (p<0.05) while SIE induced significant changes on Lava and Adava Zr. Statistical differences in surface roughness were recorded after selective infiltration etching when compared to no treated group, independently from the zirconia type. SEM and AFM analyses revealed changes in surface topography for all the tested ceramics and intergrain spaces opening, especially after ST. The effectiveness of the tested chemo-mechanical surface treatments depends on the zirconia type. The hot experimental etching solution increased the surface roughness of all the tested ceramics creating retentive micro-spaces that may potentially improve zirconia/resin cement interfacial strengths.",2010,0,1,
289, In-office bleaching efficacy on stain removal from CAD/CAM and direct resin composite materials,"A. Alharbi, S. Ardu, T. Bortolotto and I. Krejci", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of in-office bleaching on stain removal from stained resin composite and ceramic computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) blocks and direct resin composites. METHODS: Forty disk-shaped samples were fabricated from each of nine materials: six CAD/CAM (VITABLOCS Mark II, Paradigm MZ100, Exp Vita Hybrid Ceramic, VITA ENAMIC, Exp Kerr, and LAVA Ultimate) and three direct resin composites (Filtek Supreme, Venus Diamond, and Filtek Silorane). Samples were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8), each stained with a particular staining solution. Using a calibrated spectrophotometer and a black background, L*a*b* values were assessed before and after 120 days of staining. Samples were subjected to in-office bleaching using 40% hydrogen peroxide gel for one hour. At subsequent assessment, color change (ΔE) was calculated as the difference between L*a*b* values. Both ANOVA and the Duncan test were used to identify differences between groups (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Bleaching resulted in significant differences in ΔE values for all materials (P < .001). Bleaching efficacy was highly influenced by material composition and staining solution. Residual color values after bleaching for ceramic and hybrid ceramics ranged from -0.49 to 2.35, within the clinically acceptable maximum of 3.3. Values after bleaching for resin-based CAD/CAM ranged from -0.7 to 7.08 while direct resin composites values ranged from -1.47 to 25.13. Coffee left the greatest residual color on all materials. CONCLUSIONS: Based on material nature, 40% hydrogen peroxide bleaching can remove staining. The new resin-based CAD/CAM blocks showed promising results in terms of color stability. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Bleaching using 40% hydrogen peroxide can be an effective method to remove stains from dental restorations. In this way, restoration replacement as a result of discoloration may no longer be necessary.",2018,1,1,
218," Fatigue performance of adhesively cemented glass-, hybrid- and resin-ceramic materials for CAD/CAM monolithic restorations","A. B. Venturini, C. Prochnow, G. K. R. Pereira, R. D. Segala, C. J. Kleverlaan and L. F. Valandro", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the fatigue failure load, number of cycles until failure, and survival probability of adhesively cemented materials with different microstructures (glass-, hybrid- and resin-ceramic) used to manufacture CAD/CAM monolithic restorations. METHODS: Disc-shaped specimens (n=15; Ø=10mm; thickness=1.0mm) were produced from CAD/CAM blocks as follows: feldspathic (FEL); leucite (LEU); lithium disilicate (LD); zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZRLS); polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN); and resin nanoceramic (RNC). Adhesive cementation was performed onto epoxy discs (dentin analogue- Ø=10mm; thickness=2.5mm). The cemented assemblies were subjected to fatigue testing using a step-stress approach (400N-2200N; step-size of 200N; 10,000 cycles per step; 1.4Hz). Fatigue data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox (log-rank) tests (p<0.05) and Weibull statistical analysis. Fractographic analysis was also performed. RESULTS: All RNC specimens survived the fatigue test (100% probability of survival at 2200N; 100,000 cycles) and presented occlusal deformation in response to loading, while all other tested materials failed in distinct loading steps with radial cracks starting from the bonding surface. LD (1146.7N; 47,333) and ZRLS (1013.3N; 40,666) materials obtained the highest fatigue failure loads and cycles until failure, meanwhile all PICN specimens failed during the first step (0% probability of survival at 400N; 10,000). FEL had similar Weibull modulus to LD and ZRLS and higher than LEU for both load and number of cycles outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: The microstructure of adhesively cemented glass-, hybrid- and resin-ceramic CAD/CAM restorative materials influence their response during fatigue testing, which aids in suggesting the best clinical indications.",2019,1,0,

Crowns were cemented on the abutments, and the assembly underwent step-stress accelerated-life testing. Use level probability Weibull curves at 300 N were plotted and the reliability at 300, 500 and 800 N was calculated for a mission of 50,000 cycles. Fractographic analysis was performed using stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope. MP Stress and MP Strain were determined by finite element analysis. RESULTS: While fatigue dictated failures for Cerasmart (β > 1), material strength controlled Shofu Hard, Enamic, and Shofu HC failures (β < 1). Shofu HC presented lower reliability at 300 N (79%) and 500 N (59%) than other systems (>90%), statistically different at 500 N. Enamic (57%) exhibited a significant reduction in the probability of survival at 800 N, significantly lower than Shofu Hard and Cerasmart; however, higher than Shofu HC (12%). Shofu Hard and Cerasmart (>93%) demonstrated no significant difference for any calculated mission (300-800 N). Failure mode predominantly involved resin-matrix ceramic fracture originated from occlusal cracks, corroborating with the MP Stress and Strain location, propagating through the proximal and cervical margins. SIGNIFICANCE: All resin-matrix ceramics crowns demonstrated high probability of survival in a physiological molar load, whereas Shofu Hard and Cerasmart outperformed Enamic and Shofu HC at higher loads. Material fracture comprised the main failure mode.",2021,1,0,
259, Gloss and Stain Resistance of Ceramic-Polymer CAD/CAM Restorative Blocks,N. C. Lawson and J. O. Burgess, J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the gloss and stain resistance of several new ceramic-polymer CAD/CAM blocks MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens (4 mm) were sectioned from: Enamic (polymer-infused ceramic), LAVA Ultimate (nano-ceramic reinforced polymer), e.max (lithium disilicate), Paradigm C (porcelain), and Paradigm MZ100 (composite). Specimens were wet polished on a polishing wheel to either 320 grit silicon paper (un-polished, N = 8) or 2000 grit silicon carbide papers followed by a 0.05 μm alumina slurry (polished, N = 8). Initial gloss and color (L*a*b*) values were measured. Specimens were stored in a staining solution at 37°C in darkness for 12 days (simulating 1 year). After storage, L*a*b* values re-measured. Change in color was reported as ΔE00 based on the CIEDE2000 formula. Gloss and ΔE00 were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (alpha = .05). Separate one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc analyses were performed for both polish conditions and all materials. RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA showed that factors material, polish and their interaction were significant for both gloss and ΔE00 (p < .01). Post-hoc analysis reveals that polished specimens had significantly less color change than un-polished specimens for Paradigm C and LAVA Ultimate. E.max had significantly higher gloss and less color change than all other materials. CONCLUSION: The composition and polish of CAD/CAM materials affects gloss and stain resistance. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Ceramic-polymer hybrid materials can achieve the high gloss required for esthetic restorations. These materials should be polished in order to minimize staining. If polished, all of the tested materials exhibited clinically acceptable color changes at 1 year of simulated staining. (J Esthet Restor Dent 28:S40-S45, 2016).",2016,1,1,
163, Effect of surface pre-treatments on the zirconia ceramic-resin cement microtensile bond strength,"A. Casucci, F. Monticelli, C. Goracci, C. Mazzitelli, A. Cantoro, F. Papacchini and M. Ferrari", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of different surface treatments on the microtensile bond strength of resin cement to zirconia ceramic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve cylinder-shaped (∅ 12×5.25 mm high) blocks of a commercial zirconium-oxide ceramic (Cercon® Zirconia, DENTSPLY) were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=3), based on the surface treatment to be performed: (1) airborne particle abrasion with 125 μm Al₂O₃ particles (S); (2) selective infiltration etching (SIE); (3) experimental hot etching solution applied for 30 min (ST) and (4) no treatment (C). Paradigm MZ100 blocks (3M ESPE) were cut into twelve cylinders of 4mm in thickness. Composite cylinders were bonded to conditioned ceramics using a resin cement (Calibra®, DENTSPLY), in combination with the proprietary adhesive system. After 24h bonded specimens were cut into microtensile sticks and loaded in tension until failure. Bond strength data were analyzed with Kruskall-Wallis and Dunn's Multiple Range test for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05). Failure mode distribution was recorded and the interfacial morphology of debonded specimens was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS: Bond strength values achieved after SIE and ST treatment were significantly higher than after S treatment and without any treatment (p < 0.05). Premature failures were mostly recorded in the S group. SIGNIFICANCE: Conditioning the high-strength ceramic surface with SIE and ST treatments yielded higher bond strengths of the resin cement than when zirconia ceramic was treated with airborne particle abrasion or left untreated.",2011,0,1,

Krejci", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of different types of modifications with resin on fatigue resistance and failure behavior of CAD-CAM resin nano ceramic (RNC) restorations for maxillary first premolars. METHODS: Sixty standardized resin composite root dies received CAD-CAM RNC endocrowns (n=30) and crowns (n=30) (Lava Ultimate, 3M Espe). Restorations were divided into six groups: full anatomic endocrowns (group A) and crowns (group D), buccal resin veneered endocrowns (group B) and crowns (group E) and buccal resin veneered endocrowns (group C) and crowns (group F) with a central groove resin filling. A nano-hybrid resin composite was used to veneer the restorations (Filtek Supreme, 3M Espe). All specimens were first submitted to thermo-mechanical cyclic loading (1.7Hz, 49N, 600000 cycles, 1500 thermo-cycles) and then submitted to cyclic isometric stepwise loading (5Hz) until completion of 105000 cycles or failure after 5000 cycles at 200N, followed by 20000 cycles at 400N, 600N, 800N, 1000N and 1200N. In case of fracture, fragments were analyzed using SEM and modes of failure were determined. Results were statistically analyzed by Kaplan-Meier life survival analysis and log rank test (p=0.05). RESULTS: The differences in survival between groups were not statistically significant, except between groups D and F (p=0.039). Endocrowns fractured predominantly with a mesio-distal wedge-opening fracture (82%). Partial cusp fractures were observed above all in crowns (70%). Analysis of the fractured specimens revealed that the origin of the fracture was mainly at the occlusal contact points of the stepwise loading. SIGNIFICANCE: Veneering of CAD-CAM RNC restorations has no influence on their fatigue resistance except when monolithic crowns are modified on their occlusal central groove.",2016,1,0,
354, Masking ability of indirect restorative systems on tooth-colored resin substrates,"M. M. Basegio, O. E. Pecho, R. Ghinea, M. M. Perez and A. Della Bona", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the masking ability of different indirect restorative systems (IRS) on tooth-colored resin substrates. METHODS: A1-shaded specimens from 5 IRS (LDC-IPS e.max(®) CAD; YZW-Zenostar Zr Translucent; PICN-Enamic; YLD-T-IPS e.max(®) ZirCAD + IPS e.max Ceram; CAD-on-Zenostar Zr Translucent + Crystall./Connect + IPS e.max(®) CAD) were fabricated. Specimens (n = 5) were cemented with a resin luting agent (Variolink(®) N; shade White) on three different shades (ND3, ND8 and ND9) of a tooth-colored resin substrate (IPS Natural Die Material). Spectral reflectance and color coordinates were measured using a spectroradiometer under standardized lighting conditions (CIE D65 illumination) and optical geometry 0/45°. Color differences (ΔE(ab)(*) and ΔE(00)) from cemented specimens and CIELAB- and CIEDE2000-based translucency parameter (TP and TP(00)) from non-cemented specimens were calculated. Data was statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests (α = 0.05). ΔE values were also analyzed using perceptibility (PT = 1.22 ΔE(ab)(*) units; 0.81 ΔE(00) units) and acceptability (AT = 2.66 ΔE(ab)(*) units; 1.77 ΔE(00) units) thresholds. RESULTS: The cemented specimens of CAD-on, LDC, YZW and PICN on different substrates (ND3-ND8, ND3-ND9 and ND8-ND9) showed different ΔE(ab)(*) and ΔE(00) values (p ≤ 0.05), which were above AT. YLD-T showed ΔE(ab)(*) and ΔE(00) values below AT for all comparisons. Lowest and highest TP and TP(00) values were obtained for YLD-T and PICN, respectively (p ≤ 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Resin-cemented YLD-T on different tooth-colored substrates showed less translucency as well as smaller color differences (below acceptability threshold), indicating the best masking ability among evaluated systems.",2019,1,0,
426, Repair bond strength of dental computer-aided design/computer-aided manufactured ceramics after different surface treatments,"L. Al-Turki, Y. Merdad, T. A. Abuhaimed, D. Sabbahi, M. Almarshadi and R. Aldabbagh", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the microtensile bond strength of four dental computer-aided design/computer-aided manufactured (CAD/CAM) ceramics after application of four different surface treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four dental CAD/CAM ceramics were tested: feldspathic ceramic (VITABLOCKS-Mark II), polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (VITA ENAMIC), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (VITA SUPRINITY), and yttria-stabilized zirconia (VITA YZ T). Four surface treatments were applied: no treatment, 5% hydrofluoric acid-etching, airborne particle abrasion, and tribochemical silica coating. The ceramic blocks were repaired with nanohybrid composite (Tetric N-Collection). Sixteen test groups of 12 specimens were prepared. After thermocycling, microtensile bond testing was performed. The microtensile strengths values were statistically analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test. RESULTS: Repaired feldspathic and resin polymer-infiltrated ceramic network ceramics demonstrated superior microtensile bond strengths compared to zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate and yttria-stabilized zirconia. Etched feldspathic and polymer-infiltrated ceramic network ceramics had higher bond strength than the untreated groups. Surface treatments did not affect the bond strength of zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate and yttria-stabilized zirconia with the exception of etching, which reduced the bond strength of yttria-stabilized zirconia. CONCLUSION: Feldspathic ceramic and polymer-infiltrated ceramic network were repaired with dental composite after surface etching with hydrofluoric acid. Repair of zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate and yttria-stabilized zirconia did not demonstrate promising results. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Repair of feldspathic ceramic and polymer-infiltrated ceramic network restorations may be a cost-effective means to promote the longevity of dental restorations. However, zirconia and zirconia-reinforced lithium disilicate restorations do not offer such an option.",2020,1,0,
452, Shear Bond Strength of Different CAD/CAM Ceramics: Acid vs Er:YAG Laser Etching,"Y. Hou, R. Shen, L. Chen, Y. Chen, Y. Jiang, J. Li and J. Gao", Photomed Laser Surg," OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Er:YAG laser etching could be an alternative surface treatment to hydrofluoric (HF) acid etching. BACKGROUND: Surface treatment is important to bonding properties and utility times of computer aided design/computer aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) dental ceramics. The traditional method of HF acid etching is harmful to humans if not handled properly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four different CAD/CAM ceramics (Vita Mark II, IPS Empress CAD, IPS e.max CAD, and Vita Enamic) were cut into 72 blocks and divided into 6 groups according to different surface treatments (n = 12): Group A: no treatment; Group B: HF acid; and Group C to F: different Er:YAG laser power settings (300, 400, 500, and 600 mJ). Ten blocks of each group were measured for shear bond strength (SBS) and the failure modes were evaluated; the rest blocks were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: HF acid etching resulted in the highest SBS for Vita Mark II, IPS Empress CAD, and Vita Enamic; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) compared to the second highest group of laser with 600 mJ in IPS Empress CAD. For IPS e.max CAD, the highest SBS was obtained from laser group with 400 mJ. The SBS results were consistent with failure modes and surface characterizations in SEM images. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that Er:YAG laser had little impact on Vita Mark II and Vita Enamic; but proper power settings could be an alternative surface treatment to HF acid etching (600 mJ for IPS Empress CAD and 400 mJ for IPS e.max CAD).",2018,1,0,
517, Torsional strength of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing-fabricated esthetic orthodontic brackets,"N. Alrejaye, R. Pober and R. Giordano Ii", Angle Orthod," OBJECTIVE: To fabricate orthodontic brackets from esthetic materials and determine their fracture resistance during archwire torsion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing technology (Cerec inLab, Sirona) was used to mill brackets with a 0.018 × 0.025-inch slot. Materials used were Paradigm MZ100 and Lava Ultimate resin composite (3M ESPE), Mark II feldspathic porcelain (Vita Zahnfabrik), and In-Ceram YZ zirconia (Vita Zahnfabrik). Ten brackets of each material were subjected to torque by a 0.018 × 0.025-inch stainless steel archwire (G&H) using a specially designed apparatus. The average moments and degrees of torsion necessary to fracture the brackets were determined and compared with those of commercially available alumina brackets, Mystique MB (Dentsply GAC). RESULTS: The YZ brackets were statistically significantly stronger than any other tested material in their resistance to torsion (P < .05). The mean torques at failure ranged from 3467 g.mm for Mark II to 11,902 g.mm for YZ. The mean torsion angles at failure ranged from 15.3° to 40.9°. CONCLUSION: Zirconia had the highest torsional strength among the tested esthetic brackets. Resistance of MZ100 and Lava Ultimate composite resin brackets to archwire torsion was comparable to commercially available alumina ceramic brackets.",2017,0,1,
412, Polymer infiltrated ceramic network structures for resistance to fatigue fracture and wear,"H. El Zhawi, M. R. Kaizer, A. Chughtai, R. R. Moraes and Y. Zhang", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To investigate fatigue fracture resistance and wear behavior of a polymer infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material (ENAMIC, Vita Zahnfabrik). METHODS: Anatomically shaped ENAMIC monolithic crowns were milled using a CAD/CAM system. The crowns were cemented on aged dentin-like composite abutments (Z100, 3M ESPE) with resin-based cement (Vita DUO Cement, Vita). The specimens were subjected to 2 types of fatigue and wear tests: (1) accelerated sliding-contact mouth-motion step-stress fatigue test (n=24) in water; and (2) long-term sliding-contact mouth-motion fatigue/wear test using a clinically relevant load (P=200N, n=8) in water. Failure was designated as chip-off or bulk fracture. Optical and scanning electron microscopes were used to examine the occlusal surface and subsurface damage, as well as to reveal the material's microstructure. In addition, wear volume and depth were measured by X-ray micro-computed tomography. RESULTS: For accelerated mouth-motion step-stress fatigue testing, 3 out of the 24 ENAMIC crowns fractured following cyclic loading up to 1700N. Minor occlusal damage and contact-induced cone cracks were observed in all surviving specimens, but no flexural radial cracks were seen. For long-term mouth-motion fatigue/wear testing under a 200N load in water, a small wear scar without significant cracks was observed in all 8 tested ENAMIC crowns. SIGNIFICANCE: Monolithic CAD/CAM ENAMIC crowns showed superior resistance to sliding-contact fatigue fracture and wear.",2016,1,0,
2, [Color stability of computer aided design and computer aided manufacture composite ceramic/resin cements after accelerated ageing],"L. K. Wang, Y. N. Liu, H. Hui and P. P. Li", Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi," Objective: To investigate the color stability of computer aided design and computer aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) composite ceramic/resin cements after accelerated ageing. Methods: Twelve groups (ten samples each group) were used as experimental groups, which were composed of CAD/CAM composite ceramic of three kinds of thickness (0.50, 0.75, 1.00 mm) (Lava Ultimate) associated with resin cements (Variolink N) of four colors (A1, A3, T, BL1). Another three groups of CAD/CAM composite ceramic/resin cements of three different kinds of thickness (0.50, 0.75, 1.00 mm) were used as control groups (ten samples each group). All samples were put into the xenon lamp ageing instrument to implement accelerated ageing. Spectrophotometers were used to measure the lightness (L(*)), red green color value (a(*)) and blue yellow color value (b(*)) of all samples before and after accelerated ageing process, and the changes of color variation (ΔE) was calculated. The effect of composite ceramic thickness and resin cement color on the changes of color variation (ΔE) before and after the ageing of CAD/CAM composite ceramic/resin cement and whether there was an interaction between them were tested by two-way ANOVA. Results: Before and after accelerated ageing, the ΔE of CAD/CAM composite ceramic/resin cements were <3.3. Two-way ANOVA showed that the thickness of CAD/CAM composite ceramics had an effect on ΔE (F=27.025, P<0.001), and the color of resin cement also had an effect on ΔE (F=15.606, P<0.001), but there was no interaction between them (F=0.534, P=0.829). Conclusions: The thickness of CAD/CAM composite ceramics and the color of resin cements could both affect the color stability of composite ceramic/resin cements combination. However, the resulted color change is within the clinically acceptable range.",2019,1,1,
290, In-vitro fatigue and fracture testing of CAD/CAM-materials in implant-supported molar crowns,"V. Preis, S. Hahnel, M. Behr, L. Bein and M. Rosentritt", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To investigate the fatigue and fracture resistance of different CAD/CAM-materials as implant- or tooth-supported molar crowns with respect to the clinical procedure (screwed/bonded restoration). METHODS: 168 crowns were fabricated from different CAD/CAM-materials (n=8/material): ZLS (zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic; Suprinity, Vita-Zahnfabrik), COB (composite; Brilliant Crios, Coltene), COL (composite; Lava Ultimate, 3M Espe), PMV/PPV (polyether ether ketone (PEEK)+milled composite veneer/composite paste veneer; BioHPP+HIPC veneer/Crealign veneer, Bredent), COH (composite; Block HC, Shofu), and ZIR (zirconia; IPS e.max ZirCAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent) as reference. Three groups were designed simulating the following clinical procedures: (a) chairside procedure ([CHAIR] implant crown bonded to abutment), (b) labside procedure ([LAB] abutment and implant crown bonded in laboratory, screwed chairside), and (c) reference ([TOOTH] crowns bonded on human teeth). Combined thermal cycling and mechanical loading (TCML) were performed simulating a 5-year clinical situation. Fracture force was determined and failures were documented. Data were statistically analyzed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test, one-way-ANOVA; post-hoc-Bonferroni, α=0.05). RESULTS: All crowns of group LAB-PPV showed cracks after TCML. The other groups survived fatigue testing without failures. Fracture forces varied between 921.3N (PPV) and 4817.8N (ZIR) [CHAIR], 978.0N (COH) and 5081.4N (ZIR) [LAB], 746.7N (PPV) and 3313.5N (ZIR) [TOOTH]. Significantly (p<0.05) different fracture values were found between materials in all three groups. Only ZLS crowns provided no significant (p>0.05) differences between the individual groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Different ceramic and resin-based materials partly performed differently in implant or tooth situations. Individual resin-based materials (PPV, COB, COH) were weakened by inserting a screw channel. Most CAD/CAM-materials may be clinically applied in implant-supported crowns without restrictions. ​.",2017,0,1,

Wang", Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi," Objective: To investigate the influence of thermal cycling on the mechanical properties of resin-ceramic composites. Methods: The different groups of resin-ceramic composites A (Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE, USA), B (block HC, Shofu, Japan), C (Hyramic, Upcera, China), D (Vita Enamic, Vita, German), and the feldspar ceramic E (Mark Ⅱ, Vita, German) were included in this study. The properties of these groups (with 30 samples in each group), including flexural strength, flexural modulus and Vickers hardness were tested before and after thermal cycling (0, 10 000 and 20 000 cycles, respectively). The data were statistically analyzed. Results: Before thermal cycling, the flexural strength of groups A, B and C [(166.28±13.78) MPa, (170.21±11.36) MPa and (202.04±16.55) MPa] were higher than those of groups D and E [(137.09±8.83) MPa and (119.35±5.98) MPa], and the flexural modulus [(62.39±3.40) GPa] and Vickers hardness [(406.97±14.73) HV] of E group were higher than those of other groups (P<0.05). The flexural strength, flexural modulus and Vickers hardness of groups D and E did not change after thermal cycling (all P>0.05), while those of groups A, B and C decreased (all P<0.05). Conclusion: After thermal cycling, the mechanical properties of the A, B and C groups decreased, while those of the groups D and E were stable.",2018,1,1,
181, Effects of different etching methods and bonding procedures on shear bond strength of orthodontic metal brackets applied to different CAD/CAM ceramic materials,S. K. Buyuk and A. S. Kucukekenci, Angle Orthod," OBJECTIVE: To investigate the shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic metal brackets applied to different types of ceramic surfaces treated with different etching procedures and bonding agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Monolithic CAD/CAM ceramic specimens (N = 120; n = 40 each group) of feldspathic ceramic Vita Mark II, resin nanoceramic Lava Ultimate, and hybrid ceramic Vita Enamic were fabricated (14 × 12 × 3 mm). Ceramic specimens were separated into four subgroups (n = 10) according to type of surface treatment and bonding onto the ceramic surface. Within each group, four subgroups were prepared by phosphoric acid, hydrofluoric acid, Transbond XT primer, and Clearfill Ceramic primer. Mandibular central incisor metal brackets were bonded with light-cure composite. The SBS data were analyzed using three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD tests. RESULTS: The highest SBS was found in the Vita Enamic group, which is a hybrid ceramic, etched with hydrofluoric acid and applied Transbond XT Adhesive primer (7.28 ± 2.49 MPa). The lowest SBS was found in the Lava Ultimate group, which is a resin nano-ceramic etched with hydrofluoric acid and applied Clearfill ceramic primer (2.20 ± 1.21 MPa). CONCLUSIONS: CAD/CAM material types and bonding procedures affected bond strength ( P < .05), but the etching procedure did not ( P > .05).

Xing", Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi," Objective: To investigate the translucency parameters (TP) and the color parameters of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials for veneer restorations in order to guide clinical practice. Methods: Eleven groups of CAD/CAM materials (A2 shade) were included in this study: IPS e.max CAD HT/LT, IPS Empress CAD HT/LT, Lava(TM) Ultimate HT/LT, VITA SUPRINITY HT/T, VITA ENAMIC HT/T, VITABLOCS Mark Ⅱ, and were named as Group A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K. Each material was designed and milled to disk-shaped specimens (10.0 mm×8.0 mm×0.7 mm) (n=6). The specimens were polished with silicon carbide paper and the thickness of specimens were adjusted into (0.60±0.03) mm. The color parameters of specimens were individually measured with the colorimeter against black and white ceramic tiles background to obtain the TP values. The color parameters of the specimens against the composite resin background were also measured and the color differences (ΔE values) between specimens and the A2 shade tab were calculated. Results: One-way ANOVA showed that the translucency parameters of the 11 groups of materials were statistically significant (F=253.69, P<0.05). The ΔE values of CAD/CAM material groups ranged from 1.78 to 4.12 (ΔE values<5.5).

17, A comparative study on the wear behavior of a polymer infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material and tooth enamel,"Z. Xu, P. Yu, D. D. Arola, J. Min and S. Gao", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To investigate the wear mechanisms of a polymer infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material, to compare its wear behavior with that of tooth enamel, and to provide evidence relevant to its clinical use. METHODS: The Vickers hardness (HV) and elastic modulus (E) of a commercial PICN material (ENAMIC) and enamel were measured. Reciprocating wear tests were performed under a ball-on-flat configuration. Three wear pairs were explored including ENAMIC and enamel subjected to Si(3)N(4) ball antagonists and ENAMIC subjected to enamel cusp antagonists. The coefficients of Friction (CoFs) were monitored continuously to 5×10(4) cycles. The wear depth of ENAMIC, enamel specimens and enamel cusps were quantified using white light interferometry, and the wear morphologies were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to distinguish the wear mechanisms. RESULTS: The HV of ENAMIC is similar to tooth enamel but the E is much lower. For both materials, the CoFs increased sharply in the early stage and then reached plateaus in the later phase. Throughout the cyclic loading history, ENAMIC exhibited larger wear depths than enamel. However, the damage evolution in ENAMIC was similar to that of enamel as the polymer phase was worn preferentially similar to inter-rod enamel, and then the ceramic phase exfoliated from the wear surface akin to enamel rods. The SEM images showed evidence of few cracks within wear tracks of ENAMIC, in comparison to numerous cracks in tooth enamel. SIGNIFICANCE: ENAMIC has lower wear resistance than tooth enamel, but it exhibits a wear damage mode similar to tooth enamel.",2017,1,0,
459, Size or hierarchical dependence of the elastic modulus of three ceramic-composite CAD/CAM materials,"R. A. Al-Shatti, G. H. Dashti, S. Philip, S. Michael and M. V. Swain", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To measure the elastic modulus of three ceramic-composite CAD/CAM materials at three different microstructural dimensions: macro, micro, and nano. METHODS: Three novel ceramic-composite CAD/CAM materials (Enamic, Lava Ultimate, and Cerasmart) were investigated. Rectangular cross-sections 10 × 5.7 × 1 mm(3) (n = 30) were cut from standard sized milling blocks of each material prior to polishing. Specimens were macro-tested using three-point bending and with a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), micro-tested using a nano-indentation system, and finally at the nano-level with an atomic force microscope (AFM). Data were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA (α = 0.05). RESULTS: At the macro level Enamic showed the highest elastic modulus, followed by Lava Ultimate and Cerasmart respectively (p < 0.001). Measurements at the micro and nano level resulted in bimodal distributions of the elastic modulus values associated with the various phases present with values higher and lower than measured at the macro level. Only at the nano-level were the various phases of Cerasmart able to be distinguished. CONCLUSIONS: The tested materials showed different elastic modulus at the different size or hierarchical levels that enabled comparison with the hierarchical values of enamel. SIGNIFICANCE: Studying the mechanical properties of these novel materials at different size or hierarchical scales can help to understand their potential clinical performance, such as structural durability and opposing tooth wear and lead to more biomimetic like dental restorative materials.",2019,1,1,
532," Wear, strength, modulus and hardness of CAD/CAM restorative materials","N. C. Lawson, R. Bansal and J. O. Burgess", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVE: To measure the mechanical properties of several CAD/CAM materials, including lithium disilicate (e.max CAD), lithium silicate/zirconia (Celtra Duo), 3 resin composites (Cerasmart, Lava Ultimate, Paradigm MZ100), and a polymer infiltrated ceramic (Enamic). METHODS: CAD/CAM blocks were sectioned into 2.5mm×2.5mm×16mm bars for flexural strength and elastic modulus testing and 4mm thick blocks for hardness and wear testing. E.max CAD and half the Celtra Duo specimens were treated in a furnace. Flexural strength specimens (n=10) were tested in a three-point bending fixture. Vickers microhardness (n=2, 5 readings per specimen) was measured with a 1kg load and 15s dwell time. The CAD/CAM materials as well as labial surfaces of human incisors were mounted in the UAB wear device. Cusps of human premolars were mounted as antagonists. Specimens were tested for 400,000 cycles at 20N force, 2mm sliding distance, 1Hz frequency, 24°C, and 33% glycerin lubrication. Volumetric wear and opposing enamel wear were measured with non-contact profilometry. Data were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc analysis (alpha=0.05). Specimens were observed with SEM. RESULTS: Properties were different for each material (p<0.01). E.max CAD and Celtra Duo were generally stronger, stiffer, and harder than the other materials. E.max CAD, Celtra Duo, Enamic, and enamel demonstrated signs of abrasive wear, whereas Cerasmart, Lava Ultimate, Paradigm MZ100 demonstrated signs of fatigue. SIGNIFICANCE: Resin composite and resin infiltrated ceramic materials have demonstrated adequate wear resistance for load bearing restorations, however, they will require at least similar material thickness as lithium disilicate restorations due to their strength.",2016,1,1,

Bayrak", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVE: While the radiopacity of restorative material affects the radiographic diagnosis of the teeth, there is no data about the radiopacity of current restorative computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) materials. Therefore, the present study compared the radiopacity values of current restorative CAD/CAM blocks to facilitate the material choice within such a wide variety of materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens were prepared from 13 different restorative CAD/CAM blocks to compare with enamel and dentin. The specimens placed on the occlusal phosphor plate were imaged with aluminum step wedge and tooth section. The radiopacity values were calculated using the Image J program. The radiopacity values of the specimens were converted to mmAl values with the Curve Expert 1.4 program. RESULTS: The difference between the radiopacity values of dentin and e.max CAD was not significant, however, they exhibited a significant difference from the other 14 groups (P < .05). Enamel and Obsidien, Suprinity, and Celtra Duo had greater radiopacity values with significant differences from the other 12 materials whereas the difference within these groups was not significant (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated restorative CAD/CAM materials have significantly different radiopacity values. Among these permanent restoration blocks, the highest radiopacity value was observed in Celtra Duo, the lowest in Block HC. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Cerasmart, Lava Ultimate, Obsidian, Vita Suprinity, Celtra Duo Blocks have adequate radiopacity for inlay, onlay and crown restorations, however, the use of Vita Enamic, Vita Mark II, GC LRF blocks and the others which have lower radiopacity value than dentin for the same kind of restorations depend on the radiopacity of the luting cement for the purpose of recurrent caries detection.",2019,0,0,
463, Stability of endodontically treated teeth with differently invasive restorations: Adhesive vs. non-adhesive cusp stabilization,"R. Frankenberger, I. Zeilinger, M. Krech, G. Mörig, M. Naumann, A. Braun, N. Krämer and M. J. Roggendorf", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: Aim of the present study was to evaluate fracture strength of endodontically treated molars with different preparations/restorations after thermomechanical loading in vitro. METHODS: 264 extracted human third molars were used. Beside the control group, 256 teeth in 32 test groups (n=8) received root canal treatment (MTwo #40/.6) and root canal obturation with AH Plus and Guttapercha. After postendodontic sealing and build-up (Syntac, SDR), specimens were additionally prepared MO or MOD. Postendodontic restorations were: Direct restorations (Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill bonded with Syntac; as filling or direct partial crown (PC) after reducing the cusps 3mm; amalgam as filling or direct pin-retained partial crown (PC)), vs. indirect adhesive restorations (I: Inlay vs. PC; IPS Empress I/PC; Celtra Duo I/PC; e.max CAD I/PC; Lava Ultimate I/PC; Enamic I/PC - all inserted with Syntac/Variolink) vs. cemented cast gold I/PC. After 300,000 thermocycles (5/55°C) and 1.2 Mio. 100N load cycles, specimens were loaded until fracture. RESULTS: Whereas IPS Empress showed no difference between I and PC (p>0.05), in all other groups PC were significantly more stable than fillings/inlays (p<0.05), this effect was more pronounced after MOD preparations. Cast gold PC exhibited the highest fracture strengths (p<0.05), inlays the lowest (p<0.05). IPS Empress was generally inferior to the other bonded materials under investigation (p<0.05) which as PC almost reached the level of control specimens. Amalgam fillings showed the worst outcome (p<0.05). SIGNIFICANCES: Less invasive preparation designs were not beneficial for the stability of postendodontic restorations. Except for IPS Empress, PC were generally more successful in restabilization of weakened cusps after endodontic treatment and preparation. Cast gold PC remain the ultimate stabilization tool for ETT in terms of fracture resistance.",2015,0,0,
52, Bonding to new CAD/CAM resin composites: influence of air abrasion and conditioning agents as pretreatment strategy,"M. Reymus, M. Roos, M. Eichberger, D. Edelhoff, R. Hickel and B. Stawarczyk", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: Because of their industrially standardized process of manufacturing, CAD/CAM resin composites show a high degree of conversion, making a reliable bond difficult to achieve. PURPOSE: The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the tensile bond strength (TBS) of luting composite to CAD/CAM resin composite materials as influenced by air abrasion and pretreatment strategies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The treatment factors of the present study were (1) brand of the CAD/CAM resin composite (Brilliant Crios [Coltene/Whaledent], Cerasmart [GC Europe], Shofu Block HC [Shofu], and Lava Ultimate [3M]); (2) air abrasion vs. no air abrasion; and (3) pretreatment using a silane primer (Clearfil Ceramic Primer, Kuraray) vs. a resin primer (One Coat 7 Universal, Coltene/Whaledent). Subsequently, luting composite (DuoCem, Coltene/Whaledent) was polymerized onto the substrate surface using a mold. For each combination of the levels of the three treatment factors (4 (materials) × 2 (air abrasion vs. no air abrasion; resin) × 2 (primer vs. silane primer)), n = 15, specimens were prepared. After 24 h of water storage at 37 °C and 5000 thermo-cycles (5/55 °C), TBS was measured and failure types were examined. The resulting data was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative failure distribution function with Breslow-Gehan tests and non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test) followed by the multiple pairwise Mann-Whitney U test with α-error adjustment using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and chi-square test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The additional air abrasion step increased TBS values and lowered failure rates. Specimens pretreated using a resin primer showed significantly higher TBS and lower failure rates than those pretreated using a silane primer. The highest failure rates were observed for groups pretreated with a silane primer. Within the Shofu Block HC group, all specimens without air abrasion and pretreatment with a silane primer debonded during the aging procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Before fixation of CAD/CAM resin composites, the restorations should be air abraded and pretreated using a resin primer containing methyl-methacrylate to successfully bond to the luting composite. The pretreatment of the CAD/CAM resin composite using merely a silane primer results in deficient adhesion. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: For a reliable bond of CAD/CAM resin composites to the luting composite, air abrasion and a special pretreatment strategy are necessary in order to achieve promising long-term results.",2019,0,1,
521, Transmission of light in the visible spectrum (400-700 nm) and blue spectrum (360-540 nm) through CAD/CAM polymers,"J. F. Güth, A. E. C. Kauling, K. Ueda, B. Florian and M. Stimmelmayr", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: CAD/CAM-fabricated long-term temporary restorations from high-density polymers can be applied for a wide range of indications. Milled from monolithic, mono-colored polymer blocks, the translucency of the material plays an important role for an esthetically acceptable result. The aim of this study was to compare the transmittance through visible light and blue light of CAD CAM polymers to a glass-ceramic material of the same color. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ambarino High-Class (AM), Telio-CAD (TC), Zenotec PMMA (ZT), Cercon base PMMA (CB), CAD Temp (CT), Artbloc Temp (AT), Polycon ae (PS), New Outline CAD (NC), QUATTRO DISK Eco PMMA (GQ), Lava Ultimate (LU), and Paradigm MZ 100 (PA) were employed in this study using the feldspathic glass-ceramic Vita Mark II (MK) as control group. Using a spectrophotometer, the overall light transmittance was measured for each material (n = 40) and was calculated as the integration (t (c) (λ) dλ [10(-5)]) of all t (c) values for the wavelengths of blue light (360-540 nm). Results were compared to previous data of the authors for visible light (400 to 700 nm). RESULTS: Wilcoxon test showed significant differences between the light transmittance of visible and blue light for all materials. CONCLUSION: CAD/CAM polymers showed different translucency for blue and visible light. This means clinicians may not conclude from the visible translucency of a material to its permeability for blue light. This influences considerations regarding light curing. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CAD/CAM polymers need to be luted adhesively; therefore, clinicians should be aware about the amount of blue light passing through a restoration.",2016,0,0,
62, Chairside CAD/CAM materials. Part 3: Cyclic fatigue parameters and lifetime predictions,"M. Wendler, R. Belli, D. Valladares, A. Petschelt and U. Lohbauer", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: Chemical and mechanical degradation play a key role on the lifetime of dental restorative materials. Therefore, prediction of their long-term performance in the oral environment should base on fatigue, rather than inert strength data, as commonly observed in the dental material's field. The objective of the present study was to provide mechanistic fatigue parameters of current dental CAD/CAM materials under cyclic biaxial flexure and assess their suitability in predicting clinical fracture behaviors. METHODS: Eight CAD/CAM materials, including polycrystalline zirconia (IPS e.max ZirCAD), reinforced glasses (Vitablocs Mark II, IPS Empress CAD), glass-ceramics (IPS e.max CAD, Suprinity PC, Celtra Duo), as well as hybrid materials (Enamic, Lava Ultimate) were evaluated. Rectangular plates (12×12×1.2mm(3)) with highly polished surfaces were prepared and tested in biaxial cyclic fatigue in water until fracture using the Ball-on-Three-Balls (B3B) test. Cyclic fatigue parameters n and A* were obtained from the lifetime data for each material and further used to build SPT diagrams. The latter were used to compare in-vitro with in-vivo fracture distributions for IPS e.max CAD and IPS Empress CAD. RESULTS: Susceptibility to subcritical crack growth under cyclic loading was observed for all materials, being more severe (n≤20) in lithium-based glass-ceramics and Vitablocs Mark II. Strength degradations of 40% up to 60% were predicted after only 1 year of service. Threshold stress intensity factors (K(th)) representing the onset of subcritical crack growth (SCG), were estimated to lie in the range of 0.37-0.44 of K(Ic) for the lithium-based glass-ceramics and Vitablocs Mark II and between 0.51-0.59 of K(Ic) for the other materials. Failure distributions associated with mechanistic estimations of strength degradation in-vitro showed to be useful in interpreting failure behavior in-vivo. The parameter K(th) stood out as a better predictor of clinical performance in detriment to the SCG n parameter. SIGNIFICANCE: Fatigue parameters obtained from cyclic loading experiments are more reliable predictors of the mechanical performance of contemporary dental CAD/CAM restoratives than quasi-static mechanical properties.",2018,0,0,
232, Fractography of clinical failures of indirect resin composite endocrown and overlay restorations,"C. M. Saratti, G. T. Rocca, S. Durual, U. Lohbauer, J. L. Ferracane and S. S. Scherrer", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: Compare failure modes and fracture origins using fractography on recovered clinically fractured parts of indirect resin composite endocrowns and overlay restorations on endodontically treated teeth (ETT). METHODS: Four endocrowns (3 molars, 1 premolar) and one overlay (molar) adhesively luted on ETT were recovered after fracturing during function. The time in service ranged between 4 and 48 months. The composite materials were (i) CAD/CAM LAVA Ultimate (N = 1), (ii) Premise Indirect (N = 2), and (iii) Colombus (N = 2). Fractography was performed by means of digital microscopy and SEM. Occlusal surfaces were checked for signs of fatigue degradation and contact wear. Cuspal plane angles were measured from profiles obtained from 3D digital microscope images with respect to the horizontal plane of the occlusal central crown groove. RESULTS: All five cases showed a wedge-opening mode I fracture, splitting the crown and tooth in two parts through the crown's central groove. Classic brittle fracture features (arrest lines, twist and wake hackle) were easily identified on the fracture surfaces. Multiple origins were located along the central groove in conjunction with the presence of fatigue cracks. Contact wear surfaces showed pitting and cracking. Cuspal plane angles were around 30-35°, except a 50° palatal cusp slope for the Lava Ultimate overlay. SIGNIFICANCE: Fractography on clinical fractures of resin composites was enlightening. Occlusal surface fatigue degradation from cyclic loading, mode I fracture from applied mastication forces on cuspal planes, and stress concentration within the crown's central groove, indicate limitations of use of these materials for endocrowns in posterior teeth.",2021,0,1,
136, Effect of different surface treatment techniques on the repair strength of indirect composites,"B. A. Loomans, M. E. Mesko, R. R. Moraes, J. Ruben, E. M. Bronkhorst, T. Pereira-Cenci and M. C. Huysmans", J Dent," OBJECTIVES: Composite resin restorations present high survival rates and when a failure occurs repair is often possible. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of various repair techniques on indirect restorations. METHODS: LAVA Ultimate (3M), and Clearfil Estenia blocks (Kuraray) were repaired with our without surface roughness treatments, silane application and artificial ageing. Micro-shear bond stress tests were performed, while cohesive strength served as positive control. ANOVA was used for cohesive strength and effect of ageing, and linear mixed models to evaluate the effect of treatment variables on repair strength. RESULTS: Both materials reacted differently on surface treatments. Untreated (no treatment, no silane) repair strength was 16.3±6.3MPa for LAVA Ultimate and 19.0±4.3MPa for Estenia. Thermal cycling resulted in a 14-58% reduction of cohesive strength. Without cycling, all treatments resulted in a significant increase of bond strength in LAVA Ultimate (p<0.003). After cycling use of air-abrasion showed a positive trend for both substrates, significantly effective for LAVA Ultimate (p<0.04), and silane and CoJet for Estenia (p<0.024). The positive effect of HF treatment disappeared after cycling. CONCLUSION: It may be concluded that (1) the effect of surface treatment procedures on the repair bond strength of indirect composites is depended on the substrate and ageing. (2) Silane did not have a clear overall positive effect on bond strength and (3) artificial ageing had a strong negative influence on the stability of the adhesive interface and on the cohesive strength of one indirect composite resin material, but not the other.",2017,0,1,
487, The effect of ceramic thickness on opalescence,"S. Valizadeh, A. Mahmoudi Nahavandi, M. Daryadar, M. Özcan and S. S. Hashemikamangar", Clin Exp Dent Res," OBJECTIVES: Creating a tooth-like appearance by use of dental ceramics is still a challenge. Opalescence is a unique property of dental enamel, attempted to be mimicked by dental restorative materials. This study aimed to assess the effect of ceramic thickness on opalescence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four discs were fabricated of feldspathic ceramic, IPS e.max, zirconia and Enamic ceramics with 10 mm diameter and 0.5 and 1 mm thicknesses (n = 12). The opalescence of ceramic specimens was calculated by measuring the difference in yellow-blue axis (CIE ∆b*) and red-green axis (CIE ∆a*) between the transmitted and reflected spectra. One-way ANOVA was applied to compare the opalescence of different ceramic specimens with variable thicknesses at .05 level of significance. RESULTS: The opalescence of feldspathic, IPS e.max, zirconia and Enamic ceramic specimens with 0.5 mm thickness was 1.06 ± 0.15, 3.39 ± 0.15, 1.98 ± 0.15 and 1.44 ± 0.15, respectively. By increasing the thickness to 1 mm, the opalescence of feldspathic, IPS e.max, zirconia and Enamic ceramics changed to 1.12 ± 0.15, 1.47 ± 0.15, 3.85 ± 0.15 and 2.00 ± 0.15, respectively. In all groups except for IPS e.max, the mean opalescence of 1-mm-thick specimens was higher than that of 0.5-mm-thick specimens. CONCLUSION: Type and thickness of ceramic affect its opalescence. The opalescence of all ceramic specimens tested in this study with 0.5 and 1 mm thicknesses was lower than that of the enamel.",2020,1,0,
355, Material properties and fractography of an indirect dental resin composite,J. B. Quinn and G. D. Quinn, Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: Determination of material and fractographic properties of a dental indirect resin composite material. METHODS: A resin composite (Paradigm, 3M-ESPE, MN) was characterized by strength, static elastic modulus, Knoop hardness, fracture toughness and edge toughness. Fractographic analyses of the broken bar surfaces was accomplished with a combination of optical and SEM techniques, and included determination of the type and size of the failure origins, and fracture mirror and branching constants. RESULTS: The flexure test mean strength+/-standard deviation was 145+/-17 MPa, and edge toughness, T(e), was 172+/-12N/mm. Knoop hardness was load dependent, with a plateau at 0.99+/-0.02 GPa. Mirrors in the bar specimens were measured with difficulty, resulting in a mirror constant of approximately 2.6 MPa m(1/2). Fracture in the bar specimens initiated at equiaxed material flaws that had different filler concentrations that sometimes were accompanied by partial microcracks. Using the measured flaw sizes, which ranged from 35 to 100 microm in size, and using estimates of the stress intensity shape factors, fracture toughness was estimated to be 1.1+/-0.2 MPa m(1/2). SIGNIFICANCE: Coupling the flexure tests with fractographic examination enabled identification of the intrinsic strength limiting flaws. The same techniques could be useful in determining if clinical restorations of similar materials fail from the same causes. The existence of a strong load-dependence of the Knoop hardness of the resin composite is not generally mentioned in the literature, and is important for material comparisons and wear evaluation studies. Finally, the edge toughness test was found promising as a quantitative measure of resistance to edge chipping, an important failure mode in this class of materials.",2010,0,1,
360, Mechanical fatigue degradation of ceramics versus resin composites for dental restorations,"R. Belli, E. Geinzer, A. Muschweck, A. Petschelt and U. Lohbauer", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: For posterior partial restorations an overlap of indication exists where either ceramic or resin-based composite materials can be successfully applied. The aim of this study was to compare the fatigue resistance of modern dental ceramic materials versus dental resin composites in order to address such conflicts. METHODS: Bar specimens of five ceramic materials and resin composites were produced according to ISO 4049 and stored for 14 days in distilled water at 37°C. The following ceramic materials were selected for testing: a high-strength zirconium dioxide (e.max ZirCAD, Ivoclar), a machinable lithium disilicate (e.max CAD, Ivoclar), a pressable lithium disilicate ceramic (e-max Press, Ivoclar), a fluorapatite-based glass-ceramic (e.max Ceram, Ivoclar), and a machinable color-graded feldspathic porcelain (Trilux Forte, Vita). The composite materials selected were: an indirect machinable composite (Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE) and four direct composites with varying filler nature (Clearfil Majesty Posterior, Kuraray; GrandioSO, Voco; Tetric EvoCeram, Ivoclar-Vivadent; and CeramX Duo, Dentsply). Fifteen specimens were tested in water for initial strength (σin) in 4-point bending. Using the same test set-up, the residual flexural fatigue strength (σff) was determined using the staircase approach after 10(4) cycles at 0.5 Hz (n=25). Weibull parameters σ0 and m were calculated for the σin specimens, whereas the σff and strength loss in percentage were obtained from the fatigue experiment. RESULTS: The zirconium oxide ceramic showed the highest σin and σff (768 and 440 MPa, respectively). Although both lithium disilicate ceramics were similar in the static test, the pressable version showed a significantly higher fatigue resistance after cyclic loading. Both the fluorapatite-based and the feldspathic porcelain showed equivalent initial and cyclic fatigue properties. From the composites, the highest filled direct material Clearfil Majesty Posterior showed superior fatigue performance. From all materials, e.max Press and Clearfil Majesty Posterior showed the lowest strength loss (29.6% and 32%, respectively), whereas the other materials lost between 41% and 62% of their flexural strength after cyclic loading. CONCLUSIONS: Dental ceramics and resin composite materials show equivalent fatigue strength degradation at loads around 0.5σin values. Apart from the zirconium oxide and the lithium disilicate ceramics, resin composites generally showed better σff after 10,000 cycles than the fluorapatite glass-ceramic and the feldspathic porcelain. Resin composite restorations may be used as an equivalent alternative to glass-rich-ceramic inlays regarding mechanical performance.",2014,0,1,
235, Fracture load of CAD/CAM-fabricated and 3D-printed composite crowns as a function of material thickness,"M. Zimmermann, A. Ender, G. Egli, M. Özcan and A. Mehl", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: Indirect CAD/CAM restorations can be fabricated using both subtractive and additive CAD/CAM technology. This study investigated the fracture load of crowns fabricated from three particle-filled composite CAD/CAM materials and one 3D-printed composite material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lava Ultimate, Cerasmart and Brilliant Crios were used as particle-filled composite CAD/CAM material and els-3D Harz as 3D-printed composite material. For each group, crowns with three different material thicknesses (0.5/1.0/1.5 mm) were fabricated. Control group was composed of ceramic-based CAD/CAM materials e.max CAD and Enamic. Totally, n = 180 crowns were fabricated and adhesively seated on SLA fabricated dies. Thermomechanical loading and fracture testing were performed. The data for fracture loading force were statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed with multiple comparisons by post hoc Tukey's test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: In contrast to ceramics, all particle-filled composite crowns with 0.5-mm thickness survived fatigue testing. Forces varied statistically significantly. Brilliant Crios showed highest maximum loading force with 1580.4 ± 521.0 N (1.5 mm). Two-way ANOVA indicated that both the material and the thickness affected the fracture load (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Particle-filled composite resin CAD/CAM materials may have advantageous material characteristics compared to ceramic CAD/CAM materials for minimal restoration thicknesses. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Composite-based CAD/CAM materials may offer new possibilities in minimally invasive restorative treatment concepts.",2019,0,1,
391, Monomer release from direct and indirect adhesive restorations: A comparative in vitro study,"E. Putzeys, C. Vercruyssen, R. C. Duca, P. S. Saha, L. Godderis, J. Vanoirbeek, M. Peumans, B. Van Meerbeek and K. L. Van Landuyt", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: Indirect dental restorations produced by computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) are relatively new in daily dental practice. The aim of the present study was to compare the monomer release between direct composite restorations and indirect CAD/CAM produced restorations (composite, ceramic and hybrid). METHODS: Identical crown restorations were prepared from three indirect materials (Cerasmart, Vitablocs Mark II and Vita Enamic) and one composite material (Clearfil AP-X). For each restoration, eight crown restorations were luted onto tooth samples and immersed into 2.5mL of an aqueous extraction solvent. Additionally, three nonluted crowns of each restoration type were also immersed in the extraction solvent, and served as controls. Every week, the extraction solvent was collected and refreshed, during a period of 8 weeks. The released monomers were quantified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Indirect restorations release significantly lower quantities of residual monomers than direct restorations, and the monomers released by the luted indirect restorations are mainly derived from the composite material used for cementation. The quantity of monomers released by direct restorations greatly depended on the time of light polymerization. SIGNIFICANCE: In terms of monomer release, indirect restorations are a good alternative to direct restorations to limit patient exposure to residual monomers. It is important to ideally design the fit of indirect restoration so that the cement layer is as thin as possible and the monomer release from this cement layer remains as low as possible.",2020,0,1,
37, Biofilm formation on restorative materials and resin composite cements,"M. Astasov-Frauenhoffer, S. Glauser, J. Fischer, F. Schmidli, T. Waltimo and N. Rohr", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: Monolithic zirconia, polymer-infiltrated ceramic and acrylate polymer cemented with resin composite cement have recently been identified as prosthetic treatment options for zirconia implants. The aim of the present study is to determine in vitro, to what extent bacteria adhere to these materials. METHODS: Disks made of zirconia (Vita YZ [YZ]), polymer-infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic [VE]), acrylate polymer (Vita CAD-Temp [CT]), self-adhesive cement (RelyX Unicem 2 Automix [RUN]) and of two different adhesive cements (RelyX Ulimate [RUL] and Vita Adiva F-Cem [VAF]) were produced. The biofilm formation of three bacterial species (Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis) on each material was assessed over 72h using a flow chamber system. The biofilms were quantified by crystal violet staining (optical density 595nm) and visualized using SEM. The inorganic composition of the different materials was analyzed and the wettability of the specimens was measured. RESULTS: For the restorative materials lowest biofilm formation was found on CT: OD 0.5±0.1, followed by VE: OD 0.8±0.1 and YZ: OD 1.4±0.3. The biofilm formation on resin composite cements was significantly lower on VAF: OD 0.6±0.1 than for RUL: OD 0.9±0.1 and RUN: OD 1.0±0.1. A high wettability of the specimens with saliva/serum mixture tended to result in a higher biofilm formation. Correlations were obtained between the organic/inorganic composition of the materials and the polar/dispersive part of the surface free energy. SIGNIFICANCE: Three-species biofilm formation on restorative and cement materials strongly relies on the materials composition. If the restorative material CT and cement VAF also prevent excessive biofilm formation in a clinical situation should be further investigated.",2018,1,0,
100, Damping behavior of implant-supported restorations,"P. Magne, M. Silva, E. Oderich, L. L. Boff and R. Enciso", Clin Oral Implants Res," OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the shock absorbing capacity of implant-supported restorations (CAD/CAM composite resin or zirconia abutment with composite resin or porcelain crown/onlay) and a simulated natural tooth complex using the Periometer(®) . MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty Morse taper implants (Titamax CM 11 mm) were mounted on bone-simulating acrylic resin base and restored with CAD/CAM zirconia (60) and metal composite resin Paradigm MZ100 (60) abutments. Using CEREC3, standardized onlays (60) and crowns (60) were designed and milled in ceramic (Paradigm C) or composite resin (Paradigm MZ100) to simulate a maxillary premolar. All restorations were luted with a preheated light curing composite resin (Filtek Z100). Fifteen extracted human upper premolars were mounted with a simulated PDL and used as control group. The Periometer(®) , a new handheld percussion probe that measures the energy loss coefficient (LC) for both natural teeth and implant-supported structures, was positioned perpendicularly to the buccal surface of each restoration. Three measurements of the LC were collected for each specimen. The effect of each variable (abutment material, restoration material, and restoration design) on the LC was explored using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Differences in LC between the abutment material (zirconia/Paradigm MZ100), the restoration material (Paradigm C/Paradigm MZ100) and the restoration design (onlay/crown) were recorded. The average LC of zirconia and metal composite resin abutments ranged from 0.040 to 0.053 and 0.059 to 0.068, respectively. Zirconia abutments restored with composite resin restorations (LC 0.051-0.053) had the closest LC value when compared with teeth with simulated PDL (0.049). CONCLUSION: Composite resin onlays/crowns bonded to zirconia implant abutments presented similar dynamic response to load (damping behavior) when compared to teeth with a simulated PDL.",2013,0,1,
234, Fracture force of CAD/CAM resin composite crowns after in vitro aging,"M. Rosentritt, S. Krifka, T. Strasser and V. Preis", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of material, preparation, and pre-treatment on the aging and fracture force of CAD/CAM resin composite molar crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAD/CAM molar crowns (n = 80) were milled from four resin composites (Block HC, Shofu; Lava Ultimate, 3 M; Grandio Blocs, Voco; and Tetric CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent, with/without sandblasting). Extracted human teeth were prepared with optimal preparation (height 6-8 mm, angle 6-8°) or worst-case preparation (height 3.5-4 mm, angle 10-15°). Both groups were prepared with a 1-mm deep cervical circular shoulder. Crowns were adhesively bonded after corresponding tooth treatment required for the individual adhesive systems (Table 1). Specimens were aged for 90 days in water storage (37 °C) and subsequently subjected to thermal cycling and mechanical loading (TCML 3000 × 5 °C/3000 × 55 °C, 2 min each cycle, H20 distilled; 1.2 × 10(6) cycles à 50 N, 1.6 Hz). De-bonding and fracture force was determined. STATISTICS: one-way-ANOVA; post hoc Bonferroni, α = 0.05. RESULTS: Four crowns of Lava Ultimate with worst-case preparation de-bonded during TCML. Individual crowns without sandblasting treatment (3x Tetric CAD with optimal preparation; 1x Tetric CAD with worst-case preparation) de-bonded during water storage. One crown of Grandio Blocs with optimal preparation showed a small chipping during TCML. All other crowns survived TCML and water storage without failure. Fracture forces differed between 1272 ± 211 N (Lava Ultimate) and 3061 ± 521 N (Tetric CAD). All Grandio Blocs and Tetric CAD crowns revealed significantly (p ≤ 0.023) higher fracture forces than Block HC or Lava Ultimate crowns. No significantly different (p > 0.05) fracture forces were found between optimal or worst-case preparation/fit groups. CONCLUSIONS: De-bonding during water storage and TCML was dependent on material and crown pre-treatment. Therefore, surface roughening seems strongly required. Fracture forces were not influenced by preparation but by the type of material. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinical success and de-bonding of CAD/CAM resin composite crowns is strongly influenced by the type of material and its pre-treatment.",2020,0,1,
212, Evaluation of two CAD/CAM materials for Nayyar core and post-retained restorations: Three dimensional stress analysis,N. Ulusoy and L. Gulec Alagoz, J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the stress distribution of a nanoceramic resin CAD/CAM material, Lava Ultimate (LU) and a polymer-infiltrated hybrid ceramic CAD/CAM material, Vita Enamic (VE) for enamel replacement for Nayyar core (corono-radicular dowel and core) or post-retained restoration designs of a maxillary first premolar tooth with missing palatal cusp. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three dimensional finite element (FE) modelof maxillary first premolar with two roots was modeled. A mesial-occlusal-distal-palatal (MODP) cavity was designed with cavity floor above cemento-enamel junction and including buccal cuspal reduction. Restoration designs consisted of Nayyar core restoration (NCR) and post-retained restoration (PRR) with a glass fiber post. Vita Enamic (VE), Lava Ultimate (LU) were used for enamel and everX Posterior was used for dentin replacement. Vertical occlusal load (100 N) was applied on a spherical solid rigid material simulating the food stuff. Von Mises (VM) and maximum principle stress values were evaluated separately for the remaining enamel, remaining dentin and restorative material in megapascal (MPa). RESULTS: The analysis of both VM and maximum principle stress values revealed that the most intense stress accumulation was in the cervical region of enamel for both designs. For VM, similar stress values were observed only in dentin. Stress analysis of restorative materials showed that everX Posterior had the highest stress accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of the two techniques showed that PRR had better stress distribution than NCR. NCR or PRR with LU or VE exhibited similar VM stress accumulation in dentin. Maximum principle stress analyses showed that PRR with LU transmitted the least stress to enamel and dentin indicating that when LU is the material of choice, post-retained restoration would be a satisfactory design. VM stress values of enamel revealed that VE absorbed the stress in itself and transferred less stress to dentin. This could point out that for the restoration of maxillary first premolar tooth with missing palatal cusp, VE may be a suitable material for NCR and PRR restoration techniques. HIGHLIGHTS: When fiber reinforced composite is used as dentin replacement in combination with VE as enamel replacement; any technique; PRR or NCR, may be preferred in the restoration of MODP cavities of endodontically treated maxillary premolars. The clinical relevance has to be further studied in-vivo.",2021,1,0,
287, In vitro performance and fracture resistance of CAD/CAM-fabricated implant supported molar crowns,"M. Rosentritt, S. Hahnel, F. Engelhardt, M. Behr and V. Preis", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate the performance and fracture resistance of different CAD/CAM ceramic and composite materials as implant- or tooth-supported single crowns with respect to the clinical procedure (screwed/bonded restoration). MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty crowns were fabricated on implants or human molar teeth simulating (a) chairside procedure ([CHAIR] implant crown bonded to abutment), (b) labside procedure ([LAB] abutment and implant crown bonded in laboratory, screwed chairside), and (c) reference ([TOOTH] crowns luted on human teeth). Four materials were investigated: ZLS (zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic; Celtra Duo, Degudent: polished (P)/crystallized (C)), RB (resin-based composite; Cerasmart, GC), and RIC (resin-infiltrated ceramic; Enamic, Vita-Zahnfabrik). LiS (lithiumdisilicate; Emax CAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent) served as reference. Combined thermal cycling and mechanical loading (TCML) was performed simulating a 5-year clinical situation. Fracture force was determined. Data were statistically analyzed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, one-way ANOVA; post hoc Bonferroni, α = 0.05). RESULTS: One crown of ZLS_C[LAB] (1,200,000 cycles) and RB[CHAIR] (890 cycles) failed during TCML. Fracture values varied between 977.7 N(RB) and 3070.4 N(LiS)[CHAIR], 1130.6 N(RB) and 2998.1 N(LiS)[LAB], and 1802.4 N(ZLS) and 2664.3 N(LiS)[TOOTH]. Significantly (p < 0.003) different forces were found between the materials in all three groups. ZLS_C, RIC, and RB showed significantly (p < 0.014) different values for the individual groups. CONCLUSIONS: Partly ceramic and resin-based materials performed differently on implant or tooth abutments. The insertion of a screw channel reduced the stability for individual crown materials. Insertion of the screw channel should be performed carefully. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: All restorations were in a range where clinical application seems not restricted, but insertion of a screw channel might reduce stability of individual materials.",2017,1,1,
376, Microstructure characterization and SCG of newly engineered dental ceramics,"C. Ramos Nde, T. M. Campos, I. S. Paz, J. P. Machado, M. A. Bottino, P. F. Cesar and R. M. Melo", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the microstructure of four dental CAD-CAM ceramics and evaluate their susceptibility to stress corrosion. METHODS: SEM and EDS were performed for microstructural characterization. For evaluation of the pattern of crystallization of the ceramics and the molecular composition, XRD and FTIR, respectively, were used. Elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, density and fracture toughness were also measured. The specimens were subjected to biaxial flexure under five stress rates (0.006, 0.06, 0.6, 6 and 60MPa/s) to determine the subcritical crack growth parameters (n and D). Twenty-five specimens were further tested in mineral oil for determination of Weibull parameters. Two hundred forty ceramic discs (12mm diameter and 1.2mm thick) were made from four ceramics: feldspathic ceramic - FEL (Vita Mark II, Vita Zahnfabrik), ceramic-infiltrated polymer - PIC (Vita Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik), lithium disilicate - LD (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) and zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate - LS (Vita Suprinity, Vita Zahnfabrik). RESULTS: PIC discs presented organic and inorganic phases (n=29.1±7.7) and Weibull modulus (m) of 8.96. The FEL discs showed n=36.6±6.8 and m=8.02. The LD discs showed a structure with needle-like disilicate grains in a glassy matrix and had the lowest value of n (8.4±0.8) and m=6.19. The ZLS discs showed similar rod-like grains, n=11.2±1.4 and m=9.98. SIGNIFICANCE: The FEL and PIC discs showed the lowest susceptibility to slow crack growth (SCG), whereas the LD and ZLS discs presented the highest. PIC presented the lowest elastic modulus and no crystals in its composition, while ZLS presented tetragonal zirconia. The overall strength and SCG of the new materials did not benefit from the additional phase or microconstituents present in them.",2016,1,0,
82, Colour stainability of indirect CAD-CAM processed composites vs. conventionally laboratory processed composites after immersion in staining solutions,"M. A. Arocha, J. Basilio, J. Llopis, E. Di Bella, M. Roig, S. Ardu and J. R. Mayoral", J Dent," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine, by using a spectrophotometer device, the colour stainability of two indirect CAD/CAM processed composites in comparison with two conventionally laboratory-processed composites after being immersed 4 weeks in staining solutions such as coffee, black tea and red wine, using distilled water as control group. METHODS: Two indirect CAD/CAM composites (Lava Ultimate and Paradigm MZ100) and two conventionally laboratory-processed composites (SR Adoro and Premise Indirect) of shade A2 were selected (160 disc samples). Colour stainability was measured after 4 weeks of immersion in three staining solutions (black tea, coffee, red wine) and distilled water. Specimen's colour was measured each week by means of a spectrophotometer (CIE L*a*b* system). Statistical analysis was carried out performing repeated ANOVA measurements and Tukey's HSD test to evaluate differences in ΔE00 measurements between groups; the interactions among composites, staining solutions and time duration were also evaluated. RESULTS: All materials showed significant discoloration (p<0.01) when compared to control group. The highest ΔE00 observed was with red wine, whereas black tea showed the lowest one. Indirect laboratory-processed resin composites showed the highest colour stability compared with CAD/CAM resin blocks. CONCLUSIONS: CAD/CAM processed composites immersed in staining solutions showed lower colour stability when compared to conventionally laboratory-processed resin composites. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The demand for CAD/CAM restorations has been increasing; however, colour stainability for such material has been insufficiently studied. Moreover, this has not been performed comparing CAD/CAM processed composites versus laboratory-processed indirect composites by immersing in staining solutions for long immersion periods.",2014,0,1,
444," Roughness, surface energy, and superficial damages of CAD/CAM materials after surface treatment","T. Strasser, V. Preis, M. Behr and M. Rosentritt", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of surface pre-treatment on CAD/CAM materials including ceramics, zirconia, resin-infiltrated ceramic, and resin-based composite. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens were made of ten CAD/CAM materials (Celtra Duo, Degudent, D; Vita Suprinity, Vita, D; E.max CAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent, FL; E.max ZirCAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent, FL; Vita Enamic, Vita, D; Cerasmart, GC, B; LAVA Ultimate, 3M, D; SHOFU Block HC, SHOFU, US; Grandio Blocs, VOCO, D; BRILLIANT Crios, Coltene, CH) and pretreated to represent clinical procedures (Hf 20 s/5%; phosphoric acid 20 s/37%; Monobond etch and prime (Ivoclar-Vivadent, FL); water-cooled diamond bur (80 μm; 4 μm); Al(2)O(3)-blasting (50 μm/1 bar, 50 μm/2 bar, 120 μm/1 bar, 120 μm/2 bar); untreated; manufacturer's instructions). SEM-analysis (Phenom, FEI, NL) of the surfaces was performed (magnifications ≤ 10,000×). Roughness values R(a), R(z) (KJ 3D, Keyence, J), and surface energy SE (OCA15 plus, SCA20, DataPhysics, D) were determined (statistics: non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test/Kruskal-Wallis test for independent specimen, α = 0.05). RESULTS: Kruskal-Wallis revealed significant (p < 0.001) differences for all materials with different surface treatments. Roughness ranged from R(a) = 0.05 μm (VS; D4)/R(z) = 0.41 μm (VS; D4) to R(a) = 1.82 μm (EMA; SB120/2)/R(z) = 12.05 μm (CS; SB 120/2), SE from 22.7 mN/m (VE; M) to 52.8 mN/m (CD; M). SEM analysis showed material-dependent damages after pre-treatment. CONCLUSION: Different CAD/CAM materials require individual pre-treatment for optimized and protective surface activation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cementation is a key factor for clinical success. Given the variety of available CAD/CAM materials, specific procedures are needed.",2018,1,1,
477," Surface Roughness of Ceramic-Resin Composites After Femtosecond Laser Irradiation, Sandblasting or Acid Etching and Their Bond Strength With and Without Silanization to a Resin Cement",Z. Demirtag and A. K. Culhaoglu, Oper Dent," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of femtosecond laser irradiation, sandblasting, or acid etching treatments on the surface roughness of ceramic-resin composites and also shear bond strength (SBS) with and without silanization to a resin cement. METHODS: Samples of Vita Enamic (VE; Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) and Lava Ultimate (LU; 3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) were classified into control (no treatment), sandblasting, hydrofluoric acid, and femtosecond laser groups (n=30). Surface roughness was determined using two-dimensional contact profilometry. Surface topography was evaluated using a three-dimensional contact profilometer and a scanning electron microscope. Then groups were divided into two subgroups with similar surface roughness values, including control (C), control + silane (C-S), sandblasting (SB), sandblasting + silane (SB-S), hydrofluoric acid (HF), hydrofluoric acid + silane (HF-S), femtosecond laser (FS), and femtosecond laser + silane (FS-S) groups (n=15). Panavia F 2.0 resin cement was applied to the sample surfaces using an SDI SBS rig (SDI Limited, Bayswater, Australia). The SBS test was performed after water storage (24 h, 37°C) and thermocycles (2000 cycles, 5°C to 55°C), and failure modes were evaluated. RESULTS: The highest surface roughness was observed in the FS group, and the highest SBS was observed in the FS-S group for both VE and LU ( p<0.001). Silanization improved the SBS of VE significantly ( p<0.001) in all surface treatments but did not improve that of LU except in the FS group ( p=0.004). There was a significantly moderate negative correlation in the VE/SB group ( p=0.012) and a moderate positive correlation in the VE/HF group ( p=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Femtosecond laser irradiation was found to be more effective than sandblasting or acid etching in increasing the surface roughness, and it was also the most effective surface treatment with silanization on the SBS of a resin cement to the ceramic-resin composites.",2019,1,1,
302, Influence of different universal adhesives on the repair performance of hybrid CAD-CAM materials,G. Demirel and H. Baltacıoğlu İ, Restor Dent Endod," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the microshear bond strength (μSBS) of different universal adhesive systems applied to hybrid computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorative materials repaired with a composite resin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four types of CAD-CAM hybrid block materials-Lava Ultimate (LA), Vita Enamic (VE), CeraSmart (CS), and Shofu Block HC (SH)-were used in this study, in combination with the following four adhesive protocols: 1) control: porcelain primer + total etch adhesive (CO), 2) Single Bond Universal (SB), 3) All Bond Universal (AB), and 4) Clearfil Universal Bond (CU). The μSBS of the composite resin (Clearfil Majesty Esthetic) was measured and the data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and the Tukey test, with the level of significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The CAD-CAM block type and block-adhesive combination had significant effects on the bond strength values (p < 0.05). Significant differences were found between the following pairs of groups: VE/CO and VE/AB, CS/CO and CS/AB, VE/CU and CS/CU, and VE/AB and CS/AB (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The μSBS values were affected by hybrid block type. All tested universal adhesive treatments can be used as an alternative to the control treatment for repair, except the AB system on VE blocks (the VE/AB group). The μSBS values showed variation across different adhesive treatments on different hybrid CAD-CAM block types.",2019,0,0,
237, Fracture load of three-unit full-contour fixed dental prostheses fabricated with subtractive and additive CAD/CAM technology,"M. Zimmermann, A. Ender, T. Attin and A. Mehl", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the fracture load of ceramic and composite three-unit full-contour fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) fabricated with additive and subtractive computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A newly developed alveolar socket replica model for a three-unit FDP replacing one molar was used in this study. Five CAD/CAM materials were used for fabrication of three-unit FDPs (each n = 12). The subtractive CAD/CAM fabrication method was used for groups BC (BRILLIANT Crios), TC (Telio CAD), EX (e.max CAD), and TZ (inCoris TZI C), and the additive method was used for group 3D (els 3D resin even stronger). FDPs were adhesively seated to the abutment dies (PANAVIA V5 system). Thermomechanical loading was performed prior to fracture testing with a universal testing machine. The data for maximum fracture load values was analyzed with one-way ANOVA and post hoc Scheffé test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: All FDPs survived the thermomechanical loading test. Statistically significant differences were found for the fracture load of three-unit FDPs fabricated from different CAD/CAM materials (p < 0.05). The highest mean fracture load was found for group TZ (2099.5 ± 382.1 N). Group 3D showed the lowest mean fracture load (928.9 ± 193.8 N). Group BC performed statistically significantly differently from group 3D with a mean fracture load of 1494.8 ± 214.5 N (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Particle-filled composite resin CAD/CAM materials showed fracture load values within the range of ceramic materials with a specific indication of use for three-unit FDPs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Particle filled composite CAD/CAM materials may offer new treatment possibilities for the CAD/CAM workflow.",2020,0,1,
435, Resin composite blocks via high-pressure high-temperature polymerization,"J. F. Nguyen, V. Migonney, N. D. Ruse and M. Sadoun", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to thermo-polymerize under high pressure four commercially available dental resin composites to obtain and characterize composite blocks suitable for CAD/CAM procedures. METHODS: Gradia (GC, Japan), Vita VM LC (Vita Zahnfabrik, Germany), Grandio (VOCO, Germany), and EsthetX (Dentsply, Germany), were selected for this study. Paradigm (3 M ESPE, USA), a CAD/CAM composite block, was included for comparison. Composite blocks were obtained through polymerization at high-temperature high-pressure (HT/HP). Samples for mechanical/physical characterizations were cut from Paradigm and HT/HP composite blocks while control samples were obtained by photo-polymerizing (PP) the materials in molds. Flexural strength (σ(f)), fracture toughness (K(IC)), hardness, and density (ρ) were determined and compared by pairwise t-tests (α=0.05). Fractured surfaces were characterized under a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: The results have shown that HT/HP polymerization resulted in a significant (p<0.05) increase in σ(f), hardness, and ρ for all composites investigated. Even if K(IC) of all materials was increased by HT/HP polymerization, significant increases were detected only for Gradia and EsthetX. The Weibull modulus of HT/HP polymerized composites was higher than that of PP counterparts. HT/HP materials had higher σ(f), Weibull modulus, and K(IC) compared to Paradigm. The most significant SEM observation of fractured K(IC) specimens from all the materials tested was the presence of fewer and smaller voids in HT/HP polymerized composites. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study suggest that HT/HP polymerization could be used to obtain dental resin composite blocks with superior mechanical properties, suitable for CAD/CAM processing.",2012,0,1,
418, Properties of experimental urethane dimethacrylate-based dental resin composite blocks obtained via thermo-polymerization under high pressure,"J. F. Nguyen, V. Migonney, N. D. Ruse and M. Sadoun", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to use high-pressure high-temperature (HP/HT) polymerization to produce urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA)-triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) based resin composite blocks (RCB) suitable for dental computer-aided design/manufacture (CAD/CAM) applications and to compare their physical/mechanical properties to those of a commercial dental RCB. The null hypotheses tested were: (1) there are no differences in the physical/mechanical properties between HP/HT polymerized UDMA-TEGDMA RCB and a commercial RCB; (2) volume fraction filler (Vf) does not affect the physical/mechanical properties of HP/HT polymerized RCB. METHODS: Four UDMA-based experimental RCB were manufactured under HP/HT conditions. A RCB manufactured under the same HP/HT conditions from a commercial resin composite (Z100) and its commercial counterpart CAD/CAM RCB (Paradigm MZ100) were used as controls. Flexural strength (σf), fracture toughness (KIC), and hardness were determined. The results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Scheffé multiple means comparisons (α=0.05), and Weibull statistics (for σf). Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize fractured surfaces. RESULTS: All HP/HT polymerized RCB had superior σf, KIC, and Weibull modulus compared to the commercial dental RCB. The experimental RCB had similar or superior properties compared to HP/HT polymerized Z100 RCB. Fewer and smaller porosities (not quantified) were apparent in HP/HT polymerized RCB. The experimental RCB that contained 65% Vf showed higher porosity, suggesting practical difficulties in filler incorporation beyond a certain Vf. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that RCB suitable for dental CAD/CAM applications could be obtained by HP/HT polymerization of resin composites based on pure UDMA.",2013,0,1,
518, Toxicology of Pre-heated Composites Polymerized Directly and Through CAD/CAM Overlay,"A. Knezevic, D. Zeljezic, N. Kopjar, S. Duarte, Jr., M. Par and Z. Tarle", Acta Stomatol Croat," OBJECTIVES: The aim was to compare cytotoxicity/genotoxicity of pre-heated composites polymerized through CAD/CAM overlays on isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A microhybrid (Z100, 3M ESPE) and nanofilled composite (Filtek Supreme Ultra, 3M ESPE) were heated in a heating unit (Calset, AdDent Inc.) at different temperatures: 37 (o)C, 54 (o)C, and 68 (o)C. A small amount of heated composite was placed in a cylindrical mold (6mm diameter; 0.65mm thick), covered with a Mylar sheet, pressed and light-cured directly and through 2 mm thick CAD/CAM ceramic-reinforced polymer (CRP)(LAVA Ultimate, 3M ESPE) or CAD/CAM lithium disilicate ceramic (LDC)(e.max, Ivoclar/Vivadent) overlay. After curing, the specimens were immediately placed in a prepared lymphocyte cell culture. Cytotoxicity was assessed using a dye exclusion method by simultaneous staining with ethidium bromide and acridine orange, aimed to determine percentages of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells. Genotoxicity was studied using alkaline comet assay. RESULTS: For Z100, the highest percentage of viable cells is recorded at T1 (93.7%) after direct light curing, followed by light curing through CRP (92.3%) and through LDC (91.7%T1,T3). For Filtek Supreme Ultra, the highest percentage of viable cells is recorded while curing through CRP (91.0% T2), followed by LDC (90% T1,T3) and direct light curing (88.7%T2). CONCLUSION: For both tested materials, preheating the procedure at T1 and T2 may be the procedure of choice. In terms of genotoxicity, preheating at T3 may not be suggested.",2018,1,0,
318, Influence of short-fiber composite base on fracture behavior of direct and indirect restorations,"S. Garoushi, S. Sungur, Y. Boz, P. Ozkan, P. K. Vallittu, S. Uctasli and L. Lassila", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: The aim was to examine the influence of short-fiber composite (SFC) core on the fracture-behavior of different types of indirect posterior restorations. In addition, the effect of thickness ratio of SFC-core to the thickness of the veneering conventional composite (PFC) on fracture-behavior of bi-structured composite restorations was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MOD cavities with removed palatal cusps were prepared on 90 intact molars. Five groups of direct overlay restorations (n = 10/group) were fabricated having a SFC-core (everX Flow) with various thicknesses (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 mm) and layer of surface PFC (G-aenial Anterior), remaining the thickness of the bi-structure restoration to be 5 mm. Four groups of CAD/CAM-made restorations (Cerasmart 270 and e-max CAD) were fabricated either with 2-mm layer of SFC-core or without fiber reinforcement. Intact teeth (n = 10) were used as control group. Restorations were statically loaded until fracture. Fracture patterns were evaluated visually. Data were analyzed using ANOVA (p = 0.05). RESULTS: With indirect overlay restorations, no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in the load-bearing capacities between restorations reinforced by 2-mm SFC-core (bi-structured) and those fabricated from plain restorative materials. ANOVA displayed that direct overlay restorations made from 4-mm layer thickness of SFC-core had significantly higher load-bearing capacities (3050 ± 574 N) (p < 0.05) among all the groups tested. CONCLUSIONS: Restorations (direct/indirect) combining SFC-core and a surface layer of conventional material demonstrated encouraging achievement in reference to fracture behavior. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of flowable short-fiber composite as reinforcing base with large direct and indirect restorations may result in more repairable failure.",2021,0,0,
264, How well can today's tooth-colored dental restorative materials reproduce the autofluorescence of human teeth? - Ambition and reality!,"C. Klein, T. Connert, C. von Ohle and C. Meller", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVES: The autofluorescence of dental hard tissues has been known for over 100 years. Thus, manufacturers add fluorophores to dental restorative materials to improve the esthetic properties of these materials. So far, there has been no study evaluating the ability of these fluorophores to reproduce the autofluorescence of dental hard tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 240 different color shades representing 17 different brands of fluorescent light-curing RBC and CAD/CAM restorative materials were analyzed with a monochromator-based microplate reader. Additionally, combined enamel-dentin specimens (n = 11) were analyzed as ""gold standard"". The total fluorescence (TF) and the physiologically relevant luminous efficiency function adjusted total fluorescence (TF(a) ) were determined. The differences between the brands and the enamel-dentin specimens were further evaluated and visualized as contour plots. RESULTS: Merely the TF(a) of the brands CERASMART™, Filtek Supreme XTE™, KZR-CAD HD 2, and LuxaCam composite were not significantly different to the enamel-dentin specimens. The analysis of the contour plots revealed that even these four materials showed a fluorescence excess for the excitation wavelengths below about 400 nm and a deficit above this wavelength. CONCLUSION: None of the materials analyzed in this study were able to reproduce the natural fluorescence spectrum of the enamel-dentin specimens. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Unlike the statements and images of blue fluorescent materials in the manufacturers' brochures, none of the materials examined here is fully capable of reproducing the natural autofluorescence of teeth.",2021,0,0,
45, Bonding effectiveness of adhesive luting agents to enamel and dentin,"K. Hikita, B. Van Meerbeek, J. De Munck, T. Ikeda, K. Van Landuyt, T. Maida, P. Lambrechts and M. Peumans", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: The bonding effectiveness of five adhesive luting agents to enamel and dentin using different application procedures was determined using a micro-tensile bond strength protocol (microTBS). METHODS: Enamel/dentin surfaces of human third molars were flattened using a high-speed diamond bur. Composite resin blocks (Paradigm, 3M ESPE) were luted using either Linkmax (LM; GC), Nexus 2 (NX; Kerr), Panavia F (PN; Kuraray), RelyX Unicem (UN; 3M ESPE) or Variolink II (VL; Ivoclar-Vivadent), strictly following manufacturers' instructions. For some luting agents, modified application procedures were also tested, resulting in four other experimental groups: Prompt L-Pop+RelyX Unicem (PLP+UN; 3M ESPE), Scotchbond Etchant+RelyX Unicem (SE+UN; 3M ESPE), Optibond Solo Plus Activator+Nexus 2 (ACT+NX; Kerr) and K-Etchant gel+Panavia-F (KE+P; Kuraray). The experimental groups were classified according to the adhesive approach in self-adhesive (UN), etch-and-rinse (ACT+NX, NX, KE+P, SE+UN and VL when bonded to enamel) and self-etch adhesive luting agents (LM, PLP+UN, PN and VL when bonded to dentin). The specimens were stored for 24h in distilled water at 37 degrees C prior to microTBS testing. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine pairwise statistical differences (p<0.05) in microTBS between the experimental groups. RESULTS: When bonded to enamel, ACT+NX (15 MPa) and UN (19.6 MPa) scored significantly lower than VL (49.3 MPa), LM (49.2 MPa), PN (35.4 MPa) and SE+UN (35.2 MPa), while PLP+UN (23.5 MPa) showed a significantly lower microTBS than VL (49.3 MPa) and LM (49.2 MPa). No significant differences were noticed between VL (49.3 MPa), LM (49.2 MPa), NX (37.9 MPa), KE+PN (38.8 MPa), PN (35.4 MPa) and SE+UN (35.2 MPa). Regarding the bonding effectiveness to dentin, all luting agents bonded equally effectively (UN: 15.9 MPa; LM: 15.4 MPa; PN: 17.5 MPa; NX: 22.3 MPa), except VL (1.1 MPa), SE+UN (5.9 MPa) and ACT+NX (13.2 MPa). VL revealed an exceptionally high number of pre-testing failures, most likely due to a combined effect of not having cured the adhesive separately and an insufficiently light-cured luting agent. SIGNIFICANCE: Following a correct application procedure, the etch-and-rinse, self-etch and self-adhesive luting agents are equally effective in bonding to enamel and dentin. Several factors negatively influenced bond strength such as bonding RelyX Unicem to enamel without prior phosphoric acid etching; no separate light-curing of a light-polymerizable adhesive prior to cementation, use of a light-polymerizing adhesive converted into a dual-polymerizing adhesive, and use of a dual-cure luting agent with a low auto-polymerizable potential.",2007,0,1,
183, Effects of High-Temperature-Pressure Polymerized Resin-Infiltrated Ceramic Networks on Oral Stem Cells,"M. Tassin, E. Bonte, L. S. Loison-Robert, A. Nassif, T. Berbar, S. Le Goff, A. Berdal, M. Sadoun and B. P. Fournier", PLoS One," OBJECTIVES: The development of CAD-CAM techniques called for new materials suited to this technique and offering a safe and sustainable clinical implementation. The infiltration of resin in a ceramic network under high pressure and high temperature defines a new class of hybrid materials, namely polymer infiltrated ceramics network (PICN), for this purpose which requires to be evaluated biologically. We used oral stem cells (gingival and pulpal) as an in vitro experimental model. METHODS: Four biomaterials were grinded, immersed in a culture medium and deposed on stem cells from dental pulp (DPSC) and gingiva (GSC): Enamic (VITA®), Experimental Hybrid Material (EHM), EHM with initiator (EHMi) and polymerized Z100™ composite material (3M®). After 7 days of incubation; viability, apoptosis, proliferation, cytoskeleton, inflammatory response and morphology were evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: Proliferation was insignificantly delayed by all the tested materials. Significant cytotoxicity was observed in presence of resin based composites (MTT assay), however no detectable apoptosis and some dead cells were detected like in PICN materials. Cell morphology, major cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix components were not altered. An intimate contact appeared between the materials and cells. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The three new tested biomaterials did not exhibit adverse effects on oral stem cells in our experimental conditions and may be an interesting alternative to ceramics or composite based CAD-CAM blocks.",2016,1,0,
152, Effect of Pretreatment and Activation Mode on the Interfacial Adaptation of Nanoceramic Resin Inlay and Self-adhesive Resin Cement,"S. H. Han, Y. Shimada, A. Sadr, J. Tagami, K. Y. Kum and S. H. Park", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: The first objective of this study was to determine if the luting material used for resin nanoceramic inlay affects interfacial adaptation. The second was to investigate whether pretreatment and the adhesive curing method before cementation affects interfacial adaptation. The final objective was to compare activation modes of luting material. METHODS: Class I cavities were prepared on extracted human third molars. Resin nanoceramic inlays were fabricated using Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM block (3 M). For the control groups, inlays were cemented using Panavia V5 (Kuraray Noritake). For the experimental groups, teeth were randomly divided into five experimental groups with four subgroups using different self-adhesive cements (SACs). Cement in Group I was dual-cured without pretreatment. In Group II, the cement was dual-cured after polyacrylic acid treatment of the tooth cavity. In Groups III and IV, the cement was dual-cured after universal dentin adhesive treatment with pre-cure and co-cure methods. In Group V, the inlay was cemented in self-cure mode. After thermocycling, interfacial adaptation at the inlay-tooth interface was measured using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging. Finally, polymerization shrinkage strain of the luting material was measured and compared. RESULTS: Interfacial adaptation differed depending on the luting material. After application of a universal adhesive, some subgroups showed improved interfacial adaptation. Interfacial adaptation and polymerization shrinkage strain differed significantly depending on activation mode. SIGNIFICANCE: Interfacial adaptation for a resin nanoceramic inlay can differ according to the type of SAC and activation mode. For some SACs, application of a universal adhesive before cementation improves interfacial adaptation.",2020,1,0,
53, Brittleness index of machinable dental materials and its relation to the marginal chipping factor,"E. A. Tsitrou, S. E. Northeast and R. van Noort", J Dent," OBJECTIVES: The machinability of a material can be measured with the calculation of its brittleness index (BI). It is possible that different materials with different BI could produce restorations with varied marginal integrity. The degree of marginal chipping of a milled restoration can be estimated by the calculation of the marginal chipping factor (CF). The aim of this study is to investigate any possible correlation between the BI of machinable dental materials and the CF of the final restorations. METHODS: The CEREC system was used to mill a wide range of materials used with that system; namely the Paradigm MZ100 (3M/ESPE), Vita Mark II (VITA), ProCAD (Ivoclar-Vivadent) and IPS e.max CAD (Ivoclar-Vivadent). A Vickers Hardness Tester was used for the calculation of BI, while for the calculation of CF the percentage of marginal chipping of crowns prepared with bevelled marginal angulations was estimated. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that Paradigm MZ100 had the lowest BI and CF, while IPS e.max CAD demonstrated the highest BI and CF. Vita Mark II and ProCAD had similar BI and CF and were lying between the above materials. Statistical analysis of the results showed that there is a perfect positive correlation between BI and CF for all the materials. CONCLUSIONS: The BI and CF could be both regarded as indicators of a material's machinability. Within the limitations of this study it was shown that as the BI increases so does the potential for marginal chipping, indicating that the BI of a material can be used as a predictor of the CF.",2007,0,0,
523, Ultra-thin occlusal veneers bonded to enamel and made of ceramic or hybrid materials exhibit load-bearing capacities not different from conventional restorations,"A. Ioannidis, S. Mühlemann, M. Özcan, J. Hüsler, C. H. F. Hämmerle and G. I. Benic", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to test whether or not the load-bearing capacity of occlusal veneers bonded to enamel and made of ceramic or hybrid materials does differ from those of porcelain-fused-to-metal or lithium disilicate glass ceramic crowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 80 human molars occlusal enamel was removed without extending into the dentin in order to mimic substance defects caused by attrition. The restorations were digitally designed at a standardized thickness of either 0.5 mm or 1.0 mm. For each thickness, 4 test groups were formed each including a different restorative material: ""0.5-ZIR"": 0.5 mm thick zirconia (Vita YZ HT); ""1.0-ZIR"": 1.0 mm thick zirconia (Vita YZ HT); ""0.5-LDC"": 0.5 mm thick lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press); ""1.0-LDC"": 1.0 mm thick lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press); ""0.5-HYC"": 0.5 mm thick PICN (Vita Enamic); ""1.0-HYC"": 1.0 mm thick PICN (Vita Enamic); ""0.5-COC"": 0.5 mm thick tooth shaded resin composite (Lava Ultimate) and ""1.0-COC"": 1.0 mm thick tooth shaded resin composite (Lava ultimate). Each group consists of 10 specimens. Two additional groups of 10 specimens each were used as controls and exhibited conventional crown preparations. In one group the crowns were made of lithium-disilicate ceramic (""CLD"": IPS e.max CAD) and the other group consisted of porcelain-fused to metal crowns (""PFM""). All restorations were cemented onto the prepared teeth following the manufacturer's instruction of the corresponding luting cement. Subsequently, they were thermo-mechanically aged and then loaded until fracture. Load-bearing capacities (F(max)) between the groups were compared applying the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) and pairwise group comparisons using the Dunn's method. RESULTS: Median values (and quartiles) for the load-bearing capacity amounted to (F(max)) 2'407 (1'670; 2'490) N for the CLD group and to 2'033 (1'869; 2'445) N for the PFM group. For the 0.5 mm thick restorations F(max) reached the highest median value in group 0.5-HYC 2'390 (1'355; 2'490) N, followed by 0.5-COC 2'200 (1'217; 2'492) N and 0.5-LDC 1'692 (1'324; 2'355) N. No results were obtained for group 0.5-ZIR due to the impracticability to fabricate ultra-thin specimens. The distribution of the values for the 1.0 mm thick restorations was 2'489 (2'426; 2'491) N for 1.0-COC, 2'299 (2'156; 2'490) N for 1.0-ZIR, 2'124 (1'245; 2'491) N for 1.0-HYC, and 1'537 (1'245; 1'783) N for 1.0-LDC. The differences of the medians between the test and the control groups did not reach statistical significance for the 0.5 mm thick specimens (KW: p = 0.6952 and p = 0.6986). Within the groups exhibiting 1.0 mm thickness, however, significant different medians were found: 1.0-LDC < 1.0-ZIR and 1.0-LDC < 1.0-COC (KW: p < 0.0209). CONCLUSIONS: Regarding their maximum load-bearing capacity, minimally invasive occlusal veneers made of ceramic and hybrid materials can be applied to correct occlusal tooth wear and thus replace conventional crown restorations.",2019,1,1,
307," Influence of material type, thickness and storage on fracture resistance of CAD/CAM occlusal veneers","E. Albelasy, H. H. Hamama, J. K. H. Tsoi and S. H. Mahmoud", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of restoration thickness, CAD/CAM material, and 6 months of artificial saliva storage on the fracture resistance of occlusal veneers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 intact maxillary molars were sectioned 4.0 mm occlusal to the cementoenamel junction to expose the dentine. The teeth were assigned into 3 main groups according to the type of restorative material (e.max CAD, Vita Enamic, and Lava Ultimate). In each group, the teeth were allocated into 2 subgroups (n = 14) according to restoration thickness (1.0 and 1.5 mm). The veneers were adhesively bonded using dual-cure self-adhesive luting agent. A total of 42 specimens comprising half the tested subgroups were stored in distilled water for 24-h before the test. The remaining half was stored in artificial saliva at 37 ± 1 °C in an incubator for 6 months. All specimens (n = 84) were subjected to 5000 thermal cycles between 5 and 55 °C ± 2 before the fracture resistance test. The maximum force at fracture was recorded in Newton. Failure mode was analyzed using a stereomicroscope. The results were analyzed using a parametric Three-way ANOVA test. RESULTS: The results of the Three-way ANOVA test revealed that material type and restoration thickness significantly affected fracture resistance values (p < 0.5), while 6 months of storage in artificial saliva had no significant effect on mean fracture resistance values (p˃0.5). The most common failure patterns in CAD/CAM resin composite and polymer-infiltrated ceramics were scores I and score II. For glass ceramic groups, score IV and III were more dominant. CONCLUSIONS: All the tested CAD/CAM restorations in both thicknesses exhibited fracture resistance values exceeding normal and parafunctional bite forces. Polymer-infiltrated ceramics and CAD/CAM resin composite veneers showed more favorable fracture patterns.",2021,1,1,
421, Reliability of wear measurements of CAD-CAM restorative materials after artificial aging in a mastication simulator,"A. Grau, B. Stawarczyk, M. Roos, B. Theelke and R. Hampe", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess the 2-body wear behavior of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorative materials and additionally to validate an automatic approach to wear quantification as provided by newly developed software. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two composite resins (Experimental Composite, Shofu Block HC), 1 polymethyl methacrylate- (PMMA)-based material (Telio CAD), and 1 dual-network material (VITA Enamic) were tested (n = 12). The materials were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 14 days, then aged in a mastication simulator (cycles: 400 000, 50 N, 1.2 Hz, 5/55 °C) for 2-body wear testing with human molars as antagonists. Software was developed as a freely available function in R for automatic wear quantification and was applied to 2 (vertical and horizontal) images obtained by an optical laser scanner (SDM). Wear measurements were validated with a reference confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM) system. The Kruskal-Wallis with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test (α = 0.05), coefficient of variation, Bland-Altman method, and intraclass correlation were applied. RESULTS: Shofu Block HC showed the greatest wear, and no differences were found among other materials. The automatic wear measurements agreed well with the reference LSM system. The reliability of the SDM scans was 98.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The wear resistance caused by two-body wear differed among the restorative materials tested, with the mean wear resistance of the 2 composite resin materials differing significantly. Wear quantification with R software based on SDM scans showed satisfactory agreement with the reference LSM system.",2018,0,1,
139, Effect of endodontic access simulation on the fracture strength of lithium-disilicate and resin-matrix ceramic CAD-CAM crowns,"E. Oguz, M. A. Kılıçarslan and M. Özcan", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of simulated endodontic access preparation on the failure loads of lithium disilicate crowns and resin-matrix ceramic (RMC) crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty maxillary first premolar crowns were manufactured by using four different CAD/CAM blocks (n = 20): lithium disilicate (LD; IPS e.max CAD), resin nanoceramic (RNC; Lava Ultimate), flexible nanaoceramic (FNC; GC Cerasmart), and polymer-infiltrated ceramic (PIC; VITA Enamic). Half of each group was accessed and repaired to simulate endodontic treatment. After cyclic loading, all specimens were loaded to failure. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-HSD test (α = .05). RESULTS: The load to failure results showed significant differences for material types (P < .001), but not for endodontic access simulation (P = .09). The highest and lowest mean failure loads were obtained for LD (1546 N) and PIC (843 N), respectively. CONCLUSION: The endodontic access preparation was not found to affect the fracture strength of LD and RMC crowns. The LD showed higher fracture strength than RMC crowns. Even though significant differences were noted for failure loads regarding different crown materials, all could reasonably withstand masticatory forces. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The endodontic access preparation through a restoration is known to be a common challenge in clinical practice. Maintaining a repaired LD or RMC crown is feasible and replacement may not be necessary.",2020,1,0,
244, Fracture resistance of ceramic and polymer-based occlusal veneer restorations,"M. Al-Akhali, M. S. Chaar, A. Elsayed, A. Samran and M. Kern", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of thermodynamic loading on the durability and fracture resistance behavior of occlusal veneers fabricated from different biomedical dental CAD/CAM materials. METHODS: The occlusal surfaces of 64 extracted premolars were prepared in the enamel layer and restored with occlusal veneers with a fissure/cusp thickness of 0.5/0.8mm made from four different dental CAD/CAM materials: group LD lithium disilicate (e.max CAD), group LS zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (Vita Suprinity), group PI polymer-infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic), and group PM polymethylmethacrylate PMMA (Telio CAD). The prepared teeth were etched with phosphoric acid. The occlusal veneers were then bonded using an adhesive luting system (Multilink Primer A/B and Multilink Automix luting resin). Half of the specimens were subjected to thermodynamic loading in a chewing simulator (1.2 million cycles at 98N). All specimens were quasi-statically loaded until fracture. The statistical analysis was made using the t-test and one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey HSD test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: All aged specimens survived the thermodynamic loading. Thermodynamic loading significantly raised the fracture resistance in groups LS, PI, and PM (P < 0.03). Occlusal veneers made from lithium disilicate and zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate recorded higher fracture resistance than those made from polymer-infiltrated ceramic and PMMA resin. CONCLUSIONS: All tested dental CAD/CAM biomaterials exhibited a fracture resistance considerably exceeding the average occlusal force in the posterior dentition. Therefore, they might present a viable long-term treatment for restoring the occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth.",2017,1,0,
350, Marginal and internal fit of nano-composite CAD/CAM restorations,"S. H. Park, Y. J. Yoo, Y. J. Shin, B. H. Cho and S. H. Baek", Restor Dent Endod," OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the marginal and internal fit of nano-composite CAD-CAM restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full veneer crown and an mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) inlay cavity, which were prepared on extracted human molars, were used as templates of epoxy resin replicas. The prepared teeth were scanned and CAD-CAM restorations were milled using Lava Ultimate (LU) and experimental nano-composite CAD/CAM blocks (EB) under the same milling parameters. To assess the marginal and internal fit, the restorations were cemented to replicas and were embedded in an acrylic mold for sectioning at 0.5 mm intervals. The measured gap data were pooled according to the block types and measuring points for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Both the block type and measuring point significantly affected gap values, and their interaction was significant (p = 0.000). In crowns and inlays made from the two blocks, gap values were significantly larger in the occlusal area than in the axial area, while gap values in the marginal area were smallest (p < 0.001). Among the blocks, the restorations milled from EB had a significantly larger gap at all measuring points than those milled from LU (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The marginal and internal gaps of the two nano-composite CAD/CAM blocks differed according to the measuring points. Among the internal area of the two nano-composite CAD/CAM restorations, occlusal gap data were significantly larger than axial gap data. The EB crowns and inlays had significantly larger gaps than LU restorations.",2016,0,1,
325, Influence of two different cement space settings and three different cement types on the fit of polymer-infiltrated ceramic network material crowns manufactured using a complete digital workflow,"R. Dauti, B. Lilaj, P. Heimel, A. Moritz, A. Schedle and B. Cvikl", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: The study evaluates the influence of two spacer settings and three resin luting materials on the marginal and internal fit of polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material crowns manufactured using a complete digital workflow. METHODS: Optical impressions of fifty identical dies were performed using the 3M scanner (software version 5.0.2). Twenty crowns were designed using Ceramill Mind (version 3.4.10.1163), from which ten with spacer setting of 50 μm (G1) and ten with 80 μm (G2). Thirty crowns (spacer setting of 50 μm) were divided into three groups corresponding to the resin materials used as follows: RelyX Unicem (RX), Variolink Esthetic (VLE), and Nexus 3 (NX3). All crowns were milled from Vita Enamic blocks. After micro-CT scanning, absolute marginal discrepancy (AMD), internal gap (IG), total cement space volume (TCV), and marginal porosities (VP) were measured. RESULTS: Significant difference was detected on the VP between the RX and NX3 group (p = 0.033). The mean values of all parameters were the following: AMD (μm): G1 182.6, G2 253.7, RX 210.8, VLE 195.5, NX3 186.6; IG (μm): G1 215.6, G2 173.1, RX 171.1, VLE 198.6, NX3 203; TCV (mm(3)): G1 22.9, G2 20.49, RX 17.57, VLE 17.49, NX3 20.59; VP (mm(3)): G1 0.26, G2 0.34, RX 0.32, VLE 0.46, NX3 0.54. CONCLUSIONS: Fit of PICN material crowns was not significantly influenced by increasing the spacer settings and cementation with different resin materials. Additionally, RelyX Unicem showed significantly less porosities as compared with Nexus3. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Both 50 μm and 80 μm virtual spacer settings can be suggested for the manufacture of PICN crowns when Ceramill Mind (version 3.4.10.1163) is used. Furthermore, a self-adhesive system can be recommended for the cementation.",2020,1,0,
482, Teaching dental undergraduate students restorative CAD/CAM technology: evaluation of a new concept,"M. Zimmermann, W. Mörmann, A. Mehl and R. Hickel", Int J Comput Dent," OBJECTIVES: The use of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology in restorative dentistry has increased significantly and should consequently be taught more intensively at university dental schools. This study describes the evaluation of a new CAD/CAM teaching concept. METHODS: CAD/CAM technology was implemented into a 4th-year clinical student course according to Miller's pyramid principle. Fifty-eight students with no clinical experience participated in a 2-day theoretical and practical introductory course and rated its didactic outcome (Questionnaire 1). Students selected the fabrication method for indirect single tooth restorations during a 5-month patient treatment course. 54 conventional (e.max Press) and 68 CAD/CAM (Lava Ultimate) indirect Cerec-method restorations were fabricated and seated adhesively (Syntac, Variolink II). The success of the CAD/CAM integration was analyzed by the students, who were grouped according to their selected fabrication method (Questionnaire 2), as follows: Group A (CAD/CAM, n = 18); Group B (conventional and CAD/CAM, n = 17); Group C (conventional, n = 23). RESULTS: The questionnaire ratings were expressed as a percentage of the number of students' answers and are presented as diagrams. 95% of all the students in all the groups wanted CAD/CAM technology to be integrated into the subsequent (5th-year) clinical course. The rating for the CAD/CAM introductory course on a scale of 1 (very good) to 6 (poor) was 1.86 on average for the theoretical part, and 2.20 for the practical part. Statistically significant differences were found among the technology groupings (Pearson's chi-squared test, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CAD/CAM technology was highly welcomed by the 4th-year students and was introduced successfully into the clinical student course. Students tended to favor technology in accordance with the extent of its clinical application.",2019,0,0,
199, Evaluation of Marginal and Internal Adaptation of Endocrowns Fabricated from Three Different CAD/CAM Materials,"M. Hasanzade, M. Moharrami and M. Alikhasi", Eur J Prosthodont Restor Dent," OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study aimed to compare the internal and marginal discrepancies of endocrowns fabricated from different ceramics before and after adjustment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-six endocrowns were fabricated from lithium disilicate (IPS e-max CAD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (Suprinity), and polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (Enamic) using a CEREC intraoral scanner and milling unit. A reference point matching scan protocol was used to measure the endocrowns fit. The mixed ANOVA was used to analyze the data, and α=0.5 was considered as the significance level. RESULTS: There was no significant interaction between the fabrication materials and adjustment (P⟩0.05). Type of the materials did not change discrepancies at cavosurface, line angle, cavity wall, and pulpal floor (P⟩0.05). On the contrary, adjustment significantly decreased the discrepancies at all four sites (P⟨0.001). There were significant differences between every two sites before adjustment (P⟨0.001). After adjustment, except for cavosurface and cavity wall (P=0.058), the differences between other sites remained significant (P⟨0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IPS e-max CAD, Suprinity, and Enamic endocrowns were not significantly different regarding internal and marginal discrepancies. However, it is suggested that these materials be adjusted to fall in a clinically acceptable range to minimize the risk of caries and periodontal disease.",2019,1,0,
314, Influence of proximal box elevation technique on marginal integrity of adhesively luted Cerec inlays,"V. Müller, K. H. Friedl, K. Friedl, S. Hahnel, G. Handel and R. Lang", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study evaluated the marginal quality of Lava Ultimate inlays in deep proximal cavities with and without proximal box elevation (PBE) before and after thermomechanical loading (TML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mesio-occluso-distal cavities with proximal boxes beneath the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) were prepared in 24 human molars. Then, one of the proximal boxes was elevated with Filtek Supreme above the CEJ. The specimens were divided into three groups (n = 8). The inlays of group A were adhesively luted to the cavities with Scotchbond Universal and Rely X Ultimate, the inlays of group B with Monobond Plus, Syntac, and Variolink II, and the inlays of group C with Clearfil Ceramic Primer and Panavia SA Cement. Epoxy resin replicas were taken before and after thermomechanical loading (1,200,000 cycles, 55 °C/5 °C, max. load 50 N). Marginal integrity at the different interfaces tooth/PBE, tooth/dentine, inlay/PBE, inlay/dentine was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (×200). The percentage of continuous margin (% of total proximal margin length) was compared between the groups before and after TML. STATISTICS: Mann-Whitney U test (p = 0.05). RESULTS: No significant differences (p > 0.05) before and after TML were found between the three groups for bonding the inlay to dentine or to PBE composite. CONCLUSIONS: The marginal integrities of bonding inlays directly to dentine are not different from bonding inlays to a proximal box, which has been elevated by a composite filling material. For deep proximal cavities, the PBE technique could be an alternative technique to conventional methods. Clinical research is needed to confirm.",2017,0,0,
72, Clinical evaluation of chairside Computer Assisted Design/Computer Assisted Machining nano-ceramic restorations: Five-year status,"D. J. Fasbinder, G. F. Neiva, D. Heys and R. Heys", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVES: This investigation was a longitudinal, randomized clinical trial to measure the clinical performance of a nano-ceramic material (Lava Ultimate/3M) for chairside Computer Assisted Design/Computer Assisted Machining (CAD/CAM) fabricated restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty chairside CAD/CAM onlays were restored with a CEREC system randomly assigned to 60 leucite-reinforced ceramic (IPS EmpressCAD/Ivoclar Vivadent AGBendererstrasse 2FL-9494 SchaanLiechtenstein) onlays and 60 nano-ceramic (Lava Ultimate/3M) onlays. Equal groups of onlays were cemented using a self-etch and a total etch adhesive resin cement. The onlays were recalled for a period of 5 years. RESULTS: At 1 week postoperatively, 10% of the onlays cemented with both the self-etch and total etch adhesive resin cements were reported as slightly sensitive. However, all patients were asymptomatic by the 4th week without treatment. Four leucite-reinforced onlays and one nano-ceramic onlay fractured and required replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Adhesive retention with a self-etch or total etch cementation technique resulted in a similar clinical outcome with no reported debonds. The nano-ceramic onlays had a lower incidence of fracture compared to the leucite-reinforced ceramic onlays with both having a very low risk of fracture. Nano-ceramic onlays performed equally as well as glass ceramic onlays over 5 years of clinical service. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Ceramic materials have been a mainstay for chairside CAD/CAM restorations for the past 30 years and a new category of resilient ceramics with a resin matrix has been introduced reported to offer ceramic-like durability and esthetics with resin-like efficiency in handling. There are no long-term clinical studies on the performance of these materials. This is a 5-year randomized clinical trial on the performance of nano-ceramic onlays.",2020,1,0,
184," Effects of hydrothermal aging, thermal cycling, and water storage on the mechanical properties of a machinable resin-based composite containing nano-zirconia fillers","Y. Yan, C. Chen, B. Chen, J. Shen, H. Zhang and H. Xie", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of hydrothermal aging, thermal cycling, and water storage on the mechanical properties of a machinable resin-based composite containing nano-zirconia fillers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A machinable resin-based composite containing nano-zirconia fillers (Lava Ultimate, LU) and a resin-based composite with a similar resin matrix-to-filler ratio but without zirconia fillers (Tetric N-Ceram, TNC) were prepared into bars and assigned into four groups based on the type of aging treatment (hydrothermal aging, thermal cycling, water storage, or no aging). The phase transformations of the zirconia fillers in LU after aging were evaluated by X-ray diffraction. The flexural strength, Weibull modulus, flexural modulus, and Vickers hardness of each group were investigated. The fracture surface morphologies of both resin-based composites before and after aging were observed by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Only Tetragonal zirconia was detected in the LU samples. Both before and after aging, the flexural strength, flexural modulus, and Vickers hardness values of LU were significantly higher than those of TNC (p < 0.05) with the exception of the flexural modulus of LU, which showed no difference with that of TNC after water storage (p = 0.68). Hydrothermal aging, thermal cycling, and water storage had no significant effects on the surface Vickers hardnesses of LU or TNC (p > 0.05). Hydrothermal aging significantly improved the flexural strength of LU (p = 0.00). Thermal cycling (p = 0.00) and water storage (p = 0.00) significantly decreased the flexural strength of LU. The flexural strength of TNC was not decreased by hydrothermal aging (p = 0.82) or water storage (p = 0.36), while it was decreased by thermal cycling (p = 0.00). The hydrothermal aging group of LU exhibited the highest Weibull modulus. CONCLUSIONS: The machinable resin-based composite containing nano-zirconia fillers provides superior flexural strength, flexural modulus, and Vickers hardness compared to the direct-filling resin-based composite with a similar resin matrix-to-filler ratio, although it fails to provide better aging resistance.",2020,0,1,
504, The fracture resistance of a CAD/CAM Resin Nano Ceramic (RNC) and a CAD ceramic at different thicknesses,"C. Chen, F. Z. Trindade, N. de Jager, C. J. Kleverlaan and A. J. Feilzer", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the influence of restoration thickness to the fracture resistance of adhesively bonded Lava™ Ultimate CAD/CAM, a Resin Nano Ceramic (RNC), and IPS e.max CAD ceramic. METHODS: Polished Lava™ Ultimate CAD/CAM (Group L), sandblasted Lava™ Ultimate CAD/CAM (Group LS), and sandblasted IPS e.max CAD (Group ES) discs (n=8, Ø=10 mm) with a thickness of respectively 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, and 3.0 mm were cemented to corresponding epoxy supporting discs, achieving a final thickness of 3.5 mm. All the 120 specimens were loaded with a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The load (N) at failure was recorded as fracture resistance. The stress distribution for 0.5 mm restorative discs of each group was analyzed by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The results of facture resistances were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and regression. RESULTS: For the same thickness of testing discs, the fracture resistance of Group L was always significantly lower than the other two groups. The 0.5 mm discs in Group L resulted in the lowest value of 1028 (112) N. There was no significant difference between Group LS and Group ES when the restoration thickness ranged between 1.0 mm and 2.0 mm. There was a linear relation between fracture resistance and restoration thickness in Group L (R=0.621, P<0.001) and in Group ES (R=0.854, P<0.001). FEA showed a compressive permanent damage in all groups. SIGNIFICANCE: The materials tested in this in vitro study with the thickness above 0.5 mm could afford the normal bite force. When Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM is used, sandblasting is suggested to get a better bonding.",2014,1,0,
292, Influence of accelerated ageing on the physical properties of CAD/CAM restorative materials,"T. Niem, N. Youssef and B. Wöstmann", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the influence of thermocycling on the physical properties of different CAD/CAM restorative materials and assess their ability to maintain energy dissipation capacities and damping effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of a 3-point bending test were used to calculate flexural strength (FS), modulus of elasticity (ME), modulus of toughness (MT) and elastic recovery (ER) for three ceramic, twelve composite and five polymer-based materials. Specimens (n = 10, 4.0 × 1.5 × 17.0 mm(3)) were loaded until rupture after water storage (24 h; 37.0 ± 1.0 °C) or thermocycling (5000 cycles; 5-55 °C). Statistical data analysis was performed using parametric statistics (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Thermocycling had no significant influence on any investigated properties of ceramic materials (p > 0.05). Hybrid composites showed significant differences between water storage and thermocycling (p < 0.05), with the exception of FS of Tetric CAD. Similarly, ME with AMBARINO High-Class, CERASMART, Tetric CAD and Vita Enamic and MT and ER with Paradigm and Tetric CAD were not affected. For polymer-based materials, significant differences were found with the exceptions of FS (PEEK-OPTIMA, Telio CAD), ME (M-PM Disc, PEEK-OPTIMA, Telio CAD, Vita CAD-Temp), MT (Telio CAD) and ER (Telio CAD). CONCLUSIONS: The material properties of composite and polymer-based CAD/CAM materials were susceptible to degradation processes induced by thermocycling. Only Telio CAD and Tetric CAD showed no significant effects like all ceramic materials, thus preserving their inherent ability to elastically and plastically dissipate energy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A careful material selection is advisable when planning CAD/CAM restorations as remarkable differences may exist in the durability of physical characteristics through the impact of water.",2020,0,1,
220, Fatigue resistance and failure mode of adhesively restored custom implant zirconia abutments,"E. Oderich, L. L. Boff, A. C. Cardoso and P. Magne", Clin Oral Implants Res," OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the fatigue resistance and failure mode of porcelain and composite resin crowns and onlays bonded to premolar custom zirconia implant abutments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty standardized zirconia implant abutments were milled (NeoShape) according to two different restoration designs (onlay or crown). Using Cerec 3, the corresponding onlays and crowns were fabricated either in ceramic (Paradigm C) or composite resin (Paradigm MZ100), resulting in four experimental groups (n = 15). The fitting surfaces of the abutments were airborne-particle abraded and cleaned. The intaglio surfaces of the restorations were HF-etched and silanated (Paradigm C) or airborne-particle abraded and silanated (Paradigm MZ100). Following insertion of the abutments into a Morse taper implant (Titamax CM), all restorations were bonded with a zirconia primer (Z-Prime Plus), adhesive resin (Optibond FL), and a preheated light curing composite resin (Filtek Z100). Cyclic isometric chewing (5 Hz) was simulated, starting with a load of 50N (5000×), followed by stages of 200N, 400N, 600N, 800N, 1000N, 1200N, and 1400N (25,000× each). Samples were loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 180,000 cycles. The four groups were compared using the life table survival analysis (Logrank test at P = 0.05). RESULTS: All composite resin onlays and crowns survived (100% survival rate), while ceramic ones fractured at an average load of 1347N and 1280N, respectively, (survival rate of 46.7% and 20%) with a significant difference in survival probability (P < 0.0001). Fractures consisted in partial or total failure of the restoration only (no abutment failure, no screw loosening). CONCLUSIONS: Composite resin onlays and crowns bonded to custom zirconia implant abutments presented a significant higher survival rate when compared to ceramic onlays and crowns.",2012,0,1,
222, Fatigue resistance and failure mode of CAD/CAM composite resin implant abutments restored with type III composite resin and porcelain veneers,"P. Magne, E. Oderich, L. L. Boff, A. C. Cardoso and U. C. Belser", Clin Oral Implants Res," OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the fatigue resistance and failure mode of type III porcelain and composite resin veneers bonded to custom composite resin implant abutments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the CEREC 3 machine, 28 composite resin implant abutments (Paradigm MZ100) were fabricated along with non-retentive type III veneers, milled either in ceramic Paradigm C (n=14) or in composite resin Paradigm MZ100 (n=14). The intaglio surfaces of the veneers were hydrofluoric acid etched and silanated (Paradigm C) or airborne-particle abraded and silanated (MZ100). The fitting surface of the abutments was airborne-particle abraded, cleaned, silanated and inserted into a bone level implant (10 mm, BLI RC). All veneers were luted with adhesive resin (Optibond FL) and a preheated light curing composite resin (Filtek Z100). Cyclic isometric chewing (5 Hz, 30° angle) was simulated, starting with a load of 40 N, followed by stages of 80, 120, 160, 200, 240 and 280 N (20,000 cycles each). Samples were loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 140,000 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table survival analysis (Log rank test at P=0.05). Previously published data using same-design zirconia abutments were included for comparison. RESULTS: Paradigm C and MZ100 specimens fractured at an average load of 243 and 206 N (survival rate of 21% and 0%), respectively, with a significant difference in survival probability (P=0.02). Fractured specimens presented mixed failure modes and solely adhesive failures were not observed. The survival of composite resin abutments was similar to that of identical zirconia abutments from a previous study (P=0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Non-retentive porcelain veneers bonded to custom composite resin implant abutments presented a higher survival rate when compared with composite resin veneers. Survival of composite resin abutment did not differ from zirconia ones.",2011,0,1,
223, Fatigue resistance and failure mode of novel-design anterior single-tooth implant restorations: influence of material selection for type III veneers bonded to zirconia abutments,"P. Magne, M. P. Paranhos, L. H. Burnett, Jr., M. Magne and U. C. Belser", Clin Oral Implants Res," OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the fatigue resistance and failure mode of type III porcelain and composite resin veneers bonded to custom zirconia implant abutments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four standardized zirconia implant abutments were fabricated. Using the CEREC 3 machine, type III veneers of standardized shape were milled in ceramic Vita Mark II or in composite resin Paradigm MZ100. The intaglio surfaces of the restorations were hydrofluoric acid etched and silanated (Mark II) or airborne-particle abraded and silanated (MZ100). The fitting surface of the abutments was airborne-particle abraded, cleaned, and inserted into a bone level implant (BLI RC SLActive 10 mm). All veneers (n=24) were adhesively luted with a zirconia primer (Z-Prime Plus), adhesive resin (Optibond FL) and a pre-heated light-curing composite resin (Filtek Z100). Cyclic isometric chewing (5 Hz) was simulated, starting with a load of 40 N, followed by stages of 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, and 280 N (20,000 cycles each). Samples were loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 140,000 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table survival analysis (Logrank test at P=.05). RESULTS: Mark II and MZ100 specimens fractured at an average load of 216 N and 229 N (survival rate of 17% and 8%), respectively, with no difference in survival probability (P=.18). Among the fractured samples, 40% of the failures were at the abutment level for Mark II and 27% were at the abutment level for MZ100. No exclusive adhesive failures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Type III Mark II and Paradigm MZ100 veneers showed similar fatigue resistance when bonded to custom non-retentive zirconia implant abutments. The bond was strong enough to induce abutment fractures. MZ100 presented a higher percentage of ""friendly"" failures, i.e. maintaining the restoration-abutment adhesive interface and the abutment itself intact.",2011,0,1,
383, Microtensile bond strength of CAD/CAM-fabricated polymer-ceramics to different adhesive resin cements,"L. Sadighpour, F. Geramipanah, Z. Ghasri and M. Neshatian", Restor Dent Endod," OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) of polymer-ceramic and indirect composite resin with 3 classes of resin cements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-fabricated polymer-ceramics (Enamic [ENA; Vita] and Lava Ultimate [LAV; 3M ESPE]) and a laboratory indirect composite resin (Gradia [GRA; GC Corp.]) were equally divided into 6 groups (n = 18) with 3 classes of resin cements: Variolink N (VAR; Vivadent), RelyX U200 (RXU; 3M ESPE), and Panavia F2 (PAN; Kuraray). The μTBS values were compared between groups by 2-way analysis of variance and the post hoc Tamhane test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Restorative materials and resin cements significantly influenced µTBS (p < 0.05). In the GRA group, the highest μTBS was found with RXU (27.40 ± 5.39 N) and the lowest with VAR (13.54 ± 6.04 N) (p < 0.05). Similar trends were observed in the ENA group. In the LAV group, the highest μTBS was observed with VAR (27.45 ± 5.84 N) and the lowest with PAN (10.67 ± 4.37 N) (p < 0.05). PAN had comparable results to those of ENA and GRA, whereas the μTBS values were significantly lower with LAV (p = 0.001). The highest bond strength of RXU was found with GRA (27.40 ± 5.39 N, p = 0.001). PAN showed the lowest µTBS with LAV (10.67 ± 4.37 N; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When applied according to the manufacturers' recommendations, the µTBS of polymer-ceramic CAD/CAM materials and indirect composites is influenced by the luting cements.",2018,1,1,
440, Restorative CAD/CAM materials in dentistry: analysis of their fluorescence properties and the applicability of the fluorescence-aided identification technique (FIT),"C. Klein, M. Krespach, S. Spintzyk, D. Wolff, C. von Ohle and C. Meller", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the fluorescence properties of the most commonly used fluorescent CAD/CAM materials for monolithic dental restorations and their suitability to perform the fluorescence-aided identification technique (FIT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 175 different color shades (n = 1) from 13 CAD/CAM material brands were analyzed with a monochromator-based microplate reader. Additionally, dentin, enamel, and combined dentin-enamel specimens (respectively, n = 11) were analyzed for comparison purposes. The maximum fluorescence intensity, the corresponding excitation and emission wavelength, and the total fluorescence for the wavelength spectrum λ(ex) = 395 nm - 415 nm used for FIT were determined. RESULTS: All assessed CAD/CAM ceramics showed virtually no total fluorescence for the wavelength spectrum λ(ex) = 395 nm - 415 nm used for FIT. CERASMART(TM), KZR-CAD HD 2, and LuxaCam Composite displayed total fluorescence values similar to that of the tooth hard substances. All other resin-based CAD/CAM materials showed a significantly higher total fluorescence than the tooth hard substances. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the mentioned exceptions, all CAD/CAM materials assessed could be suitable for the FIT, either because they are more fluorescent than hard tooth substances or because they do not fluoresce at all at the respective wavelength of λ(ex) = 395 nm - 415 nm. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides insight into the not yet well-known fluorescent properties of dental CAD/CAM materials. This knowledge is not only necessary to reproduce the fluorescence properties of natural teeth but also for the applicability of diagnostic fluorescence inducing techniques.",2021,0,1,
313, Influence of proximal box elevation on the marginal quality and fracture behavior of root-filled molars restored with CAD/CAM ceramic or composite onlays,"I. Ilgenstein, N. U. Zitzmann, J. Bühler, F. J. Wegehaupt, T. Attin, R. Weiger and G. Krastl", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the influence of proximal box elevation (PBE) with composite resin when applied to deep proximal defects in root-filled molars with mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) cavities, which were subsequently restored with computer-aided designed/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) ceramic or composite restorations. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Root canal treatment was performed on 48 human mandibular molars. Standardized MOD cavities were prepared with the distal box located 2 mm below the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). The teeth were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups (n = 12). In groups G1 and G2, the distal proximal box was elevated up to the level of the CEJ with composite resin (PBE). No elevation was performed in the remaining two groups (G3, G4). CAD/CAM restorations were fabricated with feldspathic ceramic (Vita Mark II, CER) in groups G1 (PBE-CER) and G3 (CER) or with resin nano-ceramic blocks (Lava Ultimate, LAV) in groups G2 (PBE-LAV) and G4 (LAV). Replicas were taken before and after thermomechanical loading (TML; 1.2 Mio cycles; 49 N; 3,000 thermocycles between 50 °C and 5 °C). Following TML, load was applied until failure. Fracture analysis was performed under a stereomicroscope (×16). Marginal quality before and after TML (tooth restoration, composite restoration) was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (×200). RESULTS: After TML, lower percentages of continuous margins were observed in groups G1-G3 compared with pre-TML assessments; however, the differences were not statistically significant. For group G4-LAV, the marginal quality after TML was significantly better than in any other group. The highest mean fracture value was recorded for group G4. No significant difference was found for this value between the groups with PBE compared with the groups without PBE, regardless of the material used. The specimens restored with ceramic onlays exhibited fractures that were mainly restricted to the restoration while, in teeth restored with composite onlays, the percentage of catastrophic failures (fractures beyond bone level) was increased. CONCLUSION: PBE had no impact on either the marginal integrity or the fracture behavior of root canal-treated mandibular molars restored with feldspathic ceramic onlays. CAD/CAM-fabricated composite onlays were more favorable than ceramic onlays in terms of both marginal quality and fracture resistance, particularly in specimens without PBE. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Composite onlays with or without PBE may be a viable approach for the restoration of root-filled molars with subgingival MOD cavities.",2015,1,1,
483, Tensile bond strength of resin composite repair in vitro using different surface preparation conditionings to an aged CAD/CAM resin nanoceramic,"B. Stawarczyk, A. Krawczuk and N. Ilie", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted in order to assess the pretreatment method (air abrasion, both wet and dry, and Al2O3 grinder), the conditioning method (comprised of different adhesive systems), the repair resin composite (low and high modulus of elasticity), the contamination of CoJet air-abraded surfaces with water, and the effect phosphoric acid on the macrotensile bond strength (TBS) to aged CAD/CAM resin nanoceramic (RNC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aged RNC substrates (LAVA Ultimate, 3M ESPE; N = 900; 10,000 cycles, 5 °C/55 °C) were air-abraded (CoJet 3M ESPE) with and without water contamination or treated with an Al2O3 grinder (Cimara, Voco). Immediately after pretreatment, half of the specimens were additionally cleaned with phosphoric acid, while the rest were only rinsed with water. Four intermediate agents (Futurabond U/VOCO, Scotchbond Universal/3M ESPE, One Coat Bond/Coltène Whaledent, visio.link/bredent) were selected for conditioning the surface, while no conditioned specimens acted as control groups. Specimens were thereafter repaired using two direct resin composites (Arabesk Top and GrandioSo, VOCO), stored for 24 h at 37 °C in H2O, and thermally aged for 10,000 cycles (5 °C/55 °C; n = 15/subgroup). TBS and failure types were determined and evaluated with four- and one-way ANOVA and χ (2) test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The highest influence on TBS was exerted by the conditioning method (partial eta-squared (η P (2)) = 0.273, p < 0.05), followed by the resin composite repair (η P (2) = 0.07, p < 0.05) and the surface pretreatment method (η P (2) = 0.032, p < 0.05), while an acid contamination after surface pretreatment was insignificant (p = 0.154). CONCLUSIONS: Air abrasion produced superior TBS compared to grinding of the surface with Al2O3 prior to repair. The tested universal adhesives proved to be effective intermediate agents for repairing aged CAD/CAM RNC, while visio.link and Scotchbond Universal performed slightly better than Futurabond U. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Phosphoric acid or water contamination of the air-abraded surface does not affect the repair bond strength.",2015,1,0,
260, Grinding damage assessment for CAD-CAM restorative materials,"P. Curran, M. Cattani-Lorente, H. W. Anselm Wiskott, S. Durual and S. S. Scherrer", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: To assess surface/subsurface damage after grinding with diamond discs on five CAD-CAM restorative materials and to estimate potential losses in strength based on crack size measurements of the generated damage. METHODS: The materials tested were: Lithium disilicate (LIT) glass-ceramic (e.max CAD), leucite glass-ceramic (LEU) (Empress CAD), feldspar ceramic (VM2) (Vita Mark II), feldspar ceramic-resin infiltrated (EN) (Enamic) and a composite reinforced with nano ceramics (LU) (Lava Ultimate). Specimens were cut from CAD-CAM blocs and pair-wise mirror polished for the bonded interface technique. Top surfaces were ground with diamond discs of respectively 75, 54 and 18μm. Chip damage was measured on the bonded interface using SEM. Fracture mechanics relationships were used to estimate fracture stresses based on average and maximum chip depths assuming these to represent strength limiting flaws subjected to tension and to calculate potential losses in strength compared to manufacturer's data. RESULTS: Grinding with a 75μm diamond disc induced on a bonded interface critical chips averaging 100μm with a potential strength loss estimated between 33% and 54% for all three glass-ceramics (LIT, LEU, VM2). The softer materials EN and LU were little damage susceptible with chips averaging respectively 26μm and 17μm with no loss in strength. Grinding with 18μm diamond discs was still quite detrimental for LIT with average chip sizes of 43μm and a potential strength loss of 42%. SIGNIFICANCE: It is essential to understand that when grinding glass-ceramics or feldspar ceramics with diamond discs surface and subsurface damage are induced which have the potential of lowering the strength of the ceramic. Careful polishing steps should be carried out after grinding especially when dealing with glass-ceramics.",2017,1,1,
219, Fatigue resistance and crack propensity of large MOD composite resin restorations: direct versus CAD/CAM inlays,"S. Batalha-Silva, M. A. de Andrada, H. P. Maia and P. Magne", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of material/technique selection (direct vs. CAD/CAM inlays) for large MOD composite adhesive restorations and its effect on the crack propensity and in vitro accelerated fatigue resistance. METHODS: A standardized MOD slot-type tooth preparation was applied to 32 extracted maxillary molars (5mm depth and 5mm bucco-palatal width) including immediately sealed dentin for the inlay group. Fifteen teeth were restored with direct composite resin restoration (Miris2) and 17 teeth received milled inlays using Paradigm MZ100 block in the CEREC machine. All inlays were adhesively luted with a light curing composite resin (Filtek Z100). Enamel shrinkage-induced cracks were tracked with photography and transillumination. Cyclic isometric chewing (5 Hz) was simulated, starting with a load of 200 N (5000 cycles), followed by stages of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400 N at a maximum of 30,000 cycles each. Samples were loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 185,000 cycles. RESULTS: Teeth restored with the direct technique fractured at an average load of 1213 N and two of them withstood all loading cycles (survival=13%); with inlays, the survival rate was 100%. Most failures with Miris2 occurred above the CEJ and were re-restorable (67%), but generated more shrinkage-induced cracks (47% of the specimen vs. 7% for inlays). SIGNIFICANCE: CAD/CAM MZ100 inlays increased the accelerated fatigue resistance and decreased the crack propensity of large MOD restorations when compared to direct restorations. While both restorative techniques yielded excellent fatigue results at physiological masticatory loads, CAD/CAM inlays seem more indicated for high-load patients.",2013,0,1,
50, Bonding potential of self-adhesive luting agents used at different temperatures to lute composite onlays,"A. Cantoro, C. Goracci, C. A. Carvalho, I. Coniglio and M. Ferrari", J Dent," OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the bonding potential to dentin of self-adhesive resin cements was affected by their pre-cure temperature. METHODS: Composite overlays (Paradigm MZ100, 3M ESPE) were luted on 100 extracted molars with G-Cem (GC Corp.), BisCem (Bisco), Multilink Sprint (Ivoclar Vivadent), SAC-A (Kuraray Co.), XP Bond/Calibra (Detrey Dentsply). The cements were used at pre-cure temperatures that recur in their handling (4 degrees C refrigerator, 24 degrees C room and 37 degrees C intraoral), as well as following pre-heating up to 60 degrees C. Microtensile bond strengths to dentin were measured and compared with statistical tests. Scanning electron microscope observations of cement-dentin interfaces were performed. RESULTS: The bond strength of G-Cem and Calibra was not significantly affected by temperature changes from refrigerator storage to intraoral application. At any assessed pre-cure temperature the total-etch luting agent Calibra achieved a significantly stronger adhesion than the auto-adhesive cements. Limited to null adhesion was yielded by BisCem and SAC-A. The procedure of 60 degrees C pre-heating, proposed in previous studies for restorative resin composites, was of no use for the tested luting agents. Only the total-etch luting agent Calibra developed a distinct hybrid layer. The self-adhesive cements exhibited a more superficial interaction with dentin. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the pre-cure temperature, the bonding potential of the self-adhesive resin cements was inferior to that of the total-etch luting agent tested as control. The adhesive properties of the BisCem and SAC-A were extremely scarce.",2009,0,1,
150, Effect of pre-cure temperature on the bonding potential of self-etch and self-adhesive resin cements,"A. Cantoro, C. Goracci, F. Papacchini, C. Mazzitelli, G. M. Fadda and M. Ferrari", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the pre-cure temperature of resin cements significantly influenced the bonding potential to dentin. METHODS: Forty extracted molars were randomly divided into 8 groups (n=5): Groups (1-4) RelyX Unicem (RU, 3 M ESPE) and Groups (5-8) Panavia F 2.0 (PF, Kuraray Co.), at pre-cure temperatures of 4, 24, 37, and 60 degrees C, respectively. Cements were used in dual-cure mode for luting composite overlays (Paradigm MZ100, 3 M ESPE) to dentin. Microtensile bond strength testing and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of cement-dentin interfaces were performed. RESULTS: Group 4 had to be eliminated as RU at 60 degrees C underwent such an accelerated curing that was already set at the time of dispensing. The bond strengths (MPa) measured at refrigerator, room, and intraoral temperature were, respectively: RU 5.4+/-1.7, 11.4+/-6.1, 10.6+/-4.2; PF 7.4+/-3.7, 13.9+/-6.2, 12+/-5.2. The statistical analysis revealed that both luting agents developed a significantly weaker adhesion when used at refrigerator temperature (p<0.05). No statistically significant differences in bond strength were recorded when either cement was used at 24 or 37 degrees C (p>0.05). Pre-heating of PF to 60 degrees C resulted in a significant increase in bond strength (20.7+/-9.4 MPa; p<0.05). SEM observations disclosed an enhanced potential of PF to form a hybrid layer as the temperature increased over 4 degrees C. RU exhibited a less porous and more homogeneous layer at intraoral than at refrigerated temperature. SIGNIFICANCE: It is advisable to let refrigerator-stored resin cements warm up to at least room temperature prior to clinical use. Pre-heating to 60 degrees C enhances the bonding potential of PF.",2008,0,1,

Martin", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: To characterise the mechanical properties of the machinable polymers Pekkton(®) (Cendres-Meteaux, Biel/Bienne, Switzerland), Lava Ultimate(®) (3MESPE, Seefeld, Germany), Vita Enamic(®) (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) and the ceramic IPS e.Max Press(®) (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). To determine the structural integrity of full coverage crowns fabricated from these materials. METHODS: The following tests were conducted: Biaxial flexural strength (BFS) using the piston on 3 balls jig (n=10); Vickers Hardness (VH) 10 indentations per sample with 10kg load & 20s dwell time (n=5); Hygroscopic Expansion Change (HEC) in artificial saliva over 68 days (n=5). Structural Strength (SS) of teeth analogues (n=20) restored with monolithic crowns from the four materials. Mean values and standard deviations for BFS, VH, HEC and SS tests were calculated and compared using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's test at a level of 5% significance. RESULTS: BFS: IPS e.Max Press(®) (317MPa±37MPa), Pekkton(®) (227MPa±18MPa), Lava Ultimate(®) (145MPa±18MPa) and Vita Enamic(®) (137MPa±7MPa) with a significance between groups of p<0.0001. VH: IPS e.Max Press(®) (5064MPa±131MPa), Vita Enamic(®) (1976MPa±12MPa), Lava Ultimate(®) (924MPa±27MPa) and Pekkton(®) (445MPa±21MPa) with a significance between groups of p<0.0001. HEC (%vol change): Pekkton(®) (0.14%±0.14%), Vita Enamic(®) (0.38%±0.16%) and Lava Ultimate(®) (1.06%±0.17%). SS for full-coverage crowns: Pekkton(®) (2037N±49N no fracture), IPS e.Max Press(®) (1497N±165N), Lava Ultimate(®) (1476N±142N) and Vita Enamic(®) (1127N±108N). SIGNIFICANCE: The properties investigated suggest that full coverage monolithic PEKK crowns possess adequate mechanical and physical properties for use in the posterior region of the mouth. These results must be considered alongside other data including clinical studies.",2018,0,0,
68, Characterization of a polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network material,"A. Della Bona, P. H. Corazza and Y. Zhang", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: To characterize the microstructure and determine some mechanical properties of a polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) material (Vita Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik) available for CAD-CAM systems. METHODS: Specimens were fabricated to perform quantitative and qualitative analyses of the material's microstructure and to determine the fracture toughness (KIc), density (ρ), Poisson's ratio (ν) and Young's modulus (E). KIc was determined using V-notched specimens and the short beam toughness method, where bar-shaped specimens were notched and 3-point loaded to fracture. ρ was calculated using Archimedes principle, and ν and E were measured using an ultrasonic thickness gauge with a combination of a pulse generator and an oscilloscope. RESULTS: Microstructural analyses showed a ceramic- and a polymer-based interpenetrating network. Mean and standard deviation values for the properties evaluated were: KIc=1.09±0.05MPam(1/2), ρ=2.09±0.01g/cm(3), ν=0.23±0.002 and E=37.95±0.34GPa. SIGNIFICANCE: The PICN material showed mechanical properties between porcelains and resin-based composites, reflecting its microstructural components.",2014,1,0,
196, Estimation of stress distribution and risk of failure for maxillary premolar restored by occlusal veneer with different CAD/CAM materials and preparation designs,"X. Q. Huang, N. R. Hong, L. Y. Zou, S. Y. Wu and Y. Li", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: To compare stress distribution and failure probability in maxillary premolars restored by simple occlusal veneer (SOV) and buccal-occlusal veneer (BOV) with 3 different CAD/CAM materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A maxillary premolar was digitized by a micro-CT scanner. Three-dimensional dynamic scan data were transformed, and finite element models of 2 different models (SOV and BOV restored teeth) were designed. Three different CAD/CAM materials, including lithium disilicate glass ceramic (LD) IPS e.max CAD, polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) Vita Enamic, and resin nano-ceramic (RNC) Lava Ultimate, were designated to both veneers. Maximum principle stresses were determined by applying a 300-N axial load to the occlusal surface. Weibull analyses were performed to calculate the failure probability of the models. RESULTS: LD-restored teeth showed the highest stress in the veneer, lowest stress in substrate teeth, and lowest failure probability for the overall system; RNC-restored teeth showed the lowest stress in the veneer, highest stress in substrate teeth, and highest failure probability. No significant differences were found in the cement layer among the different models. No significant differences of stress and failure probability existed between SOV and BOV preparations. CONCLUSIONS: CAD/CAM composite resin occlusal veneers bear lower maximum stress than ceramic veneers. Teeth restored by composite veneers are more prone to failure than those restored by ceramic veneers. Additional reduction of the buccal surface did not increase the stress on the occlusal veneer under axial load. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Both occlusal veneers could be used under physiological masticatory force. CAD/CAM glass ceramic was safer than composite resins.",2020,1,0,
95, Composite vs ceramic computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacturing crowns in endodontically treated teeth: analysis of marginal adaptation,"A. Ramírez-Sebastià, T. Bortolotto, M. Roig and I. Krejci", Oper Dent," OBJECTIVES: To compare the marginal adaptation between ceramic and composite CEREC crowns in endodontically treated teeth restored with endocrowns or with a short or a long post. METHODOLOGY: Forty-eight intact maxillary incisors were used. After endodontic treatment, the crowns were sectioned 2 mm coronally to the cemento-enamel junction, which provided a ferrule of 2 mm. The prepared teeth were divided randomly into six groups (n=8). Group 1 was restored with a large fiberglass post, composite core, and ceramic full-coverage computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM) crown. Group 2 was restored with a short fiberglass post, composite core, and ceramic full-coverage CAD-CAM crown. Group 3 was restored with a large fiberglass post, composite core, and composite full-coverage CAD-CAM crown (LPCpr). Group 4 was restored with a short fiberglass post, composite core, and composite full-coverage CAD-CAM crown (SPCpr). Groups 5 and 6 were restored with ceramic and composite CEREC machined endocrowns, respectively (EndoCer and EndoCpr). The restored teeth were loaded thermomechanically in a computer-controlled chewing machine. Impressions of each restoration were made in a polyvinylsiloxane material before and after loading. Gold-coated epoxy replicas were prepared for scanning electron microscopy examination at 200× magnification. RESULTS: Loading had a statistically significant effect (p<0.05) on the percentage of ""continuous margin"" in all groups. The LPCpr, SPCpr, and EndoCpr groups showed the highest percentage of continuous margin initially and after loading. The effect of the different post lengths on marginal adaptation was not significant (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: CAD-CAM crowns fabricated from millable composite resin blocks (Paradigm MZ100) offer a superior option to all-ceramic crowns (IPS Empress CAD).",2013,0,1,
113, Effect of a single-component ceramic conditioner on shear bond strength of precoated brackets to different CAD/CAM materials,"C. González-Serrano, J. H. Phark, M. V. Fuentes, A. Albaladejo, A. Sánchez-Monescillo, S. Duarte, Jr. and L. Ceballos", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: To compare the shear bond strength (SBS) of the CAD/CAM material-bracket interface using three surface treatments: following manufacturers' instructions (MI), Monobond Etch & Prime (MEP) and 9.6% hydrofluoric acid plus silane (9.6% HF), after 24 h of water storage (24 h) and 10,000 cycles of thermocycling (TC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 126 crowns with four identical buccal surfaces were fabricated using seven different CAD/CAM materials: CEREC Blocs unglazed (CBU), CEREC Blocs glazed (CBG), IPS Empress CAD (EMP), IPS e.max CAD (EMA), VITA SUPRINITY PC (SUP), inCoris TZI (TZI) and VITA ENAMIC (ENA). A total of 504 APC Flash-Free (APC FF)-precoated brackets were bonded applying three surface treatments: (1) MI; (2) MEP and (3) 9.6% HF. SBS was performed after 24 h and TC. Results were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS: MEP conditioning yielded lower SBS results compared with MI and 9.6% HF for CBG (24 h and TC) and EMA (TC) materials. EMP conditioning with MEP after 24 h obtained lower SBS values compared with MI; however, after TC, SBS was similar to MI group and higher than with 9.6% HF. After TC for TZI ceramic, MI protocol (sandblasting) obtained higher SBS scores than MEP, but similar than 9.6% HF. Treatment of ENA with MI and MEP produced higher results than 9.6% HF after TC. SBS results were similar for CBU and SUP, regardless of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although each CAD/CAM material requires specific surface treatment to obtain the highest SBS of APC FF brackets, the treatment with MEP is a valid orthodontic alternative for most of the materials tested. TC significantly decreased SBS for most of the materials. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: MEP can be considered a valid and promising product to condition most of the CAD/CAM ceramics evaluated for APC FF bracket bonding purposes, allowing a faster and safer procedure.",2021,0,0,
98, Curing mode affects bond strength of adhesively luted composite CAD/CAM restorations to dentin,"A. K. Lührs, P. Pongprueksa, J. De Munck, W. Geurtsen and B. Van Meerbeek", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of curing mode and restoration-surface pre-treatment on the micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) to dentin. METHODS: Sandblasted CAD/CAM composite blocks (LAVA Ultimate, 3M ESPE) were cemented to bur-cut dentin using either the etch & rinse composite cement Nexus 3 ('NX3', Kerr) with Optibond XTR ('XTR', Kerr), or the self-etch composite cement RelyX Ultimate ('RXU', 3M ESPE) with Scotchbond Universal ('SBU', 3M ESPE). All experimental groups included different 'curing modes' (light-curing of adhesive and cement ('LL'), light-curing of adhesive and auto-cure of cement ('LA'), co-cure of adhesive through light-curing of cement ('AL'), or complete auto-cure ('AA')) and different 'restoration-surface pre-treatments' of the composite block (NX3: either a silane primer (Kerr), or the XTR adhesive; RXU: either silane primer (RelyX Ceramic Primer, 3M ESPE) and SBU, or solely SBU). After water-storage (7 days, 37°C), the μTBS was measured. Additionally, the degree of conversion (DC) of both cements was measured after 10min and after 1 week, either auto-cured (21°C/37°C) or light-cured (directly/through 3-mm CAD/CAM composite). RESULTS: The linear mixed-effects model (α=0.05) revealed a significant influence of the factors 'curing mode' and 'composite cement', and a less significant effect of the factor 'restoration-surface pre-treatment'. Light-curing 'LL' revealed the highest μTBS, which decreased significantly for all other curing modes. For curing modes 'AA' and 'AL', the lowest μTBS and a high percentage of pre-testing failures were reported. Overall, DC increased with light-curing and incubation time. SIGNIFICANCE: The curing mode is decisive for the bonding effectiveness of adhesively luted composite CAD/CAM restorations to dentin.",2014,0,1,
486, The effect of artificial aging on Martens hardness and indentation modulus of different dental CAD/CAM restorative materials,"R. Hampe, N. Lümkemann, B. Sener and B. Stawarczyk", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVES: To determine the Martens hardness parameters for five different classes of CAD/CAM restorative materials after storage in water and thermo-cycling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lithium disilicate ceramic IPS e.max CAD (EX), silicate ceramic IPS Empress CAD (EC), a polymer infiltrated interpenetrating network material (hybrid material) VITA Enamic (VE), two compact filled composites Lava Ultimate (LU), experimental material (EM), two low filled resin composites Katana Avencia (KA), Ambarino High-Class (AH) and ultra-low/unfilled acrylic polymers CAD-Temp (CT), Telio CAD (TC), breCAM.HIPC (BC) were tested. Specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 30, 60, 90, 120 days and afterwards thermo-cycled (30,000×, 5 °C/55 °C). Martens hardness (HM) and indentation modulus (E(IT)) were longitudinally investigated after each storage time. For structural analysis, each material was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). RESULTS: The groups of unfilled polymers/ultra-low filled composite (CT, TC, BC) followed by low (KA, AH) and compact filled resin composites (LU, EM) showed the lowest HM and E(IT) values (p < 0.001). The highest values presented ceramics (EX, EC) followed by hybrid material (VE) (p < 0.001). High influence on the Martens hardness parameters was exerted by the aging duration (HM: η(P)(2) = 0.108, p < 0.001; E(IT): η(P)(2) = 0.074, p < 0.001). Structural analyses of resin composites revealed big differences in shape, size and distribution of filler particles. CONCLUSIONS: The tested CAD/CAM materials showed differences in Martens hardness and indentation modulus pursuant to the material class. Ceramics showed highest values, followed by the hybrid material. For resin composites the Martens hardness and indentation modulus increased with the filler content. Artificial aging affected CAD/CAM materials differently. Some materials tested are prone to aging, the Martens hardness and indentation modulus decreased after thermo-cycling.",2018,0,1,
201, Evaluation of mechanical and optical behavior of current esthetic dental restorative CAD/CAM composites,"B. Stawarczyk, A. Liebermann, M. Eichberger and J. F. Güth", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVES: To determine the mechanical and optical properties of CAD/CAM composites (LAVA Ultimate, Cerasmart, Shofu Block and two exp. CAD/CAM composites), a hybrid material (VITA Enamic), a leucite (IPS Empress CAD) and a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-point flexural strength (FS) was investigated according ISO 6872:2008 (N=240/n=30). Two-body wear (TBW) was analyzed in a chewing simulator (1,200,000 cycles, 50N, 5°/55°C) using human teeth as antagonists (N=120/n=15). Quantitative analysis of wear was carried out with a 3D-scanner and associated matching software. Discoloration rate (DR) after 14 days of storage in cress, curry, red wine, and distilled water (N=384/n=12), and translucency (T) (N=384/n=48) of CAD/CAM materials were measured in a spectrophotometer (400-700nm wavelength). Data were analyzed using two-/one-way ANOVA with Scheffé post-hoc test, Kruskal-Wallis-H test, and linear mixed models (α=0.05). RESULTS: IPS e.max CAD showed the highest FS (p<0.001), followed by LAVA Ultimate; however, not different from the remaining CAD/CAM composites (exception: Shofu Block). The lowest FS showed VITA Enamic and IPS Empress CAD (p<0.001). IPS Empress CAD, VITA Enamic, exp. CAD/CAM composite 2, followed by IPS e.max presented lower material TBW than the remaining CAD/CAM materials (p<0.001). The highest antagonist wear was observed for the tested glass-ceramics and the hybrid material (p<0.001). Storage medium (red wine>curry>cress>distilled water) exerted the highest influence on DR (p<0.001), closely followed by CAD/CAM material. Glass-ceramics showed lower DR than CAD/CAM composites (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CAD/CAM composites presented moderate FS, high T and antagonist friendly behavior. Glass-ceramic demonstrated the most favorable DR and lowest TBW on the material side.",2015,0,1,
255, Fracture Toughness Analysis of Ceramic and Resin Composite CAD/CAM Material,"R. Hampe, B. Theelke, N. Lümkemann, M. Eichberger and B. Stawarczyk", Oper Dent," OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the fracture toughness of dental CAD/CAM materials of different material classes intended for in-office milling (glass ceramics, hybrid, resin composites) and the influence of aging on this property. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The fracture toughness (critical intensity factor, K(Ic)) values of 9 CAD/CAM restorative materials (Ambarino High-Class, Brilliant Crios, Cerasmart, exp. CAD/CAM composite, Katana Avencia, Lava Ultimate, VITA Enamic, IPS Empress CAD, and IPS e.max CAD) were determined using the SEVNB method in a four-point bending setup. Twenty bending bars of each material with a 4 × 3 cross and a minimum length of 12 mm were cut out of CAD/CAM milling blocks. Notching was done starting with a pre-cut and consecutive polishing and v-shaping with a razor blade, resulting in a final depth of v-shaped notches of between 0.8 and 1.2 mm. Half of the specimens were selected for initial fracture toughness measurements. The others were thermocycled in distilled water for 30,000× (5/55°C; 30-second dwell time) before testing. Specimen fracture surfaces were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: All specimens for each material fractured into two fragments and showed the typical compression curl and brittle failure markings. Comparing initial K(Ic) values, lithium disilicate ceramic IPS e.max CAD showed significantly the highest and leucite-reinforced ceramic IPS Empress CAD significantly the lowest K(Ic) values (p<0.001). All tested CAD/CAM materials with a resin component ranged in the same K(Ic) value group (p>0.999-0.060). After thermal cycling, the highest K(Ic) values were measured for lithium disilicate ceramic IPS e.max CAD, followed by resin composite materials Ambarino High-Class (p<0.001-0.006) and hybrid material VITA Enamic (p<0.001-0.016), while the significantly lowest values were reflected for the resin composite materials Cerasmart, LAVA Ultimate (p<0.001-0.006), and Katana Avencia (p<0.001-0.009). The roughness of the fracture surfaces varied depending on the microstructure of the respective material. The ceramic surfaces showed the smoothest surfaces. The fracture surface of VITA Enamic revealed microstructural inhomogeneities and microcracks. For CAD/CAM resin composite materials, crack paths through the matrix and interfaces of matrix and fillers could be observed at the microstructure level. CONCLUSIONS: The materials tested show differences in fracture toughness typical for the class they belong to. With one exception (Ambarino High-Class), thermocycling affected the fracture toughness of materials with a resin component negatively, whereas the leucite and lithium disilicate ceramic showed stability.",2019,0,1,
157, Effect of Staining and Aging on Translucency Parameter of CAD-CAM Materials,"R. N. Tango, A. Todorović, D. Stamenković, D. N. Karasan, I. Sailer and R. D. Paravina", Acta Stomatol Croat," OBJECTIVES: To evaluate different intervals of exposure to staining solutions and artificial aging on translucency parameter (TP(00)) of CAD-CAM materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One millimeter thick square-shaped specimens (N = 288) were cut from Cerasmart (CS), IPS e.max (IE), Lava Ultimate (LU), Shofu HC (SH), Vita Enamic (VE), and Vita Suprinity (VS) and were divided into laboratory and chairside polishing. Reflection wavelength spectra, CIE D65 standard illuminant, 2 ° standard observer, SCI, UV included, SAV aperture, 6 mm diameter, were recorded at 10 nm sensitivity against white and black calibration tiles using a benchtop spectrophotometer. Subsequently, they were converted into CIEDE 2000 TP(00). After baseline measurements (T0), the specimens were divided as follows (n = 8): staining in coffee (C) and wine (W), for 60 (T1) and 120 hours (T2), and accelerated artificial aging (A). Artificial aging (ISO 4892-2 standard) was performed in two cycles of 150 KJ/m(2), for T1 and T2, respectively. TP measurements were repeated at T1 and T2. Data of TP(00) retention were submitted to analysis of variance and Fisher's PLSD multiple comparison test (α=0.05). RESULTS: Fisher's PLSD critical differences among materials, time intervals and staining/aging were 0.16, 0.11 and 0.11, respectively. SH showed the highest TP(00) followed by LU > CS > IE = VS > VE. For all time intervals, the lowest TP(00) retention was observed with C. W, and A presented similar values. CONCLUSIONS: Translucency Parameter was a time and staining/aging-dependent material. In majority of cases, it decreased upon staining/aging.",2021,0,0,
12, A 2-year Retrospective Clinical study of Enamic Crowns Performed in a Private Practice Setting,"G. Chirumamilla, C. E. Goldstein and N. C. Lawson", J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical performance and survival of Enamic crowns placed in a prosthodontic dental practice. METHODS: Thirty-five patients and 45 crowns were included in the study. At 1-year recall appointments, the restorations were examined for survival. At the 2-year recall appointment, all restorations were clinically evaluated by an independent evaluator for CDA clinical criteria. Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test were used to compare the survival of the restorations placed with resin and resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) cements. RESULTS: Out of the 45 crowns that were followed, 2 were lost to follow-up by 1 year and 7 were lost to follow-up by 2 years. Severe complications were observed in 2 teeth by the 2-year follow-up and were recorded as failures due to recurrent decay, and an internal crack in the abutment tooth. There was no difference between the survival probability for crowns cemented with resin cement (96.8%) and with RMGI cements (92.9%) (p = 0.42), however, 1 out of the 14 crowns cemented with RMGI cement debonded. The crowns were evaluated according the CDA criteria with over 90% alfa scores for all categories aside from surface texture (86% alfa). CONCLUSION: The estimated 2-year survival of Enamic crowns is >90%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the preliminary 2-year results achieved in a clinical practice, Enamic is a suitable material for full-coverage single-unit crowns. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the long term success. (J Esthet Restor Dent 28:231-237, 2016).",2016,0,0,
384, Microtensile Bond Strength of Composite Cement to Novel CAD/CAM Materials as a Function of Surface Treatment and Aging,"D. P. Lise, A. Van Ende, J. De Munck, L. Vieira, L. N. Baratieri and B. Van Meerbeek", Oper Dent," OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on the bond strength to a composite and a polymer-infiltrated ceramic CAD/CAM block after six-month artificial aging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two types of CAD/CAM blocks (Cerasmart, GC; Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik) were cut in slabs of 4-mm thickness, divided into six groups, and subjected to the following surface treatments: group 1: no treatment; group 2: sandblasting (SB); group 3: SB + silane (Si); group 4: SB + Si + flowable composite (see below); group 5: 5% hydrofluoric acid etching (HF) + Si; and group 6: 37% phosphoric acid etching (H(3)PO(4)) + Si. Sections of the same group were luted together (n=3: 3 sandwich specimens/group) using a dual-cure self-adhesive cement for all groups, except for the sections of group 4 that were luted using a light-curing flowable composite. After three weeks of storage in 0.5% chloramine at 37°C, the sandwich specimens were sectioned in rectangular microspecimens and trimmed at the interface to a dumbbell shape (1.1-mm diameter). One half of the specimens was subjected to a microtensile bond strength (μTBS) test, and the other half was tested after six months of water storage (aging). Data were statistically analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model for the factors surface treatment, material type, and aging, together with their first-degree interactions (α=0.05). RESULTS: The lowest bond strengths were obtained in the absence of any surface treatment (group 1), while the highest μTBSs were obtained when the surface was roughened by either SB or HF, this in combination with chemical adhesion through Si. Loss in bond strength was observed after six-month aging when either surface roughening or silanization, or both, were omitted. CONCLUSIONS: Both the composite and polymer-infiltrated ceramic CAD/CAM blocks appeared equally bonding-receptive regardless of the surface treatment used. Creating a microretentive surface by either SB or HF, followed by chemical adhesion using Si, is mandatory to maintain the bond strength after six months.",2017,1,1,
485, The effect of a fiber reinforced cavity configuration on load bearing capacity and failure mode of endodontically treated molars restored with CAD/CAM resin composite overlay restorations,"G. T. Rocca, C. M. Saratti, M. Cattani-Lorente, A. J. Feilzer, S. Scherrer and I. Krejci", J Dent," OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the fracture strength and the mode of failure of endodontically treated molars restored with CAD/CAM overlays with fiber reinforced composite build-up of the pulp chamber. METHODS: 40 Devitalized molars were cut over the CEJ and divided into five groups (n=8). The pulp chamber area was filled with: group 0 (control), no resin build-up; group 1, hybrid composite build-up (G-aenial posterior, GC); group 2, as in group 1 but covered with 3 nets of bi-directional E-glass fibers (EverStickNET, Stick Tech Ltd.); group 3, a FRC resin (EverX posterior, GC); group 4, as in group 3 but covered by the bi-directional fibers. The crowns were restored with CAD-CAM composite restorations (Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE). Maximum fracture loads were recorded in Newton and data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test (p<0.05). Fragments were analyzed using SEM. RESULTS: The mean static loads in Newton were: group 0: 2448 (546); group 1: 2817 (873); group 2: 2128 (952); group 3: 2429 (1091); group 4: 2577 (833). No significant differences were found between the groups (p>0.05). All specimens fractured in a catastrophic way, under the CEJ. The main crack evolved in the corono-apical direction. In groups 2 and 4 secondary fracture paths with apico-coronal direction were detected close to the bi-directional fibers' layer. CONCLUSIONS: For the restoration of endodontically treated molars, the incorporation of FRCs did not influence the load-bearing capacity of the tooth-restoration complex. The SEM analysis showed a low ability of the bi-directional fibers net in deviating the fracture but this effect was not sufficient to lead more favorable fracture patterns, over the CEJ. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of FRCs to reinforce the ""core"" of devitalized molars against vertical fractures under static loads seems useless when the thickness of the CAD/CAM composite overlay restoration is high.",2015,0,1,
309, Influence of no-ferrule and no-post buildup design on the fatigue resistance of endodontically treated molars restored with resin nanoceramic CAD/CAM crowns,"P. Magne, A. O. Carvalho, G. Bruzi, R. E. Anderson, H. P. Maia and M. Giannini", Oper Dent," OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of adhesive core buildup designs-4-mm buildup, 2-mm buildup, and no buildup (endocrown)-on the fatigue resistance and failure mode of endodontically treated molar teeth restored with resin nanoceramic (RNC) CAD/CAM complete crowns placed with self-adhesive resin cement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-five extracted molars were decoronated at the level of the cementoenamel junction, and the roots were endodontically treated. Specimens received different Filtek Z100 adhesive core buildups (4-mm buildup, 2-mm buildup, and no buildup, endocrown preparation) and were restored with Cerec 3 CAD/CAM RNC crowns (Lava Ultimate). Restorations (n=15) and prepared teeth were treated with airborne-particle abrasion, followed by cementation with RelyX Unicem 2 Automix. Specimens were then subjected to cyclic isometric loading at 10 Hz, beginning with a load of 200 N (for 5000 cycles), followed by stages of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 N at a maximum of 30,000 cycles each. Specimens were loaded until failure or to a maximum of 185,000 cycles (10-mm-diameter composite resin sphere antagonist). The failure mode was assessed: ""catastrophic"" (tooth/root fracture that would require tooth extraction), ""possibly reparable"" (cohesive/adhesive failure with fragment and minor damage, chip or crack, of underlying tooth structure), or ""reparable"" fracture (cohesive or cohesive/adhesive fracture of restoration only). Groups were compared using the life table survival analysis. Intact specimens were loaded to failure and compared with one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: All specimens survived the fatigue test until the 800 N-step. The survival rates for 4-mm, 2-mm, and no buildup (endocrown) were 53%, 87%, and 87%, respectively, and were not statistically different even though crowns with 2-mm buildups only started to fail at 1200 N. Minor cohesive chips were detected in many samples despite having survived all 185,000 cycles. Postfatigue load-to-failure ranged from 2969 N with 4-mm buildup (eight specimens), 2794 N for 2-mm buildup (13 specimens), and 2606 N for endocrowns (13 specimens) and were also not statistically different. There were only two catastrophic failures during the fatigue test and small subgingival delamination fractures and cracks (only with 4-mm buildup). All specimens in the load-to-failure test exhibited nonrestorable catastrophic fractures. CONCLUSIONS: There was no influence of the buildup design on the performance of endodontically treated molars restored with RNC CAD/CAM complete crowns placed with self-adhesive cement. All restoration designs survived the normal range of masticatory forces. Failure mode tended to be more favorable with the 2-mm buildup or no buildup (endocrown).",2014,1,0,
416, Probability of survival of implant-supported metal ceramic and CAD/CAM resin nanoceramic crowns,"E. A. Bonfante, M. Suzuki, F. C. Lorenzoni, L. A. Sena, R. Hirata, G. Bonfante and P. G. Coelho", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the probability of survival and failure modes of implant-supported resin nanoceramic relative to metal-ceramic crowns. METHODS: Resin nanoceramic molar crowns (LU) (Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE, USA) were milled and metal-ceramic (MC) (Co-Cr alloy, Wirobond C+, Bego, USA) with identical anatomy were fabricated (n=21). The metal coping and a burnout-resin veneer were created by CAD/CAM, using an abutment (Stealth-abutment, Bicon LLC, USA) and a milled crown from the LU group as models for porcelain hot-pressing (GC-Initial IQ-Press, GC, USA). Crowns were cemented, the implants (n=42, Bicon) embedded in acrylic-resin for mechanical testing, and subjected to single-load to fracture (SLF, n=3 each) for determination of step-stress profiles for accelerated-life testing in water (n=18 each). Weibull curves (50,000 cycles at 200N, 90% CI) were plotted. Weibull modulus (m) and characteristic strength (η) were calculated and a contour plot used (m versus η) for determining differences between groups. Fractography was performed in SEM and polarized-light microscopy. RESULTS: SLF mean values were 1871N (±54.03) for MC and 1748N (±50.71) for LU. Beta values were 0.11 for MC and 0.49 for LU. Weibull modulus was 9.56 and η=1038.8N for LU, and m=4.57 and η=945.42N for MC (p>0.10). Probability of survival (50,000 and 100,000 cycles at 200 and 300N) was 100% for LU and 99% for MC. Failures were cohesive within LU. In MC crowns, porcelain veneer fractures frequently extended to the supporting metal coping. CONCLUSION: Probability of survival was not different between crown materials, but failure modes differed. SIGNIFICANCE: In load bearing regions, similar reliability should be expected for metal ceramics, known as the gold standard, and resin nanoceramic crowns over implants. Failure modes involving porcelain veneer fracture and delamination in MC crowns are less likely to be successfully repaired compared to cohesive failures in resin nanoceramic material.",2015,1,0,

Reis", Dent Mater," OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the probability of survival and failure modes of lithium-disilicate, feldspathic-ceramic, and resin-nanoceramic anterior veneers cemented on dentin analog substrates after sliding-contact step-stress accelerated life testing (SSALT). METHODS: A virtual incisor tooth preparation was produced with a reduction of 1.5mm at the incisal edge and of 0.7mm buccally. A .STL file of the preparation was generated and CAD/CAM based G10 dentin-analog material was used for testing. Laminate veneers were milled in three different materials: lithium-disilicate (LDS, E.max CAD), resin-nanoceramic (RN, Lava Ultimate), and feldspathic-ceramic (FELDS, Vita Blocks). SSALT was employed where a spherical indenter contacted the veneer, slided along its interface with G10 to lift off and start a new cycle at 2Hz in water. Qualitative fractography was performed. The probability of survival (90% confidence-bounds) was calculated for several load/cycle missions. RESULTS: The probability of survival for a mission of 50,000 cycles decreased from 50 up to 150N equally for all groups and were not different between them. At 200N, the probability of survival was significantly lower for FELDS (10%) compared to RN veneers (41%), whereas LDS presented intermediate values (22%). The characteristic strength of RN (247N) was significantly higher than LDS (149N), and FELDS (151N). In FELDS and LDS, hackles, wake hackles and twist hackles indicated the direction of crack propagation. In RN, hackles were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in probability of survival were observed only at 180 and 200N between groups. Failure modes were similar with veneer fracture down to the tooth-analog substrate.",2020,1,0,
177, Effect of UV aging on translucency of currently used esthetic CAD-CAM materials,"S. Turgut, H. Kılınç and B. Bağış", J Esthet Restor Dent, OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relative translucency parameter (RTP) values of computer-aided design (CAD)-computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) materials after UV aging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 70 specimens (n = 10) of Bruxzir Anterior (BA); E.max Cad (EC); Lava Ultimate (LU); Cerasmart (CE); Vita Enamic (VE); Vita Suprinity (VS); Vita Mark II (VM) were prepared (1 mm ± 0.01 mm). Color measurements were performed using a spectrofotometer (VITA Easyshade). RTP values of the specimens before (RTP(1) ) and after UV aging (RTP(2) ) were evaluated. Statistical analyses were done with repeated measurements of two-way-ANOVA with Bonferroni test (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Evaluating RTP(1) and RTP(2) values; significant differences were found (P < 0.05). There were no significant difference between the RTP(1) values of CE and VS (P = 0.779); EC and VM (P = 0.952); VM and LU (P = 0.995); EP and LU (P = 0.653). Evaluating RTP(2) values; VE and BA were found significantly different from the others (P < 0.05). For all evaluated groups TP values decreased after UV aging (P < 0.05). The most RTP reduction was observed for LU; while VM and EC were less affected. CONCLUSION: Glass ceramic VE showed the highest RTP and zirconia-based BA was the most opaque restorative CAD-CAM material. UV aging caused the CAD-CAM materials get more opaque. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In cases where translucency is needed chosing VE would give better esthetic results; while zirconia-based BA should be used if more opaque restoration is needed. Clinicians should be aware of that restorations get more opaque after usage.,2019,0,0,
207, Evaluation of the marginal fit of three margin designs of resin composite crowns using CAD/CAM,"E. A. Tsitrou, S. E. Northeast and R. van Noort", J Dent," OBJECTIVES: To examine the marginal fit of resin composite crowns manufactured with the CEREC 3 system employing three different margin designs; bevel, chamfer and shoulder, by means of a replica technique and a luting agent. METHODS: Three master casts were fabricated from an impression of a typodont molar tooth and a full-coverage crown prepared with a marginal finish of a bevel, a chamfer and a shoulder. Each cast was replicated 10 times (n=10). Scanning of the replicas and crown designing was performed using the CEREC Scan system. The crowns were milled from Paradigm MZ100 composite resin blocks. The marginal fit of the crowns was evaluated with a replica technique (Aquasil LV, Dentsply), and with a resin composite cement (RelyX Unicem, Aplicap) and measured with a travelling microscope. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: For the replica technique the average marginal gaps recorded were: Bevel Group 105+/-34 microm, Chamfer Group 94+/-27 microm and Shoulder Group 91+/-22 microm. For the resin composite cement the average marginal gaps were: Bevel Group 102+/-28 microm, Chamfer Group 91+/-11 microm and Shoulder Group 77+/-8 microm. Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the three groups of finishing lines regardless of the cementation technique used. CONCLUSIONS: The marginal gap of resin composite crowns manufactured with the CEREC 3 system is within the range of clinical acceptance, regardless of the finishing line prepared or the cementation technique used.",2007,0,1,

K. J. Mainjot and C. Charavet, J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVES: To introduce a minimally invasive and simple ortho-pros approach for localized tooth wear treatment. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Four patients with localized anterior and/or posterior tooth wear were treated. Occlusal analyses were performed, and localized wax-up or digital setup were designed based on estimated tissue loss. No-prep anterior and posterior partial-coverage polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN, Vita Enamic) restorations (eg, palatal and occlusal veneers) were computer-aided designed and manufactured (CAD-CAM), tried in, and bonded in supraocclusion, creating a posterior open bite. Then, brief partial (three patients) or global (one patient, for anterior teeth alignment request) orthodontic treatment was performed to extrude the posterior teeth and re-establish posterior occlusal contacts. The orthodontic treatment duration was ~2 months for extrusion. Direct composites were performed to mask the labial finish line of palatal veneers. Clinical results were successful after a follow-up of 15, 21, 23, and 47 months, with 100% success rate of PICN anterior restorations and some minor chippings of borders of thin (0.2 mm) posterior occlusal veneers. Patient-reported outcomes were positive. CONCLUSION: Orthodontic-assisted one step-no prep technique is an advantageous and straightforward evolution of the Dahl concept. PICNs exhibit several advantages in this interdisciplinary approach. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: New hybrid-ceramic CAD-CAM materials and a collaborative interdisciplinary approach support the evolution of the Dahl concept for conservative treatment of worn dentitions. The orthodontic-assisted one step-no prep technique is predictable, efficient, and well tolerated by patients and conserves tooth structure.",2020,1,0,

Mainjot, J Esthet Restor Dent," OBJECTIVES: To introduce a novel approach for full-mouth rehabilitation of severely worn dentition using polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) computer-aided-design and manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorations, without tooth tissue preparation and provisional phase. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Three patients with generalized tooth wear, suffering from dental pain, masticatory dysfunction, bruxism and neck and back pain, were selected and treated in collaboration with physiotherapists. Occlusal analyses were performed and full-mouth diagnostic wax-ups were designed on the basis of estimated tissue loss. Deficient direct restorations were replaced and low-thickness PICN (Vita Enamic) restorations (up to 0.2 mm) were CAD-CAM designed from wax-ups, milled, tried-in and then bonded within two consecutive days. To mask palatal veneers, either buccal direct composites or glass-ceramic veneers were later performed. An occlusal splint was realized. Clinical results were shown to be successful after a follow-up of 22, 18, and 13 months, respectively. The absence of provisional phase did not engender any inconveniences. Patient reported outcomes were very positive, showing a reduction in neck and back pain and a well-being increase. CONCLUSION: The proposed protocol is particularly minimally invasive and straightforward compared to classical techniques. PICNs exhibit several advantages compared to other materials. Preliminary results of this multidisciplinary approach are promising but deserve further clinical research. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The development of CAD-CAM technologies offers the possibility of improving treatment of severe worn dentition, reducing chairtime and need of tooth tissue preparation, and introducing a new class of composite materials (hybrid ceramics), which exhibit interesting properties for this indication. The influence of the proposed multidisciplinary approach, particularly the collaboration with physiotherapists, needs to be further explored with respect to treatment of associated symptoms, such as masticatory muscles hypertrophy and neck pain.",2020,1,0,
311," Influence of preparation, fitting, and cementation on the vitro performance and fracture resistance of CAD/CAM crowns","M. Rosentritt, V. Preis, M. Behr and S. Hahnel", J Dent," OBJECTIVES: To investigate debonding and stability of CAD/CAM composite crowns as a function of (a) preparation design, (b) fitting parameters of the milling process, and (c) type of cementation. METHODS: Extracted human molars were prepared providing either retentive design (R) or no retention (NR). After digitalization, full-contour crowns were milled using either optimal (OF) or reduced (RF) fitting parameters. A total of 112 crowns were milled from the composite materials Lava Ultimate (L) and Grandio Blocs (G) and a ceramic reference. The crowns were either cemented with self-adhesive cement (SE) or were adhesively bonded (A). After water storage, thermal cycling and mechanical loading was performed. Restorations which failed during storage or TCML were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and surviving restorations were loaded to fracture. RESULTS: L crowns survived only with R/OF/A conditions. No debondings were observed for G crowns with OF/A conditions as well as R/OF/SE conditions. Surviving L crowns showed mean fracture values of 1227N (NR/RF/A) and 1534N (R/OF/A), and for surviving G crowns mean fracture values of 2021N (R/OF), 1872N (R/RF), 2242N (NR/OF), and 2070N (NR/RF) were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Retentive preparation design and/or optimal fitting reduced the number of debondings. For composite restorations, adhesive cementation should be preferred. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Preparation design, fitting parameters as well as the type of cementation impact the performance of composite crowns. Retentive preparation design and/or good fitting are mandatory to avoid debonding of composite restorations; adhesive cementation should be preferred in any case.",2017,0,1,
371, Microleakage of composite crowns luted on CAD/CAM-milled human molars: a new method for standardized in vitro tests,"M. A. Schlenz, A. Schmidt, P. Rehmann, T. Niem and B. Wöstmann", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: To investigate debonding of full crowns made of CAD/CAM composites, CAD/CAM technology was applied to manufacture standardized test abutments to increase the reproducibility of human teeth used in in vitro studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A virtual test abutment and the corresponding virtual crown were designed and two STL data sets were generated. Sixty-four human third molars and CAD/CAM blocks were milled using a CNC machine. Crowns of four different composite blocks (Lava Ultimate (LU), Brilliant Crios (BC), Cerasmart (CS), Experimental (EX)) were adhesively bonded with their corresponding luting system (LU: Scotchbond Universal/RelyX Ultimate; BC: One Coat 7 Universal/DuoCem; CS: G-PremioBond/G-Cem LinkForce; EX: Experimental-Bond/Experimental-Luting-Cement). Half of the specimens were chemical-cured (CC) and the others were light-cured (LC). Afterwards, specimens were artificially aged in a chewing simulator (WL-tec, 1 million cycles, 50-500 N, 2 Hz, 37 °C). Finally, a dye penetration test was used to detect debonding. For inspection, the specimens were sliced, and penetration depth was measured with a digital microscope. Data were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: No cases of total debonding were observed after cyclic loading. However, the LC specimens showed a significantly lower amount of leakage than the CC ones (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the CC specimens exhibited broad scattering. Only the LC-EX blocks showed no debonding. The CC-CS blocks showed the highest leakage and scattering of all tested specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Natural human teeth can be manufactured by CAD/CAM technology in highly standardized test abutments for in vitro testing. For CAD/CAM composites, light curing should be performed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The success of a restoration depends on the long-term sealing ability of the luting materials, which avoids debonding along with microleakage. For CAD/CAM composites, separate light curing of the adhesive and luting composite is highly recommended.",2019,0,1,
394," Nine prophylactic polishing pastes: impact on discoloration, gloss, and surface properties of a CAD/CAM resin composite","A. Liebermann, S. Spintzyk, M. Reymus, E. Schweizer and B. Stawarczyk", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: To investigate discoloration reduction and changes of surface properties of a CAD/CAM resin composite after 14 days´ storage in red wine and polishing with nine different prophylactic polishing pastes (PPPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rectangular discs (N = 172) were fabricated and polished (P4000) using GC Cerasmart (GC Europe) to investigate different polishing protocols with 1-4 related descending PPPs (22 in total): Cleanic/CLE-Kerr, CleanJoy/CLJ-Voco, Clean Polish/Super Polish/SPO-Kerr, Clinpro Prophy Paste/CPP-3M, Détartrine/DET-Septodont, Nupro/NUP-Dentsply Sirona, Prophy Paste CCS/CCS-Directa, Proxyt/PXT-Ivoclar Vivadent, and Zircate/ZIR Prophy Paste-Dentsply Sirona. Surface properties (roughness values (RV)/Ra, Rz, Rv, surface free energy (SFE), surface gloss (G), and discoloration (ΔE)) were analyzed before and after storage and additional polishing. Data were examined using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, three-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-B post hoc, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis H tests (α < 0.05). RESULTS: Regarding RV, CLE, followed by CCS, and CPP showed the highest values; the lowest presented SPO and DET (p < 0.001). No impact of PPP was observed on ΔE values (p = 0.160). The lowest SFE presented DET, followed by SPO; highest showed CCS followed by NUP and CPP (p < 0.001). Within G, lowest values were observed for CLE and NUP, followed by CCS, ZIP, and CLJ (p < 0.001); the highest presented SPO (p < 0.001). Polishing showed generally a positive impact on SFE values (p < 0.001-p = 0.007), except ZIP (p = 0.322) and CLE (p = 0.083). G increased and RV decreased after polishing (p < 0.001), except SPO, with no significant change for G (p = 0.786). CONCLUSIONS: Polishing with PPPs improves the surface properties and is generally recommended. The choice of PPP has a minor role in removing discolorations. Multi-step systems should be carried out conscientiously. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The proper selection of PPP is essential for the clinical outcome of surface properties of prosthetic restorations. Not every polishing paste leads to the same final surface quality.",2019,0,1,
111, Edge strength of CAD/CAM materials,"M. Pfeilschifter, V. Preis, M. Behr and M. Rosentritt", J Dent," OBJECTIVES: To investigate the edge force of CAD/CAM materials as a function of (a) material, (b) thickness, and (c) distance from the margin. METHODS: Materials intended for processing with CAD/CAM were investigated: eight resin composites, one resin-infiltrated ceramic, and a clinically proven lithiumdisilicate ceramic (reference). To measure edge force (that is, load to failure/crack), plates (d = 1 mm) were fixed and loaded with a Vickers diamond indenter (1 mm/min, Zwick 1446) at a distance of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 mm from the edge. Edge force was defined as a loading force at a distance of 0.5 mm. The type of failure was determined. To investigate the influence of the thickness, all data were determined on 1-mm and 2-mm plates. To test the influence of bonding and an underlying dentin, individual 1-mm plates were bonded to a 1-mm-thick dentin-like (concerning modulus of elasticity) resin composite. RESULTS: For the 1-mm plates, edge force varied between 64.4 ± 24.2 N (Shofu Block HC) and 183.2 ± 63.3 N (ceramic reference), with significant (p ≤ 0.001) differences between the materials. For the 2-mm plates, values between 129.2 ± 32.5 N (Lava Ultimate) and 230.3 ± 67.5 N (Cerasmart) were found. Statistical comparison revealed no significant differences (p > 0.109) between the materials. Brilliant Crios (p = 0.023), Enamic (p = 0.000), Shofu Blocks HC (p = 0.009), and Grandio Bloc (p = 0.002) showed significantly different edge force between the 1-mm- and 2-mm-thick plates. The failure pattern was either cracking, (severe) chipping, or fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Material, material thickness, and distance from the edge impact the edge force of CAD/CAM materials. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: CAD/CAM materials should be carefully selected on the basis of their individual edge force and performance during milling.",2018,1,1,
411, Polishing effects and wear performance of chairside CAD/CAM materials,"M. Matzinger, S. Hahnel, V. Preis and M. Rosentritt", Clin Oral Investig," OBJECTIVES: To investigate the surface roughness of CAD/CAM materials immediately after milling and after different chairside and labside polishing procedures. A two-body wear test was performed to compare the different wear characteristics of the materials and the corresponding antagonists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens (n = 12 per series) from different CAD/CAM materials (three composites: Lava Ultimate, Cerasmart, BRILLIANT Crios; one hybrid ceramic: VITA Enamic; three ceramics: Celtra Duo, VITA Suprinity, IPS Emax.CAD) were polished according to the manufacturer's instructions. The effect of different polishing procedures was investigated by comparing surface roughness (R(a), R(max)) after labside polishing and after chairside polishing. Wear behavior (mean, volume, and maximum wear) of specimens and antagonists as well as changes in surface roughness were determined in a pin-on-block wear test. Statistical analysis was performed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)/Bonferroni multiple-comparison post hoc test and a multifactorial ANOVA/Tukey's significant difference post hoc test (α = 0.05). SEM micrographs were used for the qualitative evaluation of surfaces and wear traces. RESULTS: After chairside high-gloss polishing, ceramics and composites exhibited R(a) values between 0.08 and 0.10 μm and between 0.11 and 0.13 μm, respectively. After labside high-gloss polishing, values varied between 0.02 and 0.09 μm for ceramics and between 0.06 and 0.16 μm for resin composites. No significant differences were found between labside and chairside pre- and high-gloss polishing. For the ceramics, lower mean wear depths (between - 132.2 ± 19.9 and - 137.0 ± 19.0 μm) were identified compared to the resin composites (which exhibited wear depths between - 159.1 ± 19.4 and - 176.3 ± 23.9 μm). For maximum wear depth and volume, a different ranking of the materials was found. Antagonistic wear varied between 12.0 ± 6.4% and 30.6 ± 9.9% and was higher for the ceramic materials and Lava Ultimate. For all materials, a smoothing between 0.20 and 2.70 μm (R(a)) was identified after wear simulation. CONCLUSIONS: Chairside polishing is as effective as labside polishing, although surfaces were directly adjusted (roughened) only before the chairside polishing. Wear was lowest for ceramics, followed by the resin-infiltrated material and the resin composites. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Polishing after milling or adjustment is essential to guaranteeing optimal clinical performance. Chairside polishing after adjustment leads to comparably smooth surfaces as labside polishing after milling and grinding. Ceramics are expected to exhibit lower wear than resin composites under clinical conditions.",2019,1,1,
512, The one-step no-prep approach for full-mouth rehabilitation of worn dentition using PICN CAD-CAM restorations: 2-yr results of a prospective clinical study,"J. Oudkerk, M. Eldafrawy, S. Bekaert, C. Grenade, A. Vanheusden and A. Mainjot", J Dent," OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the One-step No-prep treatment of full mouth-worn dentition, a minimally invasive and multidisciplinary approach using PICN CAD-CAM composite restorations without provisional phase. METHODS: Seven patients (n = 192 restorations) with severe tooth wear were included. Patient data were recorded, and an occlusal analysis and a tissue-guided wax-up were realized. After replacement of old fillings, no-prep Vita Enamic restorations (posterior restorations and palatal veneers) were bonded within 24 h. Direct composites were performed to mask the buccal joint on anterior teeth. Maxillo-facial physiotherapy was performed. Restorations were evaluated following World Dental Federation criteria. Treatment influence on Oral-Health-Impact-Profile-49 (OHIP-49) score was assessed. RESULTS: Tooth wear etiology was related to soft drink consumption and bruxism. Mean VDO increase was 5.09 ± 0.85 mm on the incisal pin. The mean restoration thickness on molars was 0.55 ± 0.21 mm, and the lowest was 0.11 mm. 2-year survival rate of restorations was 100 % and success rate was 93.5 %, with 11 minor chippings and one debonding. A significant improvement of the global OHIP-49 score was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In this clinical study on high risk patients, PICN restorations, applied in a minimally invasive way, showed high survival and success rates after two years, while minor chipping of very thin occlusal borders constituted the most frequent complication. Moreover, the patient acceptance was good according to OHIP-49 in this multidisciplinary approach. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of PICNs allows the development of no prep and simple treatment protocols of worn dentition. The absence of provisionals did not engender any problem, on the basis of the realization of an occlusal analysis, the support of a maxillo-facial physiotherapist, and the use of an easy-to-adjust restorative material.",2020,1,1,
339, Load-bearing capacities of ultra-thin occlusal veneers bonded to dentin,"M. Maeder, P. Pasic, A. Ender, M. Özcan, G. I. Benic and A. Ioannidis", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," OBJECTIVES: To test whether the load-bearing capacity of occlusal veneers made of ceramic or hybrid materials bonded to dentin does differ from those of porcelain-fused-to metal or lithium disilicate glass ceramic crowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 80 human molars, occlusal tooth substance was removed so that the defects extended into dentin, simulating defects caused by attrition/erosion. Restorations at a standardized thickness of either 0.5 mm or 1.0 mm were digitally designed. For both thicknesses, 4 test groups (n = 10 per group) were defined, each including a different restorative material: ""0.5-ZIR"": 0.5 mm thick zirconia (Vita YZ HT); ""1.0-ZIR"": 1.0 mm thick zirconia (Vita YZ HT); ""0.5-LDC"": 0.5 mm thick lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press); ""1.0-LDC"": 1.0 mm thick lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press); ""0.5-HYC"": 0.5 mm thick PICN (Vita Enamic); ""1.0-HYC"": 1.0 mm thick PICN (Vita Enamic); ""0.5-COC"": 0.5 mm thick tooth shaded resin composite (Lava Ultimate) and ""1.0-COC"": 1.0 mm thick tooth shaded resin composite (Lava Ultimate). Consecutively, the specimens were thermo-mechanically aged and then loaded until fracture. The load-bearing capacities (F(max)) between the groups were statistically compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) and pairwise group comparison applying the Dunn's method. In addition, the results were compared to those of conventional lithium-disilicate ceramic crowns (""CLD"") and to porcelain-fused to metal crowns (""PFM""). RESULTS: The median F(initial) values for the 0.5 mm thin restorations were 1'350 N for 0.5-ZIR, 850 N for 0.5-LDC, 1'100 N for 0.5-HYC and 1'950 N for 0.5-COC. With CLD as the control, a significant difference was found between the groups 0.5-COC and 0.5-LDC (KW: p = 0.0124). With PFM as the control, the comparisons between PFM and 0.5-LDC as well as between 0.5-COC and 0.5-LDC were significant (KW: p = 0.0026). Median F(max) values of 2'493 N in the group 0.5-ZIR, 1'165 in the group 0.5-LDC, 2'275 N in the group 0.5-HYC and 2'265 N in the group 0.5-COC were found. The medians of the F(initial) values for the 1.0 thick restorations amounted of 2'100 N in 1.0-ZIR, 1'750 N in 1.0-LDC, 2'000 N in 1.0-HYC and 2'300 N in 1.0-COC. Testing the multiple comparisons with Dunn's method no significant differences were found (p > 0.05). The median F(max) values of the 1.0 mm thick restorations were: 2'489 N in the group 1.0-ZIR, 1'864 N in the group 1.0-LDC, 2'485 N in the group 1.0-HYC and 2'479 N in the group 1.0-COC. With CLD as the control group, a significant difference between zirconia and lithium-disilicate was found for the 0.5 (p = 0.0017) and 1.0 mm (p = 0.0320) thick specimens. Comparing the 0.5 mm thick specimens with CLD as the control, a significant difference was found between 0.5-HYC and 0.5-LDC (p = 0.0017). With PFM as the control, the comparison of lithium disilicate and zirconia was statistically significant for both thicknesses (p = 0.0009 for the 0.5 mm thick specimens; p = 0.0074 for the 1.0 mm thick specimens). In addition, with PFM as control group, significant differences were seen between 0.5-LDC and all other groups with restorations in 0.5 mm thickness (p = 0.0017). CONCLUSIONS: Regarding their maximum load-bearing capacity, minimally invasive occlusal veneers made of ceramic, hybrid materials or polymeric materials can be applied to correct occlusal tooth wear with exposed dentin and thus replace conventional crown restorations in cases of normally expected intraoral bite forces.",2019,1,1,
514, Three-Dimensional Digital Evaluation of the Fit of Endocrowns Fabricated from Different CAD/CAM Materials,"M. Zimmermann, A. Valcanaia, G. Neiva, A. Mehl and D. Fasbinder", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: A wide variety of CAD/CAM materials are available for single-tooth restorations. CAD/CAM material characteristics are different and may influence CAM fabrication accuracy. There is no study investigating the influence of different CAD/CAM materials on the final fit of the restoration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fit of endocrowns fabricated from different CAD/CAM materials using a new 3D evaluation method with an intraoral scanning system. The null hypothesis was that there are no significant differences for the fitting accuracy of different CAD/CAM materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preparation for an endocrown was performed on a maxillary right first molar on a typodont, and restorations were fabricated with a chairside CAD/CAM system (CEREC Omnicam, MCXL). Three groups using three different CAD/CAM materials were established (each n = 10): zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic (Celtra Duo; CD), leucite-reinforced silicate ceramic (Empress CAD; EM), resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate; LU). A 3D digital measurement technique (OraCheck, Cyfex AG) using an intraoral scanner (CEREC Omnicam) was used to measure the difference in fit between the three materials for a master endocrown preparation. The preparation scan and the endocrown fit scan were matched with special difference analysis software OraCheck. Three areas were selected for fitting accuracy measurements: margin (MA), axial (AX), occlusal (OC). Statistical analysis was performed using 80% percentile, one-way ANOVA, and post-hoc Scheffé test. Significance level was set to p = 0.05. RESULTS: Results varied from best 88.9 ± 7.7 μm for marginal fit of resin nanoceramic restorations (LU_MA) to worst 182.3 ± 24.0 μm for occlusal fit of zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate restorations (CD_OC). Statistically significant differences were found both within and among the test groups. Group CD performed statistically significantly different from group LU for marginal fit (MA) and axial fit (AX) (p < 0.05). For occlusal fit (OC), no statistically significant differences were found within all three test groups (p > 0.05). Deviation pattern for differences was visually analyzed with a color-coded scheme for each restoration. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant differences were found for different CAD/CAM materials if the CAM procedure was identical. Within the limitations of this study, the choice of CAD/CAM material may influence the fitting accuracy of CAD/CAM-fabricated restorations.",2019,1,0,
188, Effects of staining liquids and finishing methods on translucency of a hybrid ceramic material having two different translucency levels,"S. U. Buyukkaplan, M. M. Özarslan, Ç. Barutcigil, M. Arslan, K. Barutcigil and E. E. Yoldan", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: Beverages may affect the translucency of esthetic dental restorative materials. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of coffee and red wine on the translucency of a PICN material with two translucency levels, and finished with different methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 2M2 high translucent and translucent VITA Enamic hybrid ceramic blocks were investigated. Rectangular specimens with the dimensions of 12 mm × 14 mm × 2 mm were prepared. The specimens were finished and polished with different methods as suggested by the manufacturer. The translucency parameters of the specimens were evaluated before and after 24 hours, 7 days, and 28 days immersion in distilled water, coffee and red wine. Translucency parameters were measured using a portable spectrophotometer. RESULTS: At the end of 28 days, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups of specimens kept in coffee (P>.05). In the red wine groups, there was a statistically significant difference between the control group and all other groups (P<.05) at the end of 28 days. CONCLUSION: The translucency of hybrid ceramic for a restoration may not be important regarding the effects of coffee on translucency change because the specimens with different translucencies and finishing methods that were immersed to coffee had similar translucency parameters at the end of 28 days. The translucency of hybrid ceramic may be important in the case of red wine, however, since the results showed that highly translucent specimens exposed to red wine demonstrated better translucency parameters than specimens made from translucent blocks at the end of 28 days.",2017,1,0,
229, Flexural resistance of CAD-CAM blocks. Part 3: Polymer-based restorative materials for permanent restorations,"A. Vichi, C. Goracci, M. Carrabba, G. Tozzi and C. Louca", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: Concurrently with the growing interest in CAD-CAM systems, several new materials of different chemical nature have become available. As an alternative to ceramics, numerous polymer-based materials have recently been proposed for permanent prosthetic restorations. Aim of this study was to test the CAD-CAM polymer-based materials available on the market, comparing mean flexural strength, Weibull characteristic strength and Weibull modulus. METHODS: Seven types of polymer-based blocks were tested: Lava Ultimate, 3M; Brilliant Crios, Coltene; Cerasmart, GC; Block HC, Shofu; Katana Avencia, Noritake; Grandio Blocs, Voco; Tetric CAD, and Ivoclar-Vivadent. Specimens were cut out from blocks, finished, polished, and tested in a three-point bending test apparatus until failure (n=30). Flexural strength, Weibull characteristic strength, and Weibull modulus were calculated. Flexural strength data were statistically analyzed. ANOVA on Ranks was applied, followed by the Dunn's test for post hoc comparisons (P= 0.05). RESULTS: Flexural strength values (MPa) were measured (mean±standard deviation). Different letters in parentheses label statistically significant differences: Grandio Blocs 266±24(a), Brilliant Crios 259±21(ab); Tetric CAD 254±15(ab); Katana Avencia 241±29(bc); Cerasmart 221±24(cd); Lava Ultimate 196±23(de); Block HC 139±10(e). All the tested materials had flexural strengths greater than 100 MPa, thereby satisfying the requirements of ISO standards for polymer-based materials. For all the tested materials the Weibull characteristic strength was greater than 100 MPa. Weibull modulus ranged between 21.20 (Tetric CAD) and 9.09 (Katana Avencia). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Even though all the CAD-CAM polymer-based materials marketed in blocks tested in the present study satisfy the requirements of ISO standard for polymer-based materials, their flexural resistance differs significantly. The data presented in the study may be helpful to clinicians for selecting the most appropriate materials for each clinical case.",2020,0,0,

239, Fracture origin and crack propagation of CAD/CAM composite crowns by combining of in vitro and in silico approaches,"S. Yamaguchi, Y. Katsumoto, K. Hayashi, M. Aoki, M. Kunikata, Y. Nakase, C. Lee and S. Imazato", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," PURPOSE: Fractographic analysis has been used to investigate the fracture behavior of Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) composite crowns by subjecting them to compression tests. However, it is difficult to investigate details of the fracture, including its initiation and propagation, using in vitro tests. The aim of this study was to determine the fracture origins and the order of crack initiation of CAD/CAM composite crowns using in silico nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis (FEA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The following materials were used: Cerasmart (CS), Katana Avencia Block (KA), and Shofu Block HC (HC) as CAD/CAM crowns, Panavia SA Cement Plus (SA) as a luting material, and Clearfil DC Core Plus (DC) as an abutment. The elastic moduli and fracture strain of each material were obtained from the stress-strain curve of in vitro three-point bending tests. The fracture origins and order of crack initiation of the materials were determined by in silico nonlinear dynamic compression analysis. Load-displacement curves were statistically compared with the results of the in vitro compression tests (Pearson's correlation test, α = 0.05). RESULTS: The nonlinear dynamic FEA demonstrated that crack initiation was primarily observed near the lingual side of the CAD/CAM crowns and immediately propagated to the central fossa. The models were fractured following the in vitro fracture strains, showing the same order for the products tested (CS/KA/HC, SA, and DC). Load-displacement curves with the use of CS, KA, and HC were significantly correlated to the corresponding in vitro compression tests results (CS: r = 0.985, p < 0.05, KA: r = 0.987, p < 0.05, and HC: r = 0.997, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The in silico model established in this study clarified the crack initiation of the CAD/CAM composite crowns and the order of crack initiation among the investigated products, suggesting that the present approach is useful for analyzing the fracture behavior of CAD/CAM composite crowns in detail.",2020,0,1,

METHODS: Four commercial CAD/CAM resin composite blanks were tested: Shofu block HC 2 layer, Cerasmart, Katana Avencia block, and KZR-CAD HR Block 2. The specimens in the size of 10.0×12.0×2.0mm were immersed in a 50-mL conical tube containing 40mL of purified water, and then placed in a constant-temperature oven set at a temperature of 37, 60, 70, or 80°C and stored statically for 30 days. After storage, the concentrations of leached elements in the immersion solution were measured with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. To characterize the surface of the specimen after the immersion test, secondary electron images were obtained. RESULTS: The immersion test resulted in the leaching of Si, the main component, from all materials tested. Some materials were found to have leached high amount of Ba or Sr in addition to Si, and remarkable surface degradation was observed. The amount of leached elements increased with increased immersion temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Filler elements in CAD/CAM composite resins used in this study leached into purified water. The leached elements and its quantities greatly differed among materials and depend on the types of the oxides composing the filler. The amounts of leached elements varied in a temperature-dependent manner.",2019,0,1,
332, Investigations on the effects of mouthrinses on the colour stability and surface roughness of different dental bioceramics,"K. Soygun, O. Varol, A. Ozer and G. Bolayir", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: In this study, three bioceramic materials, [IPS Empress CAD (Ivoclar), IPS e.max CAD (Ivoclar), and Lava Ultimate CAD (3M ESPE)] were treated with three commercial mouthrinses [Listerine, Tantum Verde, and Klorhex]; and changes in colour reflectance and surface roughness values were then quantitatively assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty ceramic samples, with dimensions of 2 × 12 × 14 mm, were prepared and divided into nine sample groups, except three control samples. The samples were immersed in the mouthrinse solutions for 120 hrs, and changes in colour reflectance and surface roughness values were measured by UV light spectrophotometry (Vita Easyshade; VITA Zahnfabrik) and by profilometer device (MitutoyoSurftest SJ-301), respectively. The change of surface roughness was inspected by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between the ΔE and increase in the surface roughness. Two of the ceramic materials, IPS Empress and Lava Ultimate, were affected significantly by the treatment of the mouthrinse solutions (P<.05). The most affecting solution was Tantum Verde and the most affected material was Lava Ultimate. As expected, the most resistant material to ΔE and chemical corrosion was IPS e max CAD among the materials used. CONCLUSION: This work implied that mouthrinse with lower alcohol content had less deteriorating effect on colour and on the surface morphology of the bioceramic materials.",2017,1,0,
144, Effect of immediate dentine sealing on the fracture strength of lithium disilicate and multiphase resin composite inlay restorations,"C. R. G. van den Breemer, M. Özcan, M. S. Cune, R. van der Giezen, W. Kerdijk and M. M. M. Gresnigt", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," PURPOSE: Limited information is available on the effect of Immediate Dentin Sealing (IDS) on the fracture strength of indirect partial posterior restorations. This study evaluated the effect of IDS on the fracture strength and failure types of two indirect restorative materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard MOD inlay preparations were made on sound molars (N=40, n=10 per group) and randomly divided into four groups to receive the inlay materials with and without the application of IDS: Group L-IDS-: Li(2)Si(2)O(5) (Lithium disilicate, IPS e.max) without IDS; Group L-IDS+: Li(2)Si(2)O(5) with IDS; Group MR-IDS-: Multiphase resin composite (MR, Lava Ultimate) without IDS; MR-IDS+: MR with IDS. Inlays made of L were etched with 5% hydrofluoric acid, and MR inlays were silica coated. After silanization, they were cemented using adhesive resin cement (Variolink Esthetic DC). The specimens were thermo-mechanically aged (1.2×10(6) cycles, 1.7Hz, 8000 cycles, 5-55°C) and then subjected to load to failure (1 mm/min). Failure types and locations of debondings were classified. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA, Mann Whitney U-test and Chi-square tests (α=0.05). Two-parameter Weibull distribution values including the Weibull modulus, scale (m) and shape (0), values were calculated. RESULTS: After aging conditions, no apparent changes were observed in marginal integrity but occlusal wear facets were more common with MR than with L (p<0.001). Material type and the application of IDS significantly affected the results (p=0.013). While group L-IDS- showed the lowest mean fracture strength (1358±506N) among all groups (p<0.05), application of IDS significantly increased the results significantly (L-IDS+: 2035±403N) (p=0.006). MR groups with and without IDS, did not show significant difference (MR-IDS-: 1861±423, MR-IDS+: 1702±596 N) (p=0.498). When materials without IDS are compared, L showed significantly lower results than that of MR (p=0.035). With the application of IDS, no significant difference was noted between L and MR materials (p=0.160). Weibull distribution presented the highest shape (0) for L-IDS+ (5.66) compared to those of other groups (3.01-4.76). Neither the material type (p=0.830), nor the application of IDS (p=0.54) affected the severity of the failure types. In 95% of the cases, the IDS layer left adhered on the tooth surface after fracture tests. In groups where no IDS was used, resin cement remained on the tooth surface in 44% of the cases (p=0.001). No significant differences were observed between the materials with respect to cement remnants or IDS after fracture (p=0.880). The incidence of repairable failure types (83%) was more common with L than with MR (75%) material (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Immediate dentin sealing improves adhesion, and thereby the fracture strength of inlays made of lithium disilicate but not that multiphase resin composite.",2017,0,1,
182, Effects of different surface finishing procedures on the change in surface roughness and color of a polymer infiltrated ceramic network material,"M. M. Özarslan, U. Büyükkaplan, Ç. Barutcigil, M. Arslan, N. Türker and K. Barutcigil", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: Polymer infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) materials, also called hybrid ceramics, are new materials in dental market. The manufacturer of the PICN material VITA Enamic suggests 3 different finishing procedures for this new material. In the present study, surface roughness and color differences caused from different finishing procedures of VITA Enamic were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 specimens were prepared in dimensions 2 × 10 × 12 mm from VITA Enamic hybrid ceramic blocks with 'high translucency' and 'translucency 2M2' shades. The specimens were divided into 8 groups. For each group, different finishing procedures suggested by the manufacturer were performed. Surface roughness values were determined by a tactile portable profilometer. Color changes were evaluated using a clinical spectrophotometer. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc comparison. The significance level was set at α=0.05. RESULTS: The roughest surfaces were observed in Glaze Groups. Their surface roughness values were similar to that of the control group. Clinical Kit and Technical Kit groups did not show a statistically significant difference regarding surface roughness (P>.05). The largest color difference regarding ΔE00 was observed in Clinical Kit finishing groups. There were also statistically significant color changes between the groups (P<.05). However, all the groups showed clinically acceptable color change (ΔE00<2.25) except Clinical Kit Groups (ΔE00>2.25). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the present study, it may be suggested that finishing the VITA Enamic restorations by Technical Kit instead of Glaze and Clinical Kit gives better clinical performance in regard to surface roughness and shade matching.",2016,1,0,
367, Micro-CT evaluation of marginal and internal fit of cemented polymer infiltrated ceramic network material crowns manufactured after conventional and digital impressions,"R. Dauti, B. Cvikl, B. Lilaj, P. Heimel, A. Moritz and A. Schedle", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: Purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of fit of cemented polymer infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material crowns manufactured after digital and conventional impression techniques using micro computed tomography (CT). Furthermore to determine the cement space volume and porosities in the cement layer. METHODS: A molar typodont tooth was prepared for PICN material crowns and replicated thirty times. The dies were randomly divided into three groups of 10 specimens each according to the impression technique: 3M True Definition Scanner (TDS), cara TRIOS (Trios) and Impregum Penta Soft (Impregum). PICN material crowns were milled for each specimen from Vita Enamic blocks and cemented on their respective dies. The absolute marginal discrepancy (AMD), internal fit (IG), total cement space volume (TVC) and marginal porosities (VP) were measured using Micro-CT. RESULTS: Mean and standard deviations values in μm for the AMD were: TDS 140.1 (28.4); Trios 253.7 (56.8); Impregum 220.2 (101.1). IG values in μm: TDS 173.1 (27.7); Trios 222.2 (22.4); Impregum 211.6 (55.9). TVC in mm(3): TDS 19.82 (2.9); Trios 23.67 (2.01); Impregum 23.77 (5.09). VP in mm(3): TDS 0.38 (0.09); Trios 0.36 (0.10); Impregum 0.51 (0.31). CONCLUSIONS: TDS group showed significantly better marginal and internal fit than the Trios group. No difference of the parameters was detected between the Impregum and both digital groups which implies that the digital impression technique is suitable in the manufacturing process of PICN material crowns.",2019,1,0,
263, How adjustment could affect internal and marginal adaptation of CAD/CAM crowns made with different materials,"M. Hasanzade, M. Moharrami and M. Alikhasi", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: Recently introduced hybrid and reinforced glass ceramic computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials have been used for full-coverage restorations. However; the effect of adjustment and type of materials on internal and marginal adaptation are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the marginal and internal adaptations of crowns made of three different CAD/CAM materials before and after adjustment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One acrylic resin maxillary first molar was prepared and served as the master die. Thirty-six restorations were fabricated using CAD/CAM system (CEREC Omnicam, MCXL) with three materials including lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (Suprinity), and hybrid ceramic (Enamic). Internal and marginal adaptations were evaluated with the reference point matching technique before and after adjustment. The data were analyzed using mixed ANOVA considering α=.05 as the significance level. RESULTS: The effect of adjustment and its interaction with the restoration material were significant for marginal, absolute marginal, and occlusal discrepancies (P<.05). Before adjustment, Suprinity had lower marginal discrepancies than IPS e.max CAD (P=.18) and Enamic (P=.021); though no significant differences existed after adjustment. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, crowns fabricated from IPS e.max CAD and Suprinity resulted in slightly better adaptation compared with Enamic crowns before adjustment. However, marginal, axial, and occlusal discrepancies were similar among all materials after the adjustment.",2020,1,0,
328, Interfacial Fracture Toughness of Adhesive Resin Cement-Lithium-Disilicate/Resin-Composite Blocks,S. Mesmar and N. D. Ruse, J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: Resin composite blocks (RCB) are advocated as alternative to ceramic blocks (CB). Prior to use, adherence to these materials should characterized. This study aimed to test the null hypothesis (H(0) ) that material and surface treatment combinations do not influence interfacial fracture toughness (K(IC) ) of a self-cured adhesive resin cement [RelyX Ultimate (RXU)] to RCB or CB, under nonaged and aged conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two RCB, Lava Ultimate (LU) and Enamic (EN), and one CB, IPS e.max Press (EMP) were used. Half-size [(6 × 6 × 6 × 6 mm)] specimens were prepared for EMP (n = 30), EN (n = 30), and LU (n = 60). RCB specimens were prepared by wet cutting/grinding, while CB specimens were pressed. Surfaces of EMP and EN were preconditioned with hydrofluoric acid (5%); surfaces of LU were sandblasted with either 27 μm alumina (LUS) or 30 μm silica-modified alumina Rocatec soft (LUR). All specimens were bonded with Scotchbond Universal adhesive and RXU. Additionally, twenty (4 × 4 × 4 × 8 mm) RXU specimens were prepared. All specimens were stored in water at 37°C and tested after 1 and 60 days. Interfacial K(IC) was determined with the notchless triangular prism specimen K(IC) test. Results were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Scheffé multiple means comparisons (α = 0.05). Preconditioned and selected fractured surfaces were characterized with scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: At 24 hours, LUS-RXU and LUR-RXU had significantly higher interfacial K(IC) than EN-RXU and EMP-RXU and were not different from K(IC) of RXU. Aging lead to a significant decrease in K(IC) of RXU and interfacial K(IC) of LUS-RXU, LUR-RXU, and EMP-RXU; interfacial K(IC) of EN-RXU was not affected. Based on the results, H(0) was rejected. CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of this study, at 24 hours, interfacial K(IC) of LUS-RXU and LUR-RXU was superior to EMP-RXU and EN-RXU. Aging in water at 37°C did not affect interfacial K(IC) of EN-RXU but adversely affected K(IC) of RXU and the other interfacial K(IC) . CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results suggest that RXU and its adherence to LU and EMP deteriorates upon exposure to water at 37°C. In making clinical decisions related to material selection, practitioners should consider in vitro results.",2019,0,1,
73, Clinical Evaluation of Indirect Particle-Filled Composite Resin CAD/CAM Partial Crowns after 24 Months,"M. Zimmermann, C. Koller, M. Reymus, A. Mehl and R. Hickel", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: Resin-based CAD/CAM compound materials might be promising for single-tooth restorations. Insufficient clinical data are available for this new material class. The purpose of this study was to describe initial clinical in vivo results for indirect particle-filled composite resin CAD/CAM restorations after 24 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Indirect particle-filled composite resin restorations were fabricated with a CAD/CAM method (CEREC Bluecam intraoral scanner, CEREC MCXL milling unit) by calibrated dental students. Forty-two partial crown restorations were seated adhesively in 30 patients with caries lesions or insufficient restorations (baseline). Strict inclusion criteria were defined for the patient collective. Follow-up evaluation comprised 40 restorations after 12 months and 33 restorations after 24 months. Evaluation criteria were modified FDI criteria with grades (1) to (5). Rating with FDI criteria (5) was defined as clinical failure. Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon-Test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The success rate of indirect particle-filled composite resin CAD/CAM restorations after 12 months was 95.0% with two debondings observed. The cumulative success rate for indirect particle-filled composite resin CAD/CAM restorations after 24 months was 85.7% with two tooth fractures and one debonding. Statistically significant differences were found for baseline and 24-month follow-up evaluation for anatomic form and marginal adaptation criterion examined in respect to FDI criteria guidelines (Wilcoxon-Test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates particle-filled composite resin CAD/CAM restorations having a clinical success rate of 85.7% after 24 months. Adhesive bonding procedures need to be ensured carefully. A longer clinical evaluation period is necessary to draw further conclusions.",2018,0,1,
372, Microleakage of porcelain and composite machined crowns cemented with self-adhesive or conventional resin cement,"M. Ghazy, O. El-Mowafy and R. Roperto", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: Resistance of machined crowns to microleakage when cemented with new self-adhesive cements has not been fully investigated. This study evaluated microleakage of machined crowns milled from porcelain and composite blocks and bonded to teeth with self-adhesive and conventional resin cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two freshly extracted premolars of similar shape and size were sterilized and mounted in resin blocks. Teeth received standard crown preparations with 1-mm circumferential shoulder finish line, flat occlusal surface reduced by 2 mm, and ideal angle of convergence. Prepared teeth were divided into two equal groups and assigned to either porcelain (Vita Mark II, Vident) or composite (Paradigm MZ100, 3M ESPE) blocks for crown fabrication. Optical impressions were captured for each tooth with the intraoral camera of a CEREC 3D machine. Crowns were designed and milled from both materials. Each group was then subdivided into two subgroups (n = 8) according to cement used (self-adhesive resin cement, RelyX Unicem, 3M ESPE or resin cement with self-etching adhesive, Panavia F 2.0, Kuraray). Following seating, a 5-kg weight was applied on the occlusal surface of the crown for 5 minutes. Specimens were then stored in water at 37°C for 24 hours. Specimens were thermocycled for 3000 cycles between 5°C and 55°C, then coated with nail varnish and immersed in a 2.0% basic red fuchsine dye solution for 24 hours. Teeth were then rinsed and sectioned mesiodistally and assessed under magnification for microleakage. A five-point scale was used to score degree of microleakage. Data were statistically analyzed with 2-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test. RESULTS: Crown material had no significant effect on microleakage (p= 0.67); however, cement type had a significant effect (p < 0.0001), with Panavia F 2.0 resulting in lower microleakage scores than RelyX Unicem. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the self-adhesive cement, the resin cement with separate primer/bonding agent resulted in significantly lower microleakage scores, irrespective of crown material.",2010,0,1,
499, The effects of different surface treatments on the shear bond strengths of two dual-cure resin cements to CAD/CAM restorative materials,"N. Turker, U. Buyukkaplan, E. K. Başar and M. M. Özarslan", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of surface treatments on the bond strengths between polymer-containing restorative materials and two dual-cure resin cements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, rectangular samples prepared from Lava Ultimate (LU) and Vita Enamic (VE) blocks were used. The specimen surfaces were treated using CoJet sandblasting, 50 µm Al(2)O(3) sandblasting, % 9 HF (hydrofluoric) acid, ER,Cr:YSGG laser treatment, and Z-Prime. Dual-cure resin cements (TheraCem and 3M RelyX U 200) were applied on each specimen's treated surface. A micro-tensile device was used to evaluate shear bond strength. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS 9.4v3. RESULTS: While the bond strength using TheraCem with LU or VE was not statistically significant (P=.164), the bond strength using U200 with VE was statistically significant (P=.006). In the TheraCem applied VE groups, Z-Prime and HF acid were statistically different from CoJet, Laser, and Sandblast groups. In comparison of TheraCem used LU group, there was a statistically significant difference between HF acid and other surface treatments. CONCLUSION: The bonding performance between the restorative materials and cements were material type-dependent and surface treatment had a large effect on the bond strength. Within the limitations of the study, the use of both U200 and TheraCem may be suggested if Z-prime was applied to intaglio surfaces of VE. The cementation of LU using TheraCem is suitable after HF acid conditioning of the restoration surfaces.",2020,0,0,
117, Effect of Aging on Stained Monolithic Resin-Ceramic CAD/CAM Materials: Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Surface Roughness,"S. Mühlemann, J. M. Bernini, B. Sener, C. H. Hämmerle and M. Özcan", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The aim of this in vitro study was to measure the effect of staining and artificial aging on the surface roughness of commercially available resin-ceramic computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials both quantitatively and qualitatively and to compare it to feldspathic material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test specimens (n = 15 per material) were prepared of CAD/CAM ingots from a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate, LVU), a polymer-infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic, ENA), and a resin nanoceramic (Cerasmart, CER). In the staining protocol, test specimens were (i) roughened in a standardized manner and (ii) stained with the manufacturer's recommended staining kit by means of photo-polymerization (Bluephase Polywave). The control specimens were prepared out of a feldspathic ceramic (Vita Mark II,VM2) and stained in a ceramic furnace. As negative control of each group, 15 specimens were prepared and polished in a standardized manner. Surface roughness (Ra) was measured after finishing procedures and after simulation of clinical service up to 5 years by means of toothbrushing. After each year of aging, one specimen per group was randomly selected for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Kruskal-Wallis test and paired post-hoc test were applied to detect differences between treatment groups (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: The mean roughness measurements of the stained CAD/CAM materials were 0.14 ± 0.04 μm (ENA), 0.15 ± 0.03 μm (LVU), 0.22 ± 0.03 μm (VM2), and 0.26 ± 0.12 μm (CER). In the polished CAD/CAM materials the measurements were 0.01 ± 0.01 μm (CER), 0.02 ± 0.01 μm (LVU), 0.02 ± 0.00 μm (VM2), and 0.03 ± 0.01μm (ENA). Irrespective of the restoration material, the applied staining protocol resulted in a higher surface roughness compared to the polished specimens (p < 0.001). After 5 years of simulated aging the mean surface roughness in the stained CAD/CAM materials were 0.22 ± 0.03 μm (VM2), 0.24 ± 0.09 μm (ENA), 0.25 ± 0.06 μm (CER), and 0.37 ± 0.09 μm (LVU). Aging had a significant effect on surface roughness in groups ENA and LVU (p < 0.001). SEM analysis showed that the staining layer on resin-ceramic CAD/CAM materials was partially removed over time. CONCLUSIONS: The applied staining protocol significantly increased surface roughness of CAD/CAM materials. Instability of the staining layer on resin-ceramic CAD/CAM materials could be anticipated over time as a consequence of toothbrushing, whereas feldspathic ceramic did not suffer from such aging effect.",2019,1,0,
15, A clinical evaluation of resin nanoceramic CEREC Omnicam restorations associated with several factors,"F. D. Oz, S. Bolay and S. Canatan", J Esthet Restor Dent," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical performance of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing resin nanoceramic posterior restorations fabricated by CEREC Omnicam system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven Lava Ultimate posterior restorations were placed in 44 patients by one operator. Restorations were cemented using a resin cement system (Duo-Link). The clinical performance of the restorations was evaluated with USPHS guidelines in a mean time of 45-month. Data were statistically analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) tests (SPSS 22.0, α = 0.05). RESULTS: Thirty-eight restorations in 26 patients were evaluated at recall examinations by two evaluators other than the clinician who had placed the restorations who were blinded to groups. The survival rates of Lava Ultimate were 86.8%. A total of 5 (13.2%) failures were found. After a mean time of 45-month survival rate of vital and non-vital teeth were 90 and 83.3% respectively. The failures were not significantly influenced by gender, tooth arch, restoration size, the treated region and vitality. CONCLUSION: Chair-side posterior resin nanoceramic restorations were clinically successful restorations with a survival rate of 86.8% after a mean time of 45-month. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chair-side CAD/CAM resin nanoceramic restorations can be a successful choice for vital and non-vital teeth with acceptable survival rates.",2021,1,0,
274, In silico non-linear dynamic analysis reflecting in vitro physical properties of CAD/CAM resin composite blocks,"O. Karaer, S. Yamaguchi, Y. Nakase, C. Lee and S. Imazato", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the validity of in silico models of three-point bending tests to reflect in vitro physical properties obtained from three commercially available computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) resin composite blocks and demonstrate notchless triangular prism analysis with those properties. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three types of commercially available CAD/CAM resin composite blocks were used: Cerasmart 300 (CS300; GC, Tokyo, Japan), Katana Avencia P Block (AP; Kuraray Noritake Dental, Tokyo, Japan), and KZR CAD HR3 Gamma Theta (GT; Yamakin, Osaka, Japan). In vitro/in silico three-point bending tests were conducted to obtain elastic modulus and fracture strain for non-linear dynamic finite element analysis (n = 10/each). Fractured surfaces of specimens after in vitro NTP tests were observed, and the fracture toughness of each CAD/CAM resin composite was obtained by in silico NTP analysis. RESULTS: Both in vitro and in silico load-displacement curves obtained from three-point bending tests were significantly correlated (p < 0.05). The elastic moduli of CS300, AP, and GT were 8.0 GPa, 10.0 GPa, and 9.0 GPa, respectively. The fracture toughness values obtained from in silico NTP analysis of CS300, AP, and GT were 5.057 MPa m(1/2), 4.193 MPa m(1/2), and 4.880 MPa m(1/2), respectively. There was no significant difference in the length of the stable region among the three CAD/CAM resin composites (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: The in silico approach established in this study showed acceptable reflection of in vitro physical properties and will be useful for assessing fracture toughness related to the longevity of CAD/CAM resin composites without wastage of materials.",2020,0,1,
430, Repair of aged polymer-based CAD/CAM ceramics treated with different bonding protocols,E. Bayazıt, Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the microtensile bond strength (μTBS) of different CAD/CAM polymer-based ceramics to a repair composite resin using various bonding protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three different CAD/CAM polymer-based ceramics (LAVA Ultimate [LU], 3M ESPE; VITA Enamic [VE], VITA Zahnfabrik; and CeraSmart [CS], GC) were used. Ceramic slices were obtained and subjected to thermal cycling between 5°C and 55°C for 5,000 cycles with a 30-second dwell time. The samples were randomly separated into the following groups: universal adhesive (UB); hydrofluoric acid (HF); sandblasting (SN); HF + UB; HF + ceramic primer (PR) + adhesive (GB); SN + UB; and SN + PR + GB. The repair composite resin (G-aenial Universal Flo, GC) was applied to the samples and subjected to re-aging between 5°C and 55°C for an additional 5,000 cycles. Parallel sections were removed from the specimens, and multiple beam-shaped micro sticks (1.0 mm × 1.0 mm × 10 mm) were prepared for each group. Subsequently, the μTBS test was performed, and the obtained data were statistically analyzed via one- and two-way analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc tests. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Significant differences were found among the experimental groups (P < .05). The μTBS values of the UB bond groups were higher than those with the GB bond. The effect of pretreatment on μTBS (η(P)(2) = 0.556) was more significant than ceramic type (η(P)(2) = 0.481), and this result was supported by the SEM images. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment before application of universal adhesive is still needed to repair hybrid ceramic restorations with composite resins.",2021,1,0,
224, Fatigue resistance and microleakage of CAD/CAM ceramic and composite molar crowns,"A. S. Kassem, O. Atta and O. El-Mowafy", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine effect of compressive cyclic loading on fatigue resistance and microleakage of monolithic CAD/CAM molar ceramic and composite crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two extracted molars were prepared to receive CEREC crowns according to manufacturer's guidelines using a special paralleling device (Parallel-A-Prep). Sixteen feldspathic ceramic crowns (VITABLOCS Mark II) (VMII) and 16 resin-composite crowns (Paradigm-MZ100 blocks) (PMZ) were milled using a CEREC-3D machine. Eight crowns of each group were cemented to their respective teeth using self-etching resin cement (Panavia-F-2.0) (PAN), and eight were cemented using self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX-Unicem-Clicker) (RXU). Following storage for 1 week in water, specimens were subjected to uniaxial compressive cyclic loading in an Instron testing machine at 12 Hz for 1,000,000 cycles. Load was applied at the central fossa, and the cycle range was 60-600 N. Specimens were then subjected to microleakage testing. Data were statistically analyzed using factorial ANOVA and Post Hoc (Tukey HSD) tests. RESULTS: All composite crowns survived compressive cyclic loading without fracture, while three ceramic crowns from the subgroup cemented with RXU developed surface cracks at the center of occlusal surfaces, extending laterally. Microleakage scores of ceramic crowns cemented with PAN were significantly lower than those of the other three subgroups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: After 1,000,000 cycles of compressive cyclic loading, PMZ composite molar crowns were more fatigue-resistant than VMII ceramic crowns. Cement type had a significant effect on fatigue resistance of the ceramic crowns but not the composite ones. Microleakage scores of ceramic crowns cemented with PAN were significantly lower than those of the other subgroups (p < 0.05).",2012,0,1,
162, Effect of surface finishing treatments on the color stability of CAD/CAM materials,"F. Ozen, N. Demirkol and O. Parlar Oz", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different surface finishing processes on the color stabilities of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics, zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramics, and resin nanoceramics after artificial ageing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 216 samples were prepared from 3 different CAD/CAM materials (LAVA Ultimate, IPS e.max CAD, VITA Suprinity) with A1 HT color at a size of 14 × 12 mm and a thickness of 0.5 ± 0.05 mm. Color measurements of the samples were performed with a spectrophotometer using color parameters and CIE Lab color system on a gray backing between baseline color and after 5000 cycles of artificial ageing in 4 stages (i.e. the first measurement before the treatment, the second measurement after polishing, the third measurement after cement application, and the fourth measurement after artificial ageing). The results were evaluated using the Variance analysis and Fisher's LSD test. RESULTS: Resin nanoceramics (LU) exhibited higher color change values than zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (VS) and lithium disilicate (EC) ceramics after artificial ageing. Manual polishing and glazing resulted in similar color change for LU and VS (P>.05). In the EC group, glazing provided statistically different results as compared to the manual polishing and control groups (P<.05). Among the ceramic groups, color change values of the subgroup, which was treated by glazing, of the zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (VS) and lithium disilicate (EC) samples were below the clinically acceptable level (ΔE < 3.5). CONCLUSION: The lowest color change for all stages was observed in Vita Suprinity.",2020,1,0,
368, Micro-shear bond strength of different resin cements to ceramic/glass-polymer CAD-CAM block materials,"I. Cekic-Nagas, G. Ergun, F. Egilmez, P. K. Vallittu and L. V. Lassila", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hydrofluoric acid treatment on bond strength of resin cements to three different types of ceramic/glass containing CAD-CAM block composite materials. METHODS: CAD-CAM block materials of polymer infiltrated (Vita Enamic), resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate) and nanoceramic (Cerasmart) with a thickness of 1.5mm were randomly divided into two groups according to the surface treatment performed. In Group 1, specimens were wet-ground with silicon carbide abrasive papers up to no. 1000. In Group 2, 9.6% hydrofluoric acid gel was applied to ceramics. Three different resin cements (RelyX, Variolink Esthetic and G-CEM LinkAce) were applied to the tubes in 1.2-mm thick increments and light-cured for 40s using LED light curing unit. Half of the specimens (n=10) were submitted to thermal cycling (5000 cycles, 5-55°C). The strength measurements were accomplished with a universal testing machine (Lloyd Instruments) at a cross-head speed of 0.5mm/min until the failure occurs. Failure modes were examined using a stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope. The data were analyzed with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc tests (α=0.05). RESULTS: There were significant differences between ceramics and resin cements (p<0.001). However, hydrofluoric acid gel treatment had no effect on bond strength values (p=0.073). In addition, thermal cycling significantly decreased bond strength values of resin cements to ceramics (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of appropriate resin cement systems with different ceramic/glass-polymer materials might promote the bonding capacity of these systems.",2016,1,1,
378, Microtensile bond strength and micromorphologic analysis of surface-treated resin nanoceramics,J. H. Park and Y. S. Choi, J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different surface treatment methods on the microtensile bond strength of resin cement to resin nanoceramic (RNC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNC onlays (Lava Ultimate) (n=30) were treated using air abrasion with and without a universal adhesive, or HF etching followed by a universal adhesive with and without a silane coupling agent, or tribological silica coating with and without a universal adhesive, and divided into 6 groups. Onlays were luted with resin cement to dentin surfaces. A microtensile bond strength test was performed and evaluated by one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD test (α=.05). A nanoscratch test, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used for micromorphologic analysis (α=.05). The roughness and elemental proportion were evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Tribological silica coating showed the highest roughness, followed by air abrasion and HF etching. After HF etching, the RNC surface presented a decrease in oxygen, silicon, and zirconium ratio with increasing carbon ratio. Air abrasion with universal adhesive showed the highest bond strength followed by tribological silica coating with universal adhesive. HF etching with universal adhesive showed the lowest bond strength. CONCLUSION: An improved understanding of the effect of surface treatment of RNC could enhance the durability of resin bonding when used for indirect restorations. When using RNC for restoration, effective and systemic surface roughening methods and an appropriate adhesive are required.",2016,1,0,
145, Effect of indirect restorative material and thickness on light transmission at different wavelengths,"R. R. Pacheco, A. O. Carvalho, C. B. André, A. P. A. Ayres, R. B. C. de Sá, T. M. Dias, F. A. Rueggeberg and M. Giannini", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of indirect restorative material type and thickness on the transmission of different wavelengths from a broad-banded dental curing light. METHODS: Four dental indirect restorative materials for computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) were evaluated: [RC] resin/ceramic hybrid material (Lava Ultimate), [FC] feldspathic ceramic (VitaBlocs), and two zirconia-based ceramics ([ZK] Katana; and [ZL] Lava). Total loss of irradiance (TL) was measured for blue (W(B,) 425-490nm) and violet (W(V,) 350-425nm) wavelengths. Specimens of 15×15mm with varying thicknesses (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0mm) were fabricated (n=5). A plasma-arc dental light-curing unit was used (Arc Light-II). To assess TL as a function of wavelength, a software (Spectra Suite v5.1) connected to a spectroradiometer (USB2000) and an integrating sphere (CTSM-LSM-60-SF) was used. Data was subjected to statistical analysis (two-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey test, α=0.05). RESULTS: A 0.5mm interposition resulted in TL from 50.5 to 67.2%, depending on material. Increased thickness resulted in higher TL for all materials. FC showed less TL compared to ZK. In general, W(V) showed higher TL than did W(B,) and W(V)/W(B) proportion decreased with increasing thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect materials significantly reduced TL, and this effect is greater with increasing thickness. W(V) showed lower penetration compared to W(B).",2019,1,0,
494, The effect of milling and postmilling procedures on the surface roughness of CAD/CAM materials,"E. G. Mota, L. N. Smidt, L. M. Fracasso, L. H. Burnett, Jr. and A. M. Spohr", J Esthet Restor Dent," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the surface roughness and analyze the surface topography of five different CAD/CAM ceramics and one CAD/CAM composite resin for CEREC after milling and postmilling procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blocks of the ceramics Mark II, IPS Empress CAD, IPS e.max CAD, Suprinity and Enamic, and blocks of the composite resin Lava Ultimate were milled at CEREC MCXL. Ten flat samples of each material were obtained. The surface roughness (Ra) test was performed before and after milling, crystallization, polishing, and glaze when indicated, followed by SEM and AFM analysis. Data were submitted to one-way ANOVA with repeated measures and the Tukey HSD test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The milling step significantly increased the roughness of all the tested materials (P < .05). Lithium-based ceramics (IPS e.max CAD and Suprinity) were more suitable to roughness than the other tested materials (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The polishing methods were able to reduce roughness to baseline values, except for lithium-based ceramics. Glaze reduced significantly the roughness of lithium-based ceramics without a difference from the baseline. SEM and AFM images revealed that glazed surfaces are smoother than polished surfaces. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: All hard-milling CAD/CAM materials, that is, fully sintered, should be only hand polished. The glaze step can be suppressed resulting in time saving. However, the glaze step in soft-milling lithium disilicate is imperative.",2017,0,1,
466, Static and fatigue mechanical behavior of three dental CAD/CAM ceramics,"E. Homaei, K. Farhangdoost, J. K. H. Tsoi, J. P. Matinlinna and E. H. N. Pow", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to measure the mechanical properties and fatigue behavior of three contemporary used dental ceramics, zirconia Cercon(®) (ZC), lithium disilicate e.max(®) CAD (LD), and polymer-infiltrated ceramic Enamic(®) (PIC). METHODS: Flexural strength of each CAD/CAM ceramic was measured by three point bending (n=15) followed by Weibull analysis. Elastic modulus was calculated from the load-displacement curve. For cyclic fatigue loading, sinusoidal loading with a frequency of 8Hz with minimum load 3N were applied to these ceramics (n=24) using three point bending from 10(3) to 10(6) cycles. Fatigue limits of these ceramics were predicted with S-N fatigue diagram. Fracture toughness and Vickers hardness of the ceramics were measured respectively by single edge V-notch beam (SEVNB) and microindentation (Hv 0.2) methods. Chemical compositions of the materials׳ surfaces were analyzed by EDS, and microstructural analysis was conducted on the fracture surfaces by SEM. One-way ANOVA was performed and the level of significance was set at 0.05 to analyze the numerical results. RESULTS: The mean flexural strength of ZC, LD, and PIC was respectively 886.9, 356.7, and 135.8MPa. However, the highest Weibull modulus belonged to PIC with 19.7 and the lowest was found in LD with 7.0. The fatigue limit of maximum load for one million cycles of ZC, LD, and PIC was estimated to be 500.1, 168.4, and 73.8GPa. The mean fracture toughness of ZC, LD, and PIC was found to be respectively 6.6, 2.8, and 1.4MPam(1/2), while the mean Vickers hardness was 1641.7, 676.7, and 261.7Hv. Fracture surfaces followed fatigue loading appeared to be smoother than that after monotonic loading. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical properties of ZC were substantially superior to the two other tested ceramics, but the scattering of data was the least in PIC. The fatigue limit was found to be approximately half of the mean flexural strength for all tested ceramics.",2016,1,0,
252, Fracture Strength of Monolithic All-Ceramic Crowns on Titanium Implant Abutments,"M. Weyhrauch, C. Igiel, H. Scheller, G. Weibrich and K. M. Lehmann", Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants," PURPOSE: The fracture strengths of all-ceramic crowns cemented on titanium implant abutments may vary depending on crown materials and luting agents. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in fracture strength among crowns cemented on implant abutments using crowns made of seven different monolithic ceramic materials and five different luting agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 525 crowns (75 each of Vita Mark II, feldspathic ceramic [FSC]; Ivoclar Empress CAD, leucite-reinforced glass ceramic [LrGC]; Ivoclar e.max CAD, lithium disilicate [LiDS]; Vita Suprinity, presintered zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic [PSZirLS]; Vita Enamic, polymer-reinforced fine-structure feldspathic ceramic [PolyFSP], Lava Ultimate; resin nanoceramic [ResNC], Celtra Duo; fully crystallized zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate [FcZirLS]) were milled using a CAD/CAM system. The inner surfaces of the crowns were etched and silanized. Titanium implant abutments were fixed on implant analogs, and airborne-particle abrasion was used on their exterior specific adhesion surfaces (Al2O3, 50 μm). Then, the abutments were degreased and silanized. The crowns were cemented on the implant abutments using five luting agents (Multilink Implant, Variolink II, RelyX Unicem, GC FujiCEM, Panavia 2.0). After thermocycling for 5,000 cycles (5 to 55°C, 30 seconds dwell time), the crowns were subjected to fracture strength testing under static load using a universal testing machine. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance (α = .0002) and the Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: No significant difference among the luting agents was found using the different all-ceramic materials. Ceramic materials LiDS, PSZirLS, PolyFSP, and ResNC showed significantly higher fracture strength values compared with FSC, FcZirLS, and LrGC. The PSZirLS especially showed significantly better results. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, fracture strength was not differentially affected by the various luting agents. However, the fracture strength was significantly higher for PSZirLS, PolyFSP, ResNC, and LiDS ceramics than for the FSP, LrGC, and the FcZirLS ceramic with all luting agents tested.",2016,1,0,
340, Load-bearing capacity of various CAD/CAM monolithic molar crowns under recommended occlusal thickness and reduced occlusal thickness conditions,"S. Choi, H. I. Yoon and E. J. Park", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistances of various monolithic crowns fabricated by computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) with different thickness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test dies were fabricated as mandibular molar forms with occlusal reductions using CAD/CAM. With different occlusal thickness (1.0 or 1.5 mm), a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (Enamic, EN), and zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (Suprinity, SU and Celtra-Duo, CD) were used to fabricate molar crowns. Lithium disilicate (e.max CAD, EM) crowns (occlusal: 1.5 mm) were fabricated as control. Seventy crowns (n=10 per group) were bonded to abutments and stored in water for 24 hours. A universal testing machine was used to apply load to crown until fracture. The fractured specimens were examined with a scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The type of ceramics and the occlusal thickness showed a significant interaction. With a recommended thickness (1.5 mm), the SU revealed the mean load similar to the EM, higher compared with those of the EN and CD. The fracture loads in a reduced thickness (1.0 mm) were similar among the SU, CD, and EN. The mean fracture load of the SU and CD enhanced significantly when the occlusal thickness increased, whereas that of the EN did not. CONCLUSION: The fracture loads of monolithic crowns were differently influenced by the changes in occlusal thickness, depending on the type of ceramics. Within the limitations of this study, all the tested crowns withstood the physiological masticatory loads both at the recommended and reduced occlusal thickness.",2017,1,0,
24, Adhesion procedure for CAD/CAM resin crown bonding: Reduction of bond strengths due to artificial saliva contamination,"A. Kawaguchi-Uemura, A. Mine, M. Matsumoto, Y. Tajiri, M. Higashi, T. Kabetani, R. Hagino, D. Imai, T. Minamino, J. Miura and H. Yatani", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: The present study aimed to elucidate how saliva contamination affects microtensile bond strength of resin cement to CAD/CAM resin blocks and identify a decontamination method that can restore original bond strength. METHODS: The KATANA AVENCIA block (Kuraray Noritake Dental) was sandblasted on the adherend surface (P-Co group). Then, the block was contaminated with artificial saliva (Saliveht Aerosol, Teijin). Air dry (N-Co), sandblasting (Sb) and phosphate acid cleaning (AT) groups were prepared. After silane treatment, PANAVIA V5 (Kuraray Noritake Dental) was built up and microtensile bond strength (μTBS) was measured after immersion in water (n=24 per group). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, surface roughness and contact angle measurement of each surface were performed. RESULTS: The P-Co group showed the highest μTBS value, and bond strength was significantly lower in the N-Co group than the other groups (P<0.001). In all groups, decreased bond strength resulted from long-term water storage. In the N-Co group, a contaminated layer was observed on the surface by SEM and the contact angle was significantly smaller than the other groups (P<0.001). In Sb and AT groups, μTBS values that were reduced by artificial saliva contamination significantly increased but did not recover to P-Co group values (P<0.001). SEM showed no morphological difference between P-Co, Sb and AT groups. The Sb group showed increased surface roughness. CONCLUSION: The long-term durability of bonds between CAD/CAM resin blocks and luting agent cement was significantly reduced by artificial saliva contamination. However, sandblasting or phosphoric acid cleaning can recover bonding effectiveness by 75-85%.",2018,0,0,
241, Fracture resistance and failure modes of polymer infiltrated ceramic endocrown restorations with variations in margin design and occlusal thickness,"D. Taha, S. Spintzyk, C. Schille, A. Sabet, M. Wahsh, T. Salah and J. Geis-Gerstorfer", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess the effect of varying the margin designs and the occlusal thicknesses on the fracture resistance and mode of failures of endodontically treated teeth restored with polymer infiltrated ceramic endocrown restorations. METHODS: Root canal treated mandibular molars were divided into four groups (n=8) and were prepared to receive Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) fabricated polymer infiltrated ceramic endocrowns (ENAMIC blocks). Group B2 represents teeth prepared with a butt joint design receiving endocrowns with 2mm occlusal thickness and the same for group B3.5 but with 3.5mm occlusal thickness. Group S2 represents teeth prepared with 1mm shoulder finish line receiving endocrowns with 2mm occlusal thickness and the same for group S3.5 but with 3.5mm occlusal thickness. After cementation and thermal aging, fracture resistance test was performed and failure modes were observed. RESULTS: Group S3.5 showed the highest mean fracture load value (1.27±0.31kN). Endocrowns with shoulder finish line had significantly higher mean fracture resistance values than endocrowns with butt margin (p<0.05). However, the results were not statistically significant regarding the restoration thickness. Evaluation of the fracture modes revealed no statistically significant difference between the modes of failure of tested groups. CONCLUSIONS: For the restoration of endodontically treated teeth, adding a short axial wall and shoulder finish line can increase the fracture resistance. However, further investigations, especially the fatigue behavior, are needed to ensure this effect applies with small increases of restoration thickness.",2018,1,0,
186, Effects of New Generation All-Ceramic and Provisional Materials on Fibroblast Cells,"A. Atay, I. Gürdal, V. Bozok Çetıntas, A. Üşümez and E. Cal", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of seven new-generation all-ceramic materials for CAD/CAM (Lava Ultimate [LU], VITA Mark II [VM], InCoris TZI [IC], IPS e.max CAD [EM], VITA Suprinity [VS], Cerasmart [CS], IPS Empress CAD [EC]) and six provisional materials (Protemp 4 [PT], Telio CAD [TC], CAD-Temp [CT], Telio Lab [TL], Temdent Classic [TD], Telio CS C&B [TS]) on L929 mouse fibroblast cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 disc-shaped specimens (∅ = 5 mm, h = 2 mm) were prepared from each test material. Medium extracts were collected at the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days for each group and tested using the L929 cell line. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using XTT assay, and apoptosis was determined by Annexin-V/PI staining. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey's multiple comparison tests at a significance level of p < 0.05. RESULTS: The cell viability results among all-ceramic material groups after the 1st and 7th days of incubation periods showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). There were significant differences within the ceramic groups in different incubation periods regarding apoptosis rate (p < 0.05). Throughout the entire test period, LU and VM from the CAD/CAM all-ceramic materials and PT and TC from the provisional restoration materials showed cell viability higher than 90%. EC and TD showed the lowest cell viability and highest apoptosis rates in their own groups. For the provisional materials, there were significant differences in cell viability and apoptosis rate in all the incubation periods for each material (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although some new-generation CAD/CAM and provisional restoration materials display slight cytotoxicity values, the results are still within the reliable range, and they can safely be used in clinical conditions.",2019,1,0,
472, Surface deterioration of monolithic CAD/CAM restorative materials after artificial abrasive toothbrushing,"N. Şen, B. Tuncelli and G. Göller", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of abrasive toothbrushing on the surface properties of monolithic computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials stored in food-simulating liquids (FSLs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourty-eight disk-shaped test specimens of each material (Paradigm MZ100/PMZ, Lava Ultimate/LU, Vita Enamic/VE, and Vita Mark II/VMII) with a diameter of 10.0 mm and a thickness of 3.0 ± 0.05 mm were prepared. Specimens were divided into 4 subgroups (n=12) and stored in air, distilled water, 0.02 M citric acid, or 75% ethanol/water solution for 7 days at 36.5℃. Then, the specimens were brushed in a multi-station brushing machine under a vertical load of 2.0 N for 3 hours. Surface gloss (GU), roughness (Ra), and hardness (Vickers [VHN]) were measured after storage and brushing simulation. The data sets were statistically analyzed with 2 and 3-way ANOVAs followed by the Tukey's post-hoc comparisons (α=.05). RESULTS: Statistically significant difference was found among the materials concerning the results of surface properties. VMII showed the highest VHN, while PMZ produced the lowest. Storage in FSLs significantly affected the VHN of PMZ and LU. VMII showed the lowest Ra and highest GU irrespective of FSLs and of abrasive toothbrushing. VE, LU, and PMZ produced significant decrease in GU and increase in Ra after toothbrushing. CONCLUSION: Surface properties of monolithic CAD/CAM restorative materials were differently affected by the storage media and abrasive toothbrushing.",2018,0,0,
527, Wear and Fracture Strength of New Ceramic Resins for Chairside Milling,"K. Zierden, J. Acar, P. Rehmann and B. Wöstmann", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate wear and fracture strength of chairside-milled new ceramic resins after artificial aging in a chewing simulator. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two ceramic resins (Lava Ultimate and Vita Enamic) and two conventional ceramics (IPS Empress CAD and Celtra Duo) were tested. For analysis of wear, baseline and follow-up scans of the specimens were made, the scans were superimposed, and the wear was calculated. To determine fracture strength, the specimens were loaded until they fractured. RESULTS: Lava Ultimate showed the highest wear, caused the lowest wear of the opposing dentition, and showed statistically significantly higher fracture strength than conventional ceramics after cyclic loading. CONCLUSION: New ceramic resins for chairside milling are a good alternative to conventional ceramics.",2018,1,0,
428, Repair bond strength of resin composite to three aged CAD/CAM blocks using different repair systems,P. Gul and L. Altınok-Uygun, J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the repair bond strength of a nanohybrid resin composite to three CAD/CAM blocks using different intraoral ceramic repair systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three CAD/CAM blocks (Lava Ultimate, Cerasmart, and Vitablocks Mark II) were selected for the study. Thirty-two specimens were fabricated from each block. Specimens were randomly divided into eight groups for the following different intraoral repair systems: Group 1: control group (no treatment); Group 2: 34.5% phosphoric acid etching; Group 3: CoJet System; Group 4: Z-Prime Plus System; Group 5: GC Repair System; Group 6: Cimara System; Group 7: Porcelain Repair System; and Group 8: Clearfil Repair System. Then, nanohybrid resin composite (Tetric Evo Ceram) was packed onto treated blocks surfaces. The specimens were thermocycled before application of repair systems and after application of composite resin. After second thermal cycling, blocks were cut into bars (1 × 1 × 12 mm(3)) for microtensile bond strength tests. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test (α=.05). RESULTS: Cimara System, Porcelain Repair, and Clearfil Repair systems significantly increased the bond strength of nanohybrid resin composite to all CAD/CAM blocks when compared with the other tested repair systems (P<.05). In terms of CAD/CAM blocks, the lowest values were observed in Vitablocks Mark II groups (P<.05). CONCLUSION: All repair systems used in the study exhibited clinically acceptable bond strength and can be recommended for clinical use.",2020,0,1,
347, Marginal adaptation of Cerec 3 CAD/CAM composite crowns using two different finish line preparation designs,"J. H. Akbar, C. S. Petrie, M. P. Walker, K. Williams and J. D. Eick", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare marginal discrepancies of Cerec 3 CAD/CAM composite crowns, fabricated on human prepared teeth with two different finish line designs, chamfer and shoulder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen human molar teeth were used to prepare full crowns. Eight teeth were prepared with a 1-mm-wide chamfer finish line and the other eight with a 1.2- to 1.5-mm circumferential shoulder. Cerec 3 crowns were fabricated from optical impressions using Paradigm MZ100 composite polymer. Marginal adaptation was evaluated in two ways: (1) using modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria to evaluate eight preselected sites on each crown margin, and (2) using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to measure marginal gaps on all four axial walls with 15 measurements on each wall (60 measurements per crown). An evaluation of the number of acceptable crowns, determined by having all measured sites per tooth with margin gap size less than 100 microm, as a function of finish line design was also conducted. RESULTS: In both chamfer and shoulder groups, there were only two crowns (out of eight) with clinically acceptable ratings for all eight measurement sites according to USPHS criteria. Fisher's chi-square analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in marginal adaptability as a function of finish line design ( p>0.05). With SEM imaging, overall mean marginal gaps for the chamfer group were 65.9+/-38.7 microm (range 35.0 to 130.0 microm), and for the shoulder group were 46.0+/-9.2 microm (range 26.3 to 55.6 microm); this difference was not found to be statistically significant ( p>0.05). While crown assessment based on mean marginal discrepancy measurements indicated that both the chamfer and shoulder groups were considered clinically acceptable (<100 microm); crown acceptability based on all measurement sites being less than 100 mum indicated that in the chamfer and shoulder groups there were four and three acceptable crowns out of eight, respectively. The Fisher's chi-square test indicated no statistically significant difference between the groups ( p>0.05). An agreement rate of 81.2% was calculated between the two evaluation methods, modified USPHS criteria and SEM measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Based on mean marginal discrepancy measurements, the typical marginal assessment technique, Cerec 3 Paradigm MZ100 crown restorations appear to have acceptable marginal adaptability (mean discrepancies <100 microm). Thus, the evidence from this investigation would suggest that the finish line preparation design had no effect on marginal adaptation for Cerec 3 composite crowns.",2006,0,1,
84, Comparative color and surface parameters of current esthetic restorative CAD/CAM materials,"F. Egilmez, G. Ergun, I. Cekic-Nagas, P. K. Vallittu and L. V. J. Lassila", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to derive and compare the inherent color (hue angle, chroma), translucency (TP(SCI)), surface gloss (ΔE(*)(SCE-SCI)), and surface roughness (R(a)) amongst selected shades and brands of three hybrid CAD/CAM blocks [GC Cerasmart (CS); Lava Ultimate (LU); Vita Enamic (VE)]. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The specimens (N = 225) were prepared into square-shaped (12 × 12 mm(2)) with different thicknesses and shades. The measurements of color, translucency, and surface gloss were performed by a reflection spectrophotometer. The surface roughness and surface topography were assessed by white light interferometry. RESULTS: Results revealed that hue and chroma values were influenced by the material type, material shade, and material thickness (P < .001). The order of hue angle amongst the materials was LU > CS > VE, whereas the order of chroma was VE > CS > LU. TP(SCI) results demonstrated a significant difference in terms of material types and material thicknesses (P ≤ .001). TP(SCI) values of the tested materials were ordered as LU > CS > VE. ΔE(*)(SCE-SCI) and R(a) results were significantly varied amongst the materials (P < .001) and amongst the shades (P < .05). The order of ΔE(*)(SCE-SCI) amongst the materials were as follows LU > VE ≥ CS, whereas the order of R(a) was CS ≥ VE > LU. CONCLUSION: Nano-ceramic and polymer-infiltrated-feldspathic ceramic-network CAD/CAM materials exhibited different optical, inherent color and surface parameters.",2018,1,0,
107, Does artificial aging affect mechanical properties of CAD/CAM composite materials,"F. Egilmez, G. Ergun, I. Cekic-Nagas, P. K. Vallittu and L. V. J. Lassila", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the flexural strength and Weibull characteristics of different CAD/CAM materials after different in vitro aging conditions. METHODS: The specimens were randomly assigned to one of the six in vitro aging conditions: (1) water storage (37°C, 3 weeks), (2) boiling water (24h), (3) hydrochloric acid exposure (pH: 1.2, 24h), (4) autoclave treatment (134°C, 200kPa, 12h), (5) thermal cycling (5000 times, 5-55°C), (6) cyclic loading (100N, 50,000 cycles). No treatment was applied to the specimens in control group. Three-point bending test was used for the calculation of flexural strength. The reliability of the strength was assessed by Weibull distribution. Surface roughness and topography was examined by coherence scanning interferometry. Evaluated parameters were compared using the Kruskall-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Water storage, autoclave treatment and thermal cycling significantly decreased the flexural strength of all materials (p<0.05), whereas HCl exposure or cyclic loading did not affect the properties (p>0.05). Weibull moduli of Cerasmart™ and Lava™ Ultimate were similar with control. Vita Enamic(®) exhibited similar Weibull moduli in all aging groups except the HCl treated group (p>0.05). R(a) values of Cerasmart™ and Lava™ Ultimate were in the range of 0.053-0.088μm in the aged groups. However R(a) results of Vita Enamic(®) were larger than 0.2μm. CONCLUSIONS: Flexural strength of newly developed restorative CAD/CAM materials was significantly decreased by artificial aging. Cyclic loading or HCl exposure does not affect to the flexural strength and structural reliability of Cerasmart™ and Lava™ Ultimate.",2018,0,0,
192, Efficacy of Direct Restorative Materials in Proximal Box Elevation on the Margin Quality and Fracture Resistance of Molars Restored With CAD/CAM Onlays,"T. D. Grubbs, M. Vargas, J. Kolker and E. C. Teixeira", Oper Dent," PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of four direct restorative materials that can be used in the proximal box elevation (PBE) technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-five molar teeth were randomly assigned to one of five groups (n=15): type II glass ionomer (GI), type II resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI), resin-based composite (RBC), bulk-fill (BF) resin-based composite, and a control with no box elevation procedure. Specimens were prepared for a standard mesio-occlusal-distal, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufactured (CAD-CAM) resin, nanoceramic onlay with mesial cervical margins located 1 mm above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and distal cervical margins located 2 mm below the CEJ. PBE was used to elevate the distal margins to 1 mm above the CEJ in all groups except the control group. For the control group the onlay margin was placed directly on the prepared distal tooth structure without PBE. A Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM resin, nanoceramic onlay restorative was manufactured and bonded on all specimens with RelyX Ultimate adhesive resin cement. The quality of the tooth-PBE material and PBE material-onlay interface was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy using epoxy resin replicas before and after cyclic loading (100,000 cycles, 1.2 Hz at 65N and 37°C). In addition to margin quality, the fracture resistance of each group was measured using a universal testing machine. Fracture pattern was recorded by visual examination. The Levene test for homogeneity and the Welch analysis of variance were completed for fracture resistance and margin quality. A χ(2) test was completed for break mode. RESULTS: For dentin margins, a statistically significant difference was detected between the RMGI and control groups at baseline (p=0.0442). All other groups-GI, RBC, and BF-showed no difference from the control at baseline (p>0.05). No statistical significance was observed among groups for post-cyclic fatigue (p=0.8735). For onlay margins, no statistical significance was observed among groups for pre-cyclic fatigue, post-cyclic fatigue, or change (p=0.9713, p=0.528, p=0.4385, respectively). No significant difference was observed for the fracture resistance among groups or for the type of break by material used (p=0.1593, p=0.77, respectively). CONCLUSION: Within the parameters of this study, after mechanical fatigue, the materials used for PBE: RMGI, RBC, and BF, did not influence results in terms of margin quality and fracture resistance. Therefore, collective findings suggest that these materials might be suitable for PBE procedures. Nevertheless, clinical caution is recommended with any PBE procedure and further testing of GI materials is needed.",2020,1,0,
473, Surface Evaluation of Polishing Techniques for New Resilient CAD/CAM Restorative Materials,D. J. Fasbinder and G. F. Neiva, J Esthet Restor Dent," PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the surface roughness of milled chairside computer-assisted design/computer assisted machining (CAD/CAM) restorations using several contouring/polishing systems as to their effectiveness for creating a clinically acceptable surface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred onlays were milled from monolithic CAD/CAM blocks with an MCXL milling chamber (Sirona Dental) as follows: 30 resin nano-ceramic (Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE), 30 hybrid ceramic (Enamic, Vita) and 40 leucite-reinforced ceramic (EmpressCAD, Ivoclar). A single group of EmpressCAD onlays was glazed-fired in a porcelain oven (Programat CS2, Ivoclar). Finishing and polishing systems consisted of either an abrasive-polish technique or a brush-polish technique. Roughness values were measured using a three-dimensional measuring laser microscope (OLS4000 LEXT by Olympus). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the baseline surface roughness of the CAD/CAM materials (p ≤ 0.05), with the resin nano-ceramic (Lava Ultimate) being smoother than the hybrid ceramic (Enamic), and both being smoother than the leucite-reinforced ceramic (EmpressCAD). All polishing techniques resulted in a smoother surface compared with the baseline surface for the leucite-reinforced ceramic (p ≤ 0.05), with both techniques resulting in a significantly smoother surface than glazing in a porcelain oven (p ≤ 0.05). Both polishing techniques resulted in a smoother surface compared with the baseline surface for both the nano-ceramic and hybrid ceramic materials (p ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to create an equally smooth surface for chairside CAD/CAM resilient materials compared with milled ceramics using several finishing and polishing techniques. In general, the polished ceramic surfaces were smoother than the glazed ceramic surfaces. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the study indicate that it is possible to create an equally smooth surface for chairside CAD/CAM resilient materials compared with milled ceramics using several finishing and polishing techniques. In addition, both polishing techniques resulted in smoother ceramic surfaces when compared to glazed ceramic surfaces. The polished surface of the ceramic material was smoother than the glazed ceramic surface.",2016,1,0,
498, The effects of different polishing techniques on the staining resistance of CAD/CAM resin-ceramics,"O. Sagsoz, T. Demirci, G. Demirci, N. P. Sagsoz and M. Yildiz", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to evaluate the staining resistance of CAD/CAM resin-ceramics polished with different techniques and to determine the effectiveness of the polishing techniques on resin-ceramics, comparing it with that of a glazed glass-ceramic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four different CAD/CAM ceramics (feldspathic ceramic: C-CEREC Blocs, (SIRONA) and three resin-ceramics: L-Lava Ultimate, (3M ESPE), E-Enamic, (VITA) and CS-CeraSmart, (GC)) and one light cure composite resin: ME-Clearfil Majesty Esthetic (Kuraray) were used. Only C samples were glazed (gl). Other restorations were divided into four groups according to the polishing technique: nonpolished control group (c), a group polished with light cure liquid polish (Biscover LV BISCO) (bb), a group polished with ceramic polishing kit (Diapol, EVE) (cd), and a group polished with composite polishing kit (Clearfil Twist Dia, Kuraray) (kc). Glazed C samples and the polished samples were further divided into four subgroups and immersed into different solutions: distilled water, tea, coffee, and fermented black carrot juice. Eight samples (8 × 8 × 1 mm) were prepared for each subgroup. According to CIELab system, four color measurements were made: before immersion, immersion after 1 day, after 1 week, and after 1 month. Data were analyzed with repeated measures of ANOVA (α=.05). RESULTS: The highest staining resistance was found in gl samples. There was no difference among gl, kc and cd (P>.05). Staining resistance of gl was significantly higher than that of bb (P<.05). Staining resistances of E and CS were significantly higher than those of L and ME (P<.05). CONCLUSION: Ceramic and composite polishing kits can be used for resin ceramics as a counterpart of glazing procedure used for full ceramic materials. Liquid polish has limited indications for resin ceramics.",2016,1,0,
324, Influence of toothbrush abrasion and surface treatments on the color and translucency of resin infiltrated hybrid ceramics,"N. Labban, M. Al Amri, S. Alhijji, S. Alnafaiy, A. Alfouzan, M. Iskandar and S. Feitosa", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The study compared the color change, lightness, and translucency of hybrid resin ceramics exposed to toothbrush abrasion and surface treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hybrid ceramics [Lava Ultimate (LU), Vita Enamic (EN), Shofu HC (SH), and Crystal Ultra (CU)] were compared with a glass-ceramic (Vita Mark II) control. One hundred and twenty specimen blocks were prepared using a precision saw machine. Specimens in each material were divided into four subgroups based on the surface treatment (polishing or staining) and a storage medium (water or citric acid). Simulated tooth brushing with a mixture of 100 RDA (radioactive abrasives) with 0.3 ml distilled water was used for 3650 cycles (7300 strokes) for each specimen. Measurements for the color change, lightness, and translucency were measured after toothbrushing using a spectrophotometer. Statistical analysis compared outcomes using paired t-test, ANOVA, and Tukey post hoc test. RESULTS: The maximum color change was identified in SH (stained acid) [1.44 (0.40)], whereas the lowest was identified in EN (polished water) [0.66 (0.16)] material. The maximum and minimum loss of surface translucency was observed in SH (polished water) [12.3 (0.52)] and EN (stained acid) [6.5 (0.55)] specimens, respectively. Lastly, loss of lightness was the highest in VM (polished acid) [69 (0.95)], whereas the lowest was observed in CU (stained water) [56.7 (0.86)]. CONCLUSION: The comparison presented a significant effect of toothbrush abrasion on translucency and lightness of the hybrid resin ceramics. Color change was not significantly influenced irrespective of the storage medium employed. Surface staining demonstrated the preservation and stability of color and optical properties under the influence of toothbrush abrasion and chemical trauma.",2021,1,0,
108, Does the Translucency of Novel Monolithic CAD/CAM Materials Affect Resin Cement Polymerization with Different Curing Modes?,"Y. O. Caprak, P. Turkoglu and G. Akgungor", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: The translucency of CAD/CAM blocks influences the polymerization efficiency of resin cement used underneath. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of the translucency parameters (TPs) of current monolithic CAD/CAM blocks on the microhardness of light-cured or dual-cured resin cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 specimens were prepared from five types of CAD/CAM blocks (Mark II, Suprinity, Enamic, e.max, Ultimate), and their TP values were measured by spectrophotometry; 100 resin cement specimens (Duolink) were cured underneath five ceramic specimen groups by indirect LED light for 40 seconds with dual-cure (with catalyst) and light-cure (without catalyst) polymerization modes. Control group resin cement specimens (n = 20) were cured with both polymerization modes by direct LED light without any ceramic disc, making 120 resin cement specimens in total. The specimens were then stored in a dry environment for 24 hours before measurement of the polymerization depth with a digital micrometer. Vickers hardness measurements were performed at different resin cement sections. The results were statistically analyzed with 1-, 2-, and 3-way ANOVA, Student's t-test and Tukey's HSD test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The highest TP values occurred for Suprinity and Ultimate, whereas the lowest TP value occurred for Enamic (p < 0.01). The depth of cure and Vickers hardness values changed proportionally with TP value. In all specimens, dual polymerization provided higher depth of cure and Vickers hardness values than those obtained using light polymerization (p < 0.01). In all specimens except Enamic, the hardness value differences between the sections were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). In Enamic, the hardness values for both polymerization types decreased significantly in the deeper sections (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Lower depth of cure was observed as the amount of transmitted light decreased in the investigated materials. In clinical practice, light-cured resin cements may result in inadequate polymerization for ceramic materials with lower TP values. Zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate and nanoceramic resins may be reliable restorative materials for a restoration with both optimal esthetics and sufficient mechanical strength resulting from proper polymerization.",2019,1,0,
303, Influence of fatigue loading on fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored with endocrowns,"Y. Elashmawy, W. Elshahawy, M. Seddik and M. Aboushelib", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the influence of fatigue loading on fracture resistance of endodontically treated molars restored with endocrowns using different machinable blocks. METHODS: Endodontically treated mandibular first molars were prepared using a standardized method. Specimens were divided into 4 groups (n = 10).Anatomically shaped endocrowns groups were manufactured using VITA ENAMIC (VE) and KATANA Zirconia (KZ). Layered endocrowns groups were manufactured using IPS e.max CAD (EM) and BioHPP (BH). Half of the specimens of each group were subjected to fracture resistance test, while the other half were subjected to thermocycling and chewing simulation. After fatigue loading, specimens were loaded until failure. Specimens were examined using stereomicroscopy. Data were analyzed using ANOVA analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc test (α=0.05). RESULTS: KZ group had the highest initial fracture resistance value (1810.20± 119.56 N) and BH had the lowest value (579.50± 76.15 N). The reduction of fracture resistance after fatigue loading was significant for KZ group (1588.30±216.25 N) and BH group (502.60±11.53 N) and non-significant to VE group (1101.70±77.05 N) and EM group (1112.10±74.12 N). Failure modes of KZ and EM groups showed high percentage of non-restorable fractures, while VE and BH groups showed high percentage of restorable fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the following can be concluded: Poly infiltrated ceramics should be considered as a proper material to be used as an endocrown material because of its ability to be restorable if failure occurred.",2021,1,0,
5, [Comparison of mechanical properties of three machinable resin ceramic composite materials],"L. Y. Liu, J. J. Guo, Y. X. Du, Q. Wang and L. H. Qiu", Shanghai Kou Qiang Yi Xue," PURPOSE: This in vitro study was to compare the flexural properties, fracture toughness and hardness of three machinable composite materials. METHODS: Three kinds of resin composite ceramic Upcera Hyramic, 3M Lava Ultimate, Vita Enamic and a glass ceramic Vitablocs Mark II were chosen for the study. Bar-shaped specimens (16 mm×4 mm×1 mm, 2 mm) were prepared for flexural strength experiment; specimens (17 mm×4 mm×3 mm) were prepared for fracture toughness experiment and specimens of 4 mm thickness were prepared for hardness test. Flexural test and fracture toughness experiment were performed with an universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min. Hardness test was performed with an micro hardness tester.Scanning electron microscope was used to observe the roughness of fracture surface. One-way variance analysis was used to determine the statistical differences with SPSS 17.0 software package. RESULTS: The mean flexural strength of the tested blocks at 1 mm thickness was Hyramic（207.7515±13.12）MPa＞Vita Enamic（182.0286±15.18）MPa＞Lava Ultimate（145.8469±8.98）MPa＞Vitablocs MarkⅡ（103.0542±18.19）MPa. The mean flexural modulus were Vitablocs MarkⅡ（49.49±5.50）GPa＞Vita Enamic（40.65±3.80）GPa＞Hyramic（14.89±2.38）GPa＞Lava Ultimate（7.09±1.24）GPa. The mean flexural strength of the tested blocks at 2 mm thickness was Hyramic（208.1986±25.07）MPa＞Lava Ultimate（172.9297±12.73）MPa＞Vitablocs MarkⅡ（158.6587±15.37） MPa＞Vita Enamic（155.3670±13.77）MPa. The mean flexural modulus were Vitablocs MarkⅡ（24.07±1.86）GPa＞Vita Enamic（19.64±0.98）GPa＞Hyramic（10.35±0.87）GPa＞Lava Ultimate（8.68±0.86）GPa. The mean fracture toughness was Vita Enamic（1.6357±0.16）MPa·m(1/2)＞Lava Ultimate（1.4286±0.11）MPa·m(1/2)>Vitablocs MarkII（1.3233±0.10）MPa·m(1/2)>Hyramic（1.0614±0.09）MPa·m(1/2). The hardness of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: According to ISO 6872/2008, three kinds of machinable resin ceramic composites meet the needs of clinical strength.Hyramic showed higher flexural strength at different thickness, it is an ideal material for dental restoration. Vita Enamic has not only higher flexural strength at the thickness of 1 mm, but also good toughness, it is suitable for repair of patients that have limited occlusal space and great bite force, named occlusal veneer.",2019,1,1,
369, Micro-shear bond strengths of resin-matrix ceramics subjected to different surface conditioning strategies with or without coupling agent application,"B. Günal-Abduljalil, Ö. Önöral and S. Ongun", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the influence of various micromechanical surface conditioning (MSC) strategies with or without coupling agent (silane) application on the micro-shear bond strength (µSBS) of resin- matrix ceramics (RMCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: GC Cerasmart (GC), Lava Ultimate (LU), Vita Enamic (VE), Voco Grandio (VG), and Brilliant Crios (BC) were cut into 1.0-mm-thick slices (n = 32 per RMC) and separated into four groups according to the MSC strategy applied: control-no conditioning (C), air-borne particle abrasion with aluminum oxide particles (APA), 2W- and 3W-Er,Cr:YSGG group coding is missing. The specimens in each group were further separated into silane-applied and silane-free subgroups. Each specimen received two resin cement microtubules (n = 8 per subgroup). A shear force was applied to the adhesive interface through a universal test machine and µSBS values were measured. Data were statistically analyzed by using 3-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD test. Failure patterns were scrutinized under stereomicroscope. RESULTS: RMC material type, MSC strategy, and silanization influenced the µSBS values (P<.05). In comparison to the control group, µSBS values increased after all other MSC strategies (P<.05) while the differences among these strategies were insignificant (P>.05). For control and APA, there were insignificant differences between RMCs (P>.05). The silanization decreased µSBS values of RMCs except for VE. Considerable declines were observed in GC and BC (P<.05). CONCLUSION: MSC strategies can enhance bond strength values at the RMC - cement interface. However, the choice of MSC strategy is dependent on RMC material type and each RMC can require a dedicated way of conditioning.",2021,1,0,
495, The effect of resin cement shade and restorative material type and thickness on the final color of resin-matrix ceramics,B. Günal-Abduljalil and M. Mutahhar Ulusoy, J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of cement shade, restorative material type, and thickness on the final color of resin-matrix ceramics. METHODS: Ninety A2 shade resin-matrix ceramic specimens were prepared from Vita Enamic, GC Cerasmart, and Lava Ultimate at 0.5 and 1.0 mm thicknesses. Sixty resin cement disks were fabricated from different shades (A1, A3O, B05, and TR) of RelyX Ultimate at 0.1 mm thickness. CIE color coordinates were measured using a spectrophotometer, and color differences (∆ E 00 ) were calculated. Data were statistically analyzed (P =0.05). RESULTS: The ΔE 00 values were influenced by the cement shade, restorative material type, thickness, and their interactions ( P < 0.05). A3O cement caused clinically unacceptable values for all groups at 0.5 mm thickness and GC at 1.0 mm thickness. A1 and TR cement shades demonstrated visually perceptible but clinically acceptable values, except for VE-A1 and LU-A1 at 0.5 mm thickness. The ∆E 00 values of the B05 cement shade were lower than the visually perceptible threshold for both thicknesses except for GC at 0.5 mm thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The shade of the resin cement and the type and thickness of the resin-matrix ceramic material significantly affected the resulting final color. To provide a shade matching with natural dentition and to obtain esthetic restorations, especially for the anterior teeth, the resin cement shade and resin-matrix ceramic material should be carefully selected.",2021,1,0,
515, Three-dimensional trueness analysis of ceramic crowns fabricated using a chairside computer-aided design/manufacturing system: An in vitro study,"S. Y. Kang, J. H. Park, J. H. Kim and W. C. Kim", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: This study analyzed the trueness of polymer-infiltrated ceramic and glass ceramic crowns manufactured using the chairside computer-aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system. METHODS: The master model designs crowns using a CAD program after acquiring a digital impression with an intraoral scanner. Vita Enamic (VE), Vita Suprinity (VS), and IPS e.max CAD (IPS) were used to manufacture 10 crowns each (total: 30 crowns), using the chairside CAD/CAM system (inLab MC XL). Trueness was evaluated by superimposing the CAD data on the scan data using a three-dimensional program. The Kruskal-Wallis H test, a nonparametric test, and the Mann-Whitney U test were performed by applying the significance level (0.05/3=0.016), which was adjusted by post-analysis Bonferroni testing. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the trueness between the samples (p<0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the outer surface trueness between the samples (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the milling accuracy of VE is better than that of VS and IPS.",2020,1,0,
251, Fracture strength of minimally prepared resin bonded CEREC inlays,"E. Tsitrou, M. Helvatjoglou-Antoniades, K. Pahinis and R. van Noort", Oper Dent," PURPOSE: This study compared the structural integrity and fracture mode of teeth restored with traditionally and minimally prepared resin-bonded CAD/CAM inlays fabricated from the same material. METHODS: Forty intact maxillary premolars were used and divided into four groups. Two groups were prepared according to a traditional inlay preparation design (2.0 mm occlusal reduction, a 1.5 mm wide proximal box and divergent walls) and two groups were prepared according to a newly proposed minimal preparation design (round shaped cavity with 1.0 mm occlusal reduction, a U-shaped proximal box 1.0 mm wide and parallel walls). Two restorative systems were tested: a composite system comprised of Paradigm MZ100 (3M ESPE) blocks and RelyX Unicem (3M ESPE) resin cement and a ceramic system comprised of ProCAD blocks (Ivoclar-Vivadent) and Variolink II (Ivoclar-Vivadent) resin cement. The inlays were cemented according to the manufacturers' instructions. Each specimen was loaded axially to its occlusal surface at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/minute in a universal testing machine until fracture. The fracture load data were analyzed using ANOVA, comparing inlays of the same restorative material. Also, the mode of fracture of the inlays was recorded and analyzed using a non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis). RESULTS: In the composite system case, the mean fracture load and SD were 1322 N (+/- 445) for the traditional inlays and 1511 N (+/- 395) for the minimal inlays, while in the ceramic system case, those values were 1135N (+/- 450) for the traditional inlays and 1761 N (+/- 494) for the minimal inlays. Statistical analysis of the results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two designs for the composite system, while for the ceramic system, the minimally prepared teeth showed higher mean fracture strength. Non-parametric analysis (Kruskal-Wallis) of the mode of fracture showed that there was no statistically significant difference between traditionally and minimally prepared inlays for both systems (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this experimental study, only the ceramic inlays, when prepared with a minimal preparation design, demonstrated a higher fracture strength as compared to the traditionally prepared teeth. Use of the proposed minimal preparation design did not compromise the immediate post-operative structural integrity of teeth restored either with resin composite or ceramic inlays.",2009,0,1,
420, Radiopacity of Nonmetallic CAD/CAM Restorative Blocks,"S. Hosney, M. Kandil and O. El-Mowafy", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: This study determined the radiopacity of a group of computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture blocks using digital radiography and pixel monitoring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens 2.0 ± 0.05-mm thick were cut from nine different blocks. Longitudinal sections of the same thickness were obtained from molar and premolar. Specimens were assigned to one of two groups, and each group was placed on a digital radiograph sensor together with an aluminum step wedge. Following standardized technique, the sensor was exposed and two images were obtained from each group. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software to determine the number of pixels at five different locations for each specimen. Means and standard deviations were calculated and the data statistically analyzed. Radiopacity values were expressed as equivalent of aluminum thickness. RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed significant difference in mean pixels among the blocks (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The majority of blocks had radiopacity values that were higher than that of dentin.",2016,0,0,
208, Evaluation of the repair capacities and color stabilities of a resin nanoceramic and hybrid CAD/CAM blocks,H. S. Bahadır and Y. Bayraktar, J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: This study evaluated the color stabilities of two computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) blocks and a nanofill composite resin and the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) between the materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve specimens of 4 mm height were prepared for both Lava Ultimate (L) and Vita Enamic (E) CAD/CAM blocks. Half of the specimens were thermocycled (10,000 cycle, 5° to 55℃) for each material. Both thermocycled and non-thermocycled specimens were surface treated with one of the three different methods (Er,Cr:YSGG laser, bur, or control). For each surface treatment group, one of the thermocycled and one of non-thermocycled specimens were restored using silane (Ceramic Primer II), universal adhesive (Single Bond Universal), and nanofill composite resin of 4-mm height (Filtek Ultimate). The other specimens were restored with the same procedure without using silane. For each group, 1 × 1 × 8 mm bar specimens were prepared using a microcutting device. Bar specimens were thermocycled (10,000 cycle, 5° to 55℃) and microtensile tests were performed. Staining of the materials in coffee solution was also compared using a spectrophotometer. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, t-test and post-hoc Scheffe tests. RESULTS: µTBS were found similar between the thermocycled and non-thermocycled groups (P>.05). The highest µTBS (20.818 MPa) was found in the non-thermocycled, bur-ground, silane-applied E group. Silane increased µTBS at some E groups (P<.05). Composite resin specimens showed more staining than CAD/CAM blocks (P<.05). CONCLUSION: CAD/CAM blocks can be repaired with composite resins after proper surface treatments. Using silane is recommended in repair process. Color differences may be shown between CAD/CAM blocks and the nanofill composite after a certain time period.",2020,0,0,
20, A preliminary evaluation of the structural integrity and fracture mode of minimally prepared resin bonded CAD/CAM crowns,"E. A. Tsitrou, M. Helvatjoglu-Antoniades and R. van Noort", J Dent," PURPOSE: This study was a preliminary evaluation of two minimal preparation designs proposed for ceramic and composite resin bonded CAD/CAM crowns. It compared the structural integrity and fracture mode of teeth restored with traditionally and minimally prepared resin bonded CAD/CAM crowns fabricated from the same material hypothesizing that teeth restored with minimal resin bonded crowns would demonstrate the same fracture strength to teeth restored with traditional resin bonded crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty intact maxillary molar teeth were used and divided in four groups. Two groups were prepared according to a traditional crown preparation design and two groups were prepared according to minimal preparation designs. A resin composite (Paradigm MZ100, 3M ESPE) and a leucite glass-ceramic (ProCAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) were used for the fabrication of the crowns using CEREC Scan. Crowns of ceramic were cemented using Variolink II (Ivoclar Vivadent) and crowns of composite with Rely X Unicem Aplicap (3M ESPE) and loaded until fracture. Load data was analysed using ANOVA comparing crowns of the same restorative material. The mode of fracture was also recorded and analysed (Kruskal-Wallis). RESULTS: For the composite system the mean fracture load and SD was 1682N (+/-315) for the traditional and 1751N (+/-338) for the minimal crowns. For the ceramic system the mean fracture load and SD was 1512N (+/-373) for the traditional and 1837 (+/-356) for the minimal crowns. No statistically significant difference was found between the two designs for each system. Nonparametric analysis (Kruskal-Wallis) of the fracture mode showed no statistical significant difference between designs for either material (p>.05). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this experimental design, it was found that minimally prepared resin bonded CEREC crowns demonstrated equal fracture resistance and mode of fracture to that of crowns bonded to traditionally prepared teeth.",2010,0,1,
217, Fatigue damage of monolithic posterior computer aided designed/computer aided manufactured crowns,"M. A. Schlenz, A. Schmidt, P. Rehmann and B. Wöstmann", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: To analyse fatigue damage of monolithic computer-aided-designed/computer-aided-manufactured (CAD/CAM)-materials after loading with high masticatory forces in standardized posterior crowns in a mouth-motion-simulator. METHODS: For manufacturing of test specimens (5 groups, 16 specimens each), two corresponding Standard-Tessellation-Language-(STL)-data-sets (one for the teeth and one for the crowns) were designed. The teeth were CAD/CAM-milled of human third molars and the crowns of three different CAD/CAM composite blocks (Lava Ultimate,'LU'; Brilliant Crios'BC'; Cerasmart,'CS'), one polymer-infiltrated-ceramic network (Vita Enamic,'VE') and a control group of lithium disilicate ceramics (IPS e.max CAD,'EM'). Crowns were adhesively cemented with their corresponding luting system on the human teeth. Half of the specimens were light-cured ('LC') and the others were chemical-cured ('CC'). A mouth-motion-simulator (WL-tec, 2 Hz, 37 °C) applied dynamic cyclic loading between 50-500 N for a period of 1 million cycles. Afterwards, a dye penetration test (aqueous basic-fuchsine) revealed damage of test specimens. Each specimen was sectioned into four equidistant slices and the area without damage was measured with a digital microscope (Zeiss) and radial cracks at the cementation surface were assessed. Data were subjected to Tukey's test. RESULTS: All specimens showed fatigue damage in the occlusal contact area. LU, BC and CS exhibited a significant greater area without damage compared to VE and EM (p < .05). EM and VE showed additional radial cracks at the cementation interface in both curing modes, whereas LU, BC and CS showed only radial cracks with chemical-cured luting cement. CONCLUSIONS: Monolithic CAD/CAM composite crowns showed significantly lower fatigue damage, particularly if the luting system was light-cured.",2019,1,1,

Spitznagel", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To analyze the effect of material thickness on the fatigue behavior and failure load of monolithic polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network (PICN) computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PICN (VITA Enamic) molar crowns with standard (PICN-ST, 1.5 mm) and reduced (PICN-RED, 1.0 mm) thicknesses were investigated (n = 28). Monolithic zirconia (Z-ST, InCoris TZI) served as control. Failure loads before and after fatigue (1.2 million cycles, 198 N) were evaluated. Data were analyzed pairwise using Wilcoxon rank sum test, and resulting P values were adjusted using the Bonferroni-Holm method, with P < .05 considered significant and a prior power analysis. RESULTS: All crowns survived fatigue. Mean failure loads before and after fatigue (respectively) were as follows: PICN-ST: 1,889 ± 341 N and 2,547 ± 876 N; PICN-RED: 2,119 ± 338 N and 2,367 ± 719 N; and Z-ST 5,141 ± 1,194 N and 2,531 ± 682 N.

Marquezan, M. L. Grossi and H. M. Silva Oshima", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To analyze the marginal adaptation of computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufactured (CAD/CAM) porcelain laminate veneers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 three-dimensional (3D) machine-milled laminate veneers were divided into five groups of five each according to fabrication material (E-max; Empress; Lava Ultimate; Suprinity; and Vita Mark II) and cemented in 25 prepared acrylic central incisors. Digital microscopy images (×7.5 magnification) were analyzed for gaps in the mesial/distal surfaces of the prepared tooth and in the cervical, medial, and incisal thirds. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: All CAD/CAM laminate veneers except for Empress and Suprinity in the middle and incisal thirds showed good results (ie, gaps < 120 μm in the cervical, middle, and incisal thirds).",2018,0,0,
455, Shear bond strengths of aged and non-aged CAD/CAM materials after different surface treatments,"H. Kilinc, F. A. Sanal and S. Turgut", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To assess shear bond strengths (SBS) of resin composites on aged and non-aged prosthetic materials with various surface treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerasmart (CE), Vita Enamic (VE), Vita Mark II (VM), and IPS e.max CAD (EC) blocks were sliced, and rectangular-shaped specimens (14 × 12 × 1.5 mm; N = 352) were obtained. Half of the specimens were aged (5000 thermal cycles) for each material. Non-aged and aged specimens were divided into 4 groups according to the surface treatments (control, air abrasion, etching, and laser irradiation; n = 11) and processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The repair procedure was performed after the surface treatments. SBS values and failure types were determined. Obtained data were statistically analyzed (P≤.05). RESULTS: The material type, surface treatment type, and their interactions were found significant with regard to SBS (P<.001). Aging also had a significant effect on prosthetic material-resin composite bonding (P<.001). SBS values of non-aged specimens ranged from 12.16 to 17.91 MPa, while SBS values of aged specimens ranged from 9.46 to 15.61 MPa. Non-aged VM in combination with acid etching presented the highest score while the control group of aged CE showed the lowest. CONCLUSION: Etching was more effective in achieving durable SBS for VM and EC. Laser irradiation could be considered as an alternative surface treatment method to air abrasion for all tested materials. Aging had significant effect on SBS values generated between tested materials and resin composite.",2020,0,0,
493, The effect of light sources and CAD/CAM monolithic blocks on degree of conversion of cement,"A. B. Çetindemir, B. Şermet and D. Öngül", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To assess the degree of conversion (DC) and light irradiance delivered to light-cured and dual-cured cements by application of different light sources through various types of monolithic computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RelyX Ultimate Clicker light-cured and dual-cured resin cement specimens with 1.5-mm thicknesses (n=300, 10/group), were placed under four types of crystalline core structure (Vita Enamic, Vita Suprinity, GC Ceresmart, Degudent Prettau Anterior). The specimens were irradiated for 40 seconds with an LED Soft-Start or pulse-delay unit or 20 seconds with a QTH unit. DC ratios were determined by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) after curing the specimen at 1 day and 1 month. The data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test (for paired comparison) and the Kruskal-Wallis H test (for multiple comparison), with a significance level of P<.05. RESULTS: DC values were the highest for RelyX Ultimate Clicker light-cure specimens polymerized with the LED Soft-Start unit. The combination of the Vita Suprinity disc and RelyX Ultimate Clicker dual-cure resin cement yielded significantly higher values at both timepoints with all light units (all, P<.05). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, we conclude that the DC of RelyX Ultimate Clicker dual-cure resin cement was improved significantly by the use of Vita Suprinity and the LED Soft-Start light unit. We strongly recommend the combined use of an LED light unit and dual-cure luting cement for monolithic ceramic restorations.",2018,1,0,
312, Influence of Pretreatment Methods on the Adhesion of Composite and Polymer Infiltrated Ceramic CAD-CAM Blocks,"I. Emsermann, F. Eggmann, G. Krastl, R. Weiger and J. Amato", J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To assess the effect of different surface pretreatments on the shear bond strength of resin luting material on CAD-CAM composite resins and a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAD-CAM materials (Brilliant Crios, Cerasmart, Lava Ultimate, VITA Enamic) were subjected to the following pretreatments: no pretreatment; grit blasting; grit blasting + silane; HF etching + silane; tribochemical silica coating + silane; manufacturers' specifications; manufacturers' specifications + silane; manufacturers' specifications using only the manufacturers' products including their recommended luting materials (DuoCem, G-Cem LinkForce, RelyX Ultimate, RelyX Unicem 2). Specimens were luted with resin luting material according to the Swiss shear test design. After six months of water storage, shear bond tests were performed. Data were analyzed with multiple linear regression models and nested models (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Low bond strengths were obtained without pretreatment (Brilliant Crios 3.01 ± 0.54 MPa, Cerasmart 2.66 ± 0.47 MPa, Lava Ultimate 1.76 ± 0.26 MPa, VITA Enamic 2.83 ± 0.63 MPa). Grit blasting achieved high bond strengths across all materials (Brilliant Crios 5.17 ± 0.77 MPa, Cerasmart 4.27 ± 0.50 MPa, Lava Ultimate 3.98 ± 0.54 MPa, VITA Enamic 4.97 ± 0.90 MPa). Silane application tended to decrease bond strengths on CAD-CAM composite resins. Following the manufacturers' specifications and using their recommended materials achieved the highest bond strengths for all materials except Cerasmart (Brilliant Crios 5.75 ± 0.91 MPa, Cerasmart 2.82 ± 0.28 MPa, Lava Ultimate 6.63 ± 0.97 MPa, VITA Enamic 7.09 ± 0.77 MPa). CONCLUSION: Grit blasting and the application of a suitable material primer is a useful pretreatment for the bonding of CAD-CAM composite resins. Silane application on CAD-CAM composite resins may entail drawbacks, possibly owing to the scarcity of silanizable fillers.",2019,1,1,
247, Fracture Resistance of Molar Crowns Fabricated with Monolithic All-Ceramic CAD/CAM Materials Cemented on Titanium Abutments: An In Vitro Study,"D. O. Dogan, O. Gorler, B. Mutaf, M. Ozcan, G. B. Eyuboglu and M. Ulgey", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To assess the fracture resistance of single-tooth implant-supported crown restorations made with different CAD/CAM blocks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six titanium abutments were put on dental implant analogs (Mis Implant). For each of three test groups (n = 12/group), implant-supported, cement-retained mandibular molar single crowns were produced. Crowns were made of lithium disilicate glass (LD) IPS e.max CAD, feldspathic glass ceramic (FEL) Vita Mark II, and resin nano-ceramic (RNC) Lava Ultimate. The crowns were cemented with self-adhesive resin cement RelyX Unicem 2. After chewing cycling, crowns were tested to failure in a universal testing machine. Fracture values were calculated as initial (F-initial) and maximum fracture (F-max). RESULTS: The study groups were ranked, in order of having highest value, (LD > FEL) > RNC for F-initial load value and (LD > RNC) > FEL for F-max load value. This demonstrated that there was no parallel change in the F-initial and F-max values presenting the fracture resistance of specimens. CONCLUSIONS: There was no accordance between the F-initial and F-max values of the LD, RNC, and FEL after chewing simulation with thermocycling resembling 5 years of clinical functional use. LD had the highest fracture resistance during the fracture test. RNC had low fracture resistance; however, it had considerably high fracture resistance during the fracture test. FEL had considerably low fracture resistance values.",2017,1,0,
243, Fracture resistance force of primary molar crowns milled from polymeric computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufactured resin blocks,"A. Mete, Y. Yilmaz and S. S. Derelioglu", Niger J Clin Pract," Purpose: To compare fracture resistance force (FRF) and failure types of crowns milled from resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate)-, and modified polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (Vita computer-aided design (CAD)-Temp)-, and PMMA (Telio CAD)-based CAD/computer-assisted manufactured (CAM) blocks. Materials and Methods: Three experimental groups of 10 milled crowns were arranged: Group-1 (Lava Ultimate), Group-2 (Vita CAD-Temp), and Group-3 (Telio CAD). Crowns were machined in sizes similar to a primary second molar stainless steel crown (SSC) and stored in water at 37°C for 30 days. The crowns were seated on Cr-Co dies. Their FRFs were measured using a universal test machine until fracture. FRFs and failure types were recorded and statistically analyzed (P < 0.05). Results: There were statistically significant differences among the groups for both FRFs and failure types. The sources of significant differences for FRFs and failure types were Group-3 and Group-1, respectively. CONCLUSION: Crowns milled from different chemical structural CAD/CAM blocks may be used for restoration of primary molar teeth.",2018,1,0,
43, Bond strength of ceramic or resin CAD-CAM laminate veneers,"M. Bakir, S. Bakir and E. Bahsi", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To compare the bond strength of ceramic or resin laminate veneers produced using computer assisted design/computer assisted machining (CAD-CAM). METHODS: 80 teeth were prepared for laminate veneer, and divided into eight groups of different CAD-CAM blocks in each group. Each group was restored with the manufacturers' recommended procedures. After cementation of the veneers, all samples were thermocycled (1,000 cycles); the crowns of the teeth were embedded vertically into acrylic blocks and subjected to shear bond strength in a universal tester. Shear bond strength was determined in Newtons (N). RESULTS: The tests showed 52.5% cohesive failure, 30% adhesive failure, and 17.5% adhesive-cohesive failure (mixed). Lava Ultimate had the highest bond strength average and the Cerec blocks had the lowest with 82.2N. Lava Ultimate, Cerasmart, and E-Max's shear bond strength values were statistically different compared to Vitablocs Mark II, Cerec Blocs, GC Initial LRF Blocks (P< 0.05). The difference between the Vitablocs Mark II and Cerec Blocs and the Vita Enamic block was statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference among the other groups. The selected CAD-CAM material affected the shear bond strength of the laminate veneers. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study can assist clinicians in selecting materials with a high bond strength for laminate veneers.",2020,1,0,
478, Surface treatment effects on bond strength of CAD/CAM fabricated posts to root canal dentin,"B. S. Oguz Ahmet, F. Egilmez, G. Ergun and I. Cekic Nagas", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To compare the effect of different surface treatments on the bond strength of CAD/CAM fabricated resin-based and prefabricated fiber posts to root canal dentin. METHODS: 160 single-rooted human teeth were selected and received endodontic treatment. The teeth were divided into four groups according to the post material used: (1) Prefabricated fiber-reinforced composite post (Snowpost), (2) CAD/CAM nanoceramic (Cerasmart), (3) CAD/CAM polymer infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic) and (4) CAD/CAM resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate). Then the posts were randomly assigned into four sub-groups according to the surface treatment method used: (1) Control (no treatment), (2) Laser (Er,Cr:YSGG laser device, Waterlase), (3) Hydrofluoric acid treatment [ 9.6% HF (Pulpdent) for 2 minutes], and (4) Sandblasting (50 µm Al2O3). Following post space preparation, posts were cemented with dual-cure resin cement (Panavia SA cement plus). From each root, five 1 mm-thick slices were obtained. The micropush-out bond strength test was performed for each slice. Data were analyzed by using two-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests. The fracture modes were evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Representative specimens were analyzed with SEM following surface treatments. RESULTS: Micropush-out bond strength of posts to dentin was significantly affected by the type of post material (P< 0.05), but not by the surface treatment (P= 0.397). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Posts manufactured by CAD/CAM could be suitable options for restoration of severely affected endodontically-treated teeth.",2019,1,0,
169, Effect of thermal cycling on fracture toughness of CAD/CAM materials,"T. S. Porto, R. C. Roperto, A. Akkus, O. Akkus, S. Teich, F. F. Faddoul, S. T. Porto-Neto and E. A. Campos", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To compare the fracture toughness of four different CAD/CAM materials, (VM) Vitablocs Mark II, (IP) IPS e.max CAD, (LU) LAVA Ultimate, and (VE) Vita Enamic under long thermocycling conditions. METHODS: Each type of ceramic block was sectioned into beams (n=9) with dimensions of 14×3×2.5 mm (L × W × H). All four ceramics were submitted to different conditions: the desiccator or distilled water, each for 7 days. The third and fourth conditions involved the specimens being submitted to 60,000 and 120,000 thermocycles in water respectively. The dwelling time was 52 seconds at 5° and 55°C. A three-point bend test with a universal loading machine on notched samples was per-formed. Furthermore, a fractographic analyses was made by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine if any of these conditions influenced the type of fracture. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (α= 0.05). RESULTS: A significant difference in fracture toughness (P< 0.05) was found among the groups; IP (4.20±1.23) had the highest value followed by VE (2.02±0.39), which did not have a statistically significant difference from LU (1.96±0.42). The lower value and statistical difference for VM was 1.52±0.35. The ceramics performed better after they were hydrated, while the polymer-based materials had the fracture toughness means decreased after the thermocycles. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A significant difference in fracture toughness (P<0.05) was found among the groups; IP had the highest value followed by VE, which was not statistically significantly different from LU. The ceramics performed better after they were hydrated, while the polymer-based materials had fracture toughness means decreased after thermocycling.",2018,1,0,
308, Influence of mechanical and chemical degradation on surface gloss of direct and CAD-CAM resin composite materials,"S. Ardu, R. Daher, E. Di Bella, I. Rossier and I. Krejci", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To compare the gloss retention of four resin based materials, two direct resin composites (Tetric EvoCeram and Filtek Supreme) and two indirect resin composite CAD-CAM blocks (Tetric CAD and Lava Ultimate). METHODS: 36 samples of 1 mm thickness were readied of each test material and manually polished with polishing discs (Sof-Lex) up to the finest grit size. Three gloss measurements per sample were taken (one every 120 degrees of sample rotation) by means of a glossmeter (Novo-Curve) for a total of 60 values obtained per tested material. Samples of each material were then randomly divided into three equal groups and aged with 75% alcohol (Group 1), amine fluoride gel (Elmex gelée) (Group 2) or mechanical brushing (Group 3). Another set of gloss measurements was performed on all samples after 1 hour of aging. Gloss values were statistically evaluated by means of repeated measures ANOVA and Fisher's LSD post-hoc tests. RESULTS: Gloss retention values ranged from 59.0 (Tetric EvoCeram) to 70.9 (Lava Ultimate) for alcohol, from 59.3 (Filtek Supreme) to 67.5 (Lava Ultimate) for Elmex gelèe and from 33.3 (Tetric EvoCeram) to 53.4 (Lava Ultimate) for mechanical brushing. Statistical analysis revealed: (1) significant difference between intial and final gloss values for all materials and groups; (2) significant difference between final gloss values of all the materials in the alcohol group; (3) significant difference between final gloss values of Lava Ultimate and all the other materials in the Elmex gelèe group; (4) significant difference between final gloss values of Lava Ultimate and Tetric CAD with the other tested materials in the brushing group. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Direct resin composites in general are widely used, and CAD-CAM resin composite materials are becoming progressively more accessible. Making the choice between direct and indirect techniques is still a challenge, and understanding the advantages of CAD-CAM resin composites in the form of higher gloss retention, which translates into higher durability of esthetics, may be one the parameters facilitating the decision.",2020,0,1,
211, Evaluation of the Surface Roughness and Accelerated Aging of CAD/CAM Materials,"T. S. Porto, S. J. Park, A. J. Faddoul, F. F. Faddoul and P. F. Cesar", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To compare the influence of surface roughness and accelerated aging on the mechanical properties of polymer-based and ceramic CAD/CAM materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three polymers (Lava Ultimate [LVU], VITA ENAMIC [ENA], and Shofu Block HC [SFB]) and one ceramic (IPS Empress CAD [EMP]) were selected for this study. The specimens were treated with the aim of measuring surface roughness (Ra [mm]) and its influence on the mechanical properties. The treatments were: polishing (POL); etching with 9.6% hydrofluoric acid for 90 seconds (ETC); airborne-particle abrasion with 50-μm aluminum oxide at 2-bar pressure (SBT); and airborne-particle abrasion with 50-μm aluminum oxide at 2-bar pressure plus etching with 9.6% hydrofluoric acid (SAC) for 90 seconds. Before and after the accelerated aging (AA) protocol (30,000 cycles, 5°C and 55°C), the specimens were subjected to the 3-point bending test. The data were analyzed with two-way and three-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey test (P < .05). RESULTS: The surface roughness ranged from 0.24 μm to 1.96 μm, with statistically significant differences (P < .05). The highest surface roughness, in descending order, was exhibited by: LVU > SFB > EMP > ENA. The AA demonstrated an influence on the flexural strength of LVU, ENA, and SFB. The surface treatment did not affect the flexural moduli of the materials tested. The LVU and SFB showed decreased moduli of resilience after the AA; however, modulus of resilience was not influenced by surface treatment. CONCLUSION: The polymer-based materials were affected by AA. In addition, surface treatment could jeopardize their mechanical properties in certain conditions.",2020,0,0,
484, The crown materials and the occlusal thickness affect the load stress dissipation on 3D molar crown: Finite Element Analysis,"L. M. Martins, L. M. de Lima, L. M. da Silva, F. Cohen-Carneiro, P. Y. Noritomi and F. C. Lorenzoni", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To compare the mechanical behavior (stress load dissipation and/or concentration) of posterior crowns made from Lava Ultimate (LU; 3M ESPE) and IPS e.max CAD (LD; Ivoclar Vivadent) using finite element analysis (FEA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3D model of a mandibular first molar was prepared by reducing the occlusal surface by 1 or 2 mm (according to group), the axial walls by 1.5 mm, and using a 0.8-mm-deep shoulder margin as a finish line. A convergence of 6 degrees between opposing walls was set. Subsequently, four 3D crown models were created according to two test groups with two different occlusal thicknesses: (1) LD with 1.0 mm (LD1); (2) LD with 2.0 mm (LD2); (3) LU with 1.0 mm (LU1); and (4) LU with 2.0 mm (LU2). FEA models were constructed using the software Femap (Siemens). A load of 200 N was applied in the axial and oblique (20 degrees) directions for each group, and stress dissipation was viewed using the NEi Nastran software. RESULTS: FEA results demonstrated that the LU crowns dissipated the occlusal load to the tooth structure, whereas the LD material concentrated the load inside the crowns. For the LU material, the lower the occlusal thickness, the higher the stress concentration inside the crown became, and the 2.0-mm occlusal thickness transferred lower stress to the tooth structure. The oblique, rather than the vertical, load caused an increase in the maximum stress concentration at the shoulder margin and axial walls. CONCLUSION: The higher the Young's Modulus mismatch between the crown material and substrate, the higher the load stress concentration inside the material became. The 2-mm occlusal thickness acted by decreasing the load stress to the tooth substrate. Finally, the axial load delivered more favorable stress transmission to the tooth substrate. The crown material and the occlusal thickness appear to be two factors that affect the mechanical behavior of stress dissipation to the tooth structure.",2021,0,0,
27, Adhesive Failure of Lava Ultimate and Lithium Disilicate Crowns Bonded to Zirconia Abutments: A Prospective Within-Patient Comparison,"U. Schepke, U. Lohbauer, H. J. Meijer and M. S. Cune", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To demonstrate the influence of restorative material on the success of clinical bonding to zirconia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 participants with a single implant received screw-retained restorations; ie, Lava Ultimate (LU) crowns extraorally bonded to zirconia abutments. After 1 year, lithium disilicate (LDS) was used as an alternative restorative material. These restorations were also followed for 1 year. RESULTS: Forty LU restorations (80%) debonded within 1 year of clinical service, whereas no bonding failures occurred with LDS restorations. CONCLUSION: The choice of restorative material for single crowns luted to zirconia implant abutments strongly influences the incidence of bonding failures.",2018,0,0,
257," Fracture Toughness, Flexural Strength, and Flexural Modulus of New CAD/CAM Resin Composite Blocks",I. J. R. Lucsanszky and N. D. Ruse, J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To determine and compare the fracture toughness, flexural strength and flexural modulus of four new, commercially available CAD/CAM resin composite blocks and one new CAD/CAM lithium disilicate glass-ceramic block, tested under dry and aged conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three dispersed-fillers resin composite blocks, CERASMART, KZR-CAD-HR2, and CAMouflage NOW, one polymer-infiltrated ceramic network resin composite block, Enamic, along with Obsidian, a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic block, were characterized. Fracture toughness was determined through the notchless triangular prism specimen test, while flexural strength and flexural modulus were determined by three-point bend testing. Blocks were cut and ground to obtain (6 × 6 × 6 × 12) mm prisms and 10:1 span-to-thickness ratio bars (n = 25/group); half of the resin composite specimens were aged in 37°C distilled water for 30 days before testing. Fractured surfaces were characterized using a scanning electron microscope. Results were analyzed using Weibull statistics and two-way ANOVA, followed by Scheffé multiple means comparisons (α = 0.05). RESULTS: With regards to fracture toughness, KZR stood out among resin composites with a dry value of 1.37 MPa·m(1/2) ; this was significantly affected by ageing, while the fracture toughness of the other dispersed-fillers resin composite blocks was not. Obsidian had the highest fracture toughness at 1.47 MPa·m(1/2) . With regards to flexural strength, Obsidian > CERASMART = KZR > CAMouflage > Enamic. The flexural strength of the resin composites was lowered by ageing. Enamic was found to have the highest flexural modulus among the resin composites (33.02 GPa), but its value was significantly lower than that of Obsidian (76.46 GPa); flexural modulus was not affected by ageing. CONCLUSION: There was a significant difference in flexural strength between the materials, but not unanimously in flexural modulus and fracture toughness. The tested resin composite block materials had inferior flexural strength, flexural modulus and fracture toughness compared with the tested lithium disilicate glass-ceramic block (Obsidian). Enamic, the polymer infiltrated ceramic network material, had a significantly higher flexural modulus than the dispersed-fillers materials. Ageing had a deleterious impact on the flexural strength of all RCB, while its effect on the flexural modulus was insignificant. The selection of any restorative material requires a thorough analysis of its advantages and limitations to inform the clinical decision in a case-by-case approach.",2020,1,1,
374, Microstructural and Mechanical Characterization of CAD/CAM Materials for Monolithic Dental Restorations,"A. Furtado de Mendonca, M. Shahmoradi, C. V. D. Gouvêa, G. M. De Souza and A. Ellakwa", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To determine and compare the microstructure, flexural strength, flexural modulus, fracture strength, and microhardness of four types of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials for monolithic dental restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A lithium disilicate (LD; IPS e.max CAD), a zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS; VITA Suprinity), a hybrid high-performance polymer (HPP) composite resin (GC Cerasmart), and a hybrid polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material (VITA Enamic) were used to manufacture monolithic ceramic posterior crowns (n = 10) that were adhesively cemented on resin-based composite dies and loaded until fracture. In addition, 40 rectangular bars (n = 10) were milled and polished for three-point flexural strength testing. Microhardness (Vickers indentation), as well as quantitative (energy dispersive spectroscopy) and qualitative (scanning electron microscopy) structural analysis were conducted on fracture surfaces. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post-hoc test (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Mechanical testing results showed that the material type has a significant effect on the fracture strength (p < 0.0001) of the monolithic crowns with ZLS and LD presenting significantly higher fracture strength than the PICN and HPP hybrid materials. LD showed the highest flexural strength (p < 0.0001) followed by ZLS, HPP, and PICN, respectively. The lowest flexural modulus and hardness were presented by HPP whereas ZLS had the highest flexural modulus and hardness. The LD presented the highest modulus of resilience and the PICN the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: All CAD/CAM crown materials exhibited high values of fracture and flexural resistance, making them suitable materials for posterior full-crown restorations. Glass-ceramics suffered more from catastrophic and nonreparable fracture patterns, whereas minimal chipping and type II fracture patterns were more common in hybrid materials. The combination of more flexibility, less stiffness, and increased softness with satisfactory flexural and fracture strength values observed in PICN and HPP makes these two hybrid materials suitable choices for chairside monolithic crown fabrication.",2019,1,1,
32, An in vitro evaluation of the effect of polishing on the stainability of different CAD/CAM ceramic materials,"A. Abu-Obaid, A. AlMawash, N. Alyabis and N. Alzaaqi", Saudi Dent J," PURPOSE: To determine the effect of coffee on the stainability of CAD/CAM ceramics after different surface treatment protocols. METHODS: Ninety specimens (2 mm × 10 mm) of CAD/CAM ceramic materials (Vitablocs Mark II, VITA Enamic, and VITA Suprinity) were prepared. The specimens were subdivided (n = 10) into three groups: G1: Glazed (control group), G2: Subjected to finishing and polishing, and G3: Re-glazed after finishing and polishing. The surface treatment was performed using a diamond polishing system for porcelain (Diapol) followed by applying a diamond polishing paste (Diapolisher). The specimens were immersed in distilled water for 24 h, and the baseline color measurement after finishing and polishing was recorded. Each group was then immersed in a staining solution (coffee) for one week, and the second color measurement was recorded. RESULTS: The color of the CAD/CAM ceramic materials in the finishing and polishing groups changed significantly after staining (P < 0.05). Statistically significant differences were noticed after staining in the polished groups of Vita Enamic and Vita Suprinity compared with the glazed group (control). However, the color change between the re-glazed and control groups was insignificant for all the materials (P > 0.05). Although the color change values of the three CAD/CAM materials increased, these changes were within the clinically acceptable value (ΔE < 3.3). CONCLUSION: Staining of the tested CAD/CAM ceramic materials increased the color change values within the clinically acceptable range in all the groups, with the highest values found after finishing and polishing. Re-glazing is recommended after surface adjustment for all the tested materials to increase their resistance to staining.",2020,1,0,
250, Fracture strength of CAD/CAM composite and composite-ceramic occlusal veneers,"A. C. Johnson, A. Versluis, D. Tantbirojn and S. Ahuja", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: To determine the effect of material type and restoration thickness on the fracture strength of posterior occlusal veneers made from computer-milled composite (Paradigm MZ100) and composite-ceramic (Lava Ultimate) materials. METHODS: 60 maxillary molars were prepared and restored with CAD/CAM occlusal veneer restorations fabricated from either Paradigm MZ100 or Lava Ultimate blocks at minimal occlusal thicknesses of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0mm. Restorations were adhesively bonded and subjected to vertical compressive loading. The maximum force at fracture and mode of failure were recorded. 2-Way ANOVA was used to identify any statistically significant relationships between fracture strength and material type or thickness. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to analyze mode of failure with regard to fracture strength. RESULTS: The average maximum loads (N) at fracture for the Paradigm MZ100 groups were 1620 ± 433, 1830 ± 501, and 2027 ± 704 for the material thicknesses of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0mm, respectively. The Lava Ultimate groups fractured at slightly higher loads (N) of 2078 ± 605, 2141 ± 473, and 2115 ± 462 at the respective 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0mm thickness. Statistical analyses revealed that, while no significant difference existed among the various restoration thicknesses in terms of fracture strength (P>0.05), the material type was found to be influential (P=0.04). The maximum load at fracture (N) for Lava Ultimate averaged over all thicknesses (2111 ± 500) was significantly higher than that of the Paradigm MZ100 (1826 ± 564). No correlation between mode of failure and fracture strength was found. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, the maximal loads at fracture for these ""non-ceramic"" occlusal veneer restorations were found to be higher than human masticatory forces. Occlusal veneers made from the two materials tested are likely to survive occlusal forces regardless of restoration thickness, with those fabricated from the composite-ceramic hybrid material being more likely to survive heavier loads.",2014,1,1,
174," Effect of toothbrushing on the surface of enamel, direct and indirect CAD/CAM restorative materials","G. Nima, J. G. Lugo-Varillas, J. Soto, J. J. Faraoni, R. G. Palma-Dibb, A. Correa-Medina and M. Giannini", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To determine the effects of tooth brushing on the surface roughness (Sa) and morphology, maximum relative depth (Rv), gloss (GU), and microhardness (MH) of four esthetic restorative materials and enamel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A light-curing composite resin (Filtek Supreme Ultra [FSU], 3M ESPE), two hybrid resin/ceramic CAD/CAM materials (Lava Ultimate [LAV], 3M ESPE, and VITA Enamic [VEN], VITA Zahnfabrik), and a CAD/CAM feldspathic ceramic (VITA Blocs Mark II [VMA], VITA Zahnfabrik) were evaluated. Bovine enamel (ENA) was used as a control group. All surfaces were polished in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed before and after brushing (30,000 cycles) regarding Sa and Rv using a 3D laser-measuring microscope. GU was evaluated every 10,000 tooth brushing cycles. MH was also measured before and after tooth brushing. The surfaces were observed using scanning electron and laser measuring microscopies to determine the wear patterns. Data were analyzed by paired t test, one-way or two-way repeated measures analysis of variance, and Tukey test (α = .05), depending on the method performed. RESULTS: The Sa increased significantly after brushing for all materials, except for VMA, which showed the opposite effect. ENA and VEN showed higher Rv than VMA. After 30,000 tooth brushing cycles, VMA showed the highest GU, while FSU showed the lowest. Also, little surface topography changes were observed for VMA. MH did not change significantly after 30,000 brushing cycles, except for LAV. CONCLUSION: Brushing caused surface alterations in all tested materials except for feldspathic ceramic. The changes were more evident in resin-based materials.",2021,1,0,
288, In vivo wear determination of novel CAD/CAM ceramic crowns by using 3D alignment,"A. Aladağ, D. Oğuz, M. E. Çömlekoğlu and E. Akan", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To determine wear amount of single molar crowns, made from four different restoratives, and opposing natural teeth through computerized fabrication techniques using 3D image alignment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 single crowns (N = 24 patients, age range: 18 - 50) were made from lithium disilicate (IPS E-max CAD), lithium silicate and zirconia based (Vita Suprinity CAD), resin matrix ceramic material (Cerasmart, GC), and dual matrix (Vita Enamic CAD) blocks. After digital impressions (Cerec 3D Bluecam, DentsplySirona), the crowns were designed and manufactured (Cerec 3, DentsplySirona). A dual-curing resin cement was used for cementation (Variolink Esthetic DC, Ivoclar). Then, measurement and recording of crowns and the opposing enamel surfaces with the intraoral scanner were made as well as at the third and sixth month follow-ups. All measurements were superimposed with a software (David-Laserscanner, V3.10.4). Volume loss due to wear was calculated from baseline to follow-up periods with Siemens Unigraphics NX 10 software. Statistical analysis was accomplished by Repeated Measures for ANOVA (SPSS 21) at = .05 significance level. RESULTS: After 6 months, insignificant differences of the glass matrix and resin matrix materials for restoration/enamel wear were observed (P>.05). While there were no significant differences between the glass matrix groups (P>.05), significant differences between the resin matrix group materials (P<.05) were obtained. Although Cerasmart and Enamic were both resin matrix based, they exhibited different wear characteristics. CONCLUSION: Glass matrix materials showed less wear both on their own and opposing enamel surfaces than resin matrix ceramic materials.",2019,1,0,
87, Comparative Evaluation of the Internal and Marginal Adaptations of CAD/CAM Endocrowns and Crowns Fabricated from Three Different Materials,"M. Hasanzade, M. Sahebi, S. Zarrati, L. Payaminia and M. Alikhasi", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the internal and marginal adaptations of chairside CAD/CAM (CEREC) endocrowns and crowns fabricated from lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (VITA Suprinity), and hybrid ceramic (VITA Enamic). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dental models of the two first maxillary molars were selected. One was prepared for an endocrown, and the other for a standard all-ceramic crown. A total of 72 CAD/CAM restorations, including 36 endocrowns and 36 crowns made of IPS e.max CAD, VITA Suprinity, and VITA Enamic (n = 12 each), were fabricated. Discrepancies were measured in the buccal, mesial, lingual, and distal aspects of three sites (marginal, mid-axial wall, and occlusal/floor) using the noncontact ATOS scanner. Statistical analysis was performed using MANOVA and between-subject effects tests (α = .05). RESULTS: Mesial axial wall discrepancy was significantly lower in endocrowns compared to occlusal discrepancy in crowns, while distal axial wall discrepancy was significantly higher. Moreover, floor discrepancy was found to be significantly lower in endocrowns compared to crowns. However, type of material had no significant effect on any kind of discrepancy. CONCLUSION: The marginal and internal adaptation values were within a clinically acceptable range for both kinds of restoration and all three materials. However, restoration type (crown vs endocrown) was significantly different in the mesial and distal axial wall and occlusal/floor discrepancies, regardless of restoration material.",2021,1,0,
296, Influence of different cavity preparation designs on fracture resistance of onlay and overlay restorations using different CAD/CAM materials,"G. Ön Salman, H. Tacír Ɣ, Z. S. Polat and A. Salman", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate fracture strength of different preparation designed onlay and overlay restorations produced by Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and three different new ceramic-polymer blocks. METHODS: Ninety-one extracted human mandibular molars were used in this study. Preparations were made as (1) Only functional cusps reduction, (2) Only functional cusps reduction+rounded shoulder finish line, (3) All cusps reduction, or (4) All cusps reduction+rounded shoulder finish line. Then these four cavity types were restored with three different materials: VITA Enamic, GC Cerasmart, Lava Ultimate. Thirteen groups were created by added control group (n= 7). Adhesive cementation was achieved by using a dual cured composite resin adhesive cement RelyX Ultimate. All samples were subjected to thermocycling for 5,000 cycles in water baths between 50°C and 55°C. The fracture resistance of specimens was determined under compressive loads along the long axis of the restored teeth at 0.5 mm/minute crosshead speed until fracture with a universal test machine. Fracture types of restored groups were evaluated. For fracture resistance data, one-way ANOVA; for correlation between material type and preparation design, two-way ANOVA were used. Percentage table and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed for analysis of fracture types. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between all the groups (one-way ANOVA, P> 0.05). Group 4 showed statistically higher fracture strength values than Group 1 and no significant difference was found among other preparation designs by two-way ANOVA that compared all types of preparation designs regardless of material difference (P< 0.05). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the present study could help clinicians regarding which materials and type of preparations should be selected for onlay and overlay restorations produced with newly introduced ceramic-polymer CAD/CAM materials.",2017,1,0,
341," Luting of inlays, onlays, and overlays with preheated restorative composite resin does not prevent seating accuracy","P. Magne, M. Razaghy, M. A. Carvalho and L. M. Soares", Int J Esthet Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate in vitro the vertical seating of computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) composite resin inlays, onlays, and overlays luted with two different composite resins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty plastic typodont molars were prepared for medium-sized MOD inlays, anatomic onlays, and flat overlays (n = 20); 3-mm thick at the central groove with similar morphology (Cerec biogeneric copy). Restorations were milled using Lava Ultimate blocks, and included standardized hemispherical occlusal concavity for seating measurements with an electromechanic system (force = 30 N). Restorations were luted either with preheated composite resin (Filtek Z100) or dual-cure resin cement (RelyX Ultimate). Seating of restorations was first evaluated at try-in (baseline). Seating was reevaluated after airborne-particle abrasion (Step 1), after seating with luting agent (Step 2), and after light polymerization (Step 3). The Friedman test followed by the Wilcoxon post hoc test were used to compare the seating among steps, and the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney post hoc test were used to compare the seating between luting agents at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Seating differences varied significantly from baseline (P < 0.0125). All restorations seated 3.85 µm (inlays) to 5.45 µm (onlays) deeper after airborne-particle abrasion (Step 1) (P < 0.007). Except for cement-luted inlays, the try-in position (±1 µm) was recovered following unpolymerized luting (Step 2). After polymerization (Step 3), onlays and overlays seated 2.9 to 3.9 µm deeper than during try-in (baseline) using Z100 (P < 0.005), and 7.0 to 7.3 µm deeper using RelyX (P = 0.005). Inlays luted with RelyX seated higher than during try-in (baseline), exactly 7.9 µm after Step 2 (P = 0.005), and 7.7 µm after Step 3 (P = 0.008). Luting with Z100 sustained the seating of inlays with no statistical difference when compared to baseline (P = 0.157). CONCLUSION: Airborne-particle abrasion significantly deepens the seating of CAD/CAM composite resin restorations, but the presence of unpolymerized restorative composite resin luting agent perfectly compensates for this discrepancy. Following polymerization, onlays and overlays seat deeper compared to inlays, especially when using RelyX. The latter, however, resulted in a slightly higher seating of inlays. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: With the least variation compared to baseline seating (try-in), restorative composite resin used as luting agent resulted in the seating of CAD/CAM inlays, onlays, and overlays closer to baseline when compared to dual-cure resin cement.",2018,0,1,
480, Survival of resin infiltrated ceramics under influence of fatigue,M. N. Aboushelib and M. H. Elsafi, Dent Mater," PURPOSE: to evaluate influence of cyclic fatigue on two resin infiltrated ceramics and three all-ceramic crowns manufactured using CAD/CAM technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAD/CAM anatomically shaped crowns were manufactured using two resin infiltrated ceramics (Lava Ultimate and Vita Enamic), two reinforced glass ceramic milling blocks ((IPS)Empress CAD and (IPS)e.max CAD) and a veneered zirconia core ((IPS)Zir CAD). (IPS)e.max CAD and (IPS)Zir CAD were milled into 0.5mm thick anatomically shaped core structure which received standardized press-on veneer ceramic. The manufactured crowns were cemented on standardized resin dies using a resin adhesive (Panavia F2.0). Initial fracture strength of half of the specimens was calculated using one cycle load to failure in a universal testing machine. The remaining crowns were subjected to 3.7 million chewing cycles (load range 50-200N at 3s interval) in a custom made pneumatic fatigue tester. Survival statistics were calculated and Weibull modulus was measured from fitted load-cycle-failure diagrams. Scanning electron microscopy was performed to fractographically analyze fractured surfaces. Data were analyzed using two way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc tests (α=0.05). RESULTS: Dynamic fatigue resulted in significant reduction (F=7.54, P<0.005) of the initial fracture strength of the tested specimens. Zirconia showed the highest deterioration percent (34% reduction in strength) followed by (IPS)Empress (32.2%), (IPS)e.max (27.1%) while Lava Ultimate and Vita Enamic showed the lowest percent of reduction in strength. The two types of resin infiltrated ceramics and (IPS)Empress demonstrated the highest percent of fracture incidences under the influence of fatigue (35-45% splitting). None of the tested veneered zirconia restorations were fractured during testing, however, chipping of the veneer ceramics was observed in 6 crowns. The lowest percent of failure was observed for (IPS)e.max crowns manifested as 3 cases of minor chipping in addition to two complete fracture incidences. SEM images demonstrated the internal structure of the tested materials and detected location and size of the critical crack. CONCLUSION: The internal structure of the tested materials significantly influenced their fatigue behavior. Resin infiltrated ceramics were least influenced by fatigue while the characteristic strength of zirconia prevented core fracture but failure still occurred from the weaker veneer ceramic.",2016,1,0,
377, Microtensile bond strength and interfacial properties of self-etching and self-adhesive resin cements used to lute composite onlays under different seating forces,"C. Goracci, A. H. Cury, A. Cantoro, F. Papacchini, F. R. Tay and M. Ferrari", J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate strength and morphology of the interface created on enamel and dentin by Panavia F 2.0 (P, Kuraray), RelyX Unicem (RU, 3M ESPE), and Maxcem (M, Sybron-Kerr), applied under two standardized clinically realistic seating pressures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Composite overlays (Paradigm MZ100, 3M ESPE) were luted on flat enamel or dentin surfaces of 48 extracted molars. During the initial 5-min self-curing period, a pressure of either 20 or 40 g/mm(2) was maintained on the overlay. Curing was completed by light irradiation from the top of the overlay for 20 s. Microtensile sticks and specimens for SEM observations were obtained from the luted teeth. Bond strength data from enamel and dentin (MPa) were analyzed with separate two-way ANOVAs in order to assess the effect of cement type, luting pressure, and their interactions. Tukey's test was used for post-hoc comparisons (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: The bond strengths (MPa) to dentin were: P 20 g/mm(2) 7.5 +/- 3.7, 40 g/mm(2) 10.9 +/- 4.5; RU 20 g/mm(2) 6.8 +/- 2.6, 40 g/mm(2) 14.5 +/- 5.3; M 20 g/mm(2) 4.1 +/- 1.8, 40 g/mm(2) 5.2 +/- 1.6. The bond strengths (MPa) to enamel were: P 20 g/mm(2) 25.2 +/- 9.0, 40 g/mm(2) 30.7 +/- 8.6; RU 20 g/mm(2) 10.7 +/- 4.9, 40 g/mm(2) 11.1 +/- 5; M 20 g/mm(2) 7.3 +/- 3.1, 40 g/mm(2) 7.9 +/- .2. Cement type, luting pressure, and the interaction of these two factors had significant influences on dentin bond strength, with RU and P outperforming M. RU and P significantly benefited from the increase in luting pressure. In enamel, the type of cement was a significant factor for adhesion, with P yielding the highest and M the lowest strength. The measured bond strengths corresponded with the morphological results. CONCLUSION: Interfacial strength and adaptation of self-etching and self-adhesive dual-curing cements are enhanced if a seating force greater than finger pressure is maintained throughout the initial self-curing period.",2006,0,1,
129, Effect of dental restorative materials surface roughness on the in vitro biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans biofilm,"P. Contreras-Guerrero, M. Ortiz-Magdaleno, M. S. Urcuyo-Alvarado, J. A. Cepeda-Bravo, D. Leyva-Del Rio, J. E. Pérez-López, G. F. Romo-Ramírez and L. O. Sánchez-Vargas", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation over different restorative dental materials. METHODS: Using a bioreactor over 72 hours, four commercially available ceramics were evaluated: IPS E-max Press, IPS E-max CAD, Lava Ultimate CAD-CAM, Vita Enamic and two resin composites (SR Nexco Paste and Brilliant NG). The results were evaluated using atomic force microscopy and confocal microscopy, the biofilm was stained and the arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU) quantified. RESULTS: The results showed that IPS E-max CAD had the lowest roughness values (4.29±1.79 nm), while the highest values were observed for Vita Enamic discs ( (77.13±17.35 nm). Analysis of S. mutans biofilm formation by AFU revealed lower values for IPS E-max CAD (6.77±1.67 nm); the highest values were found for Lava Ultimate (79.99±22.23 nm). Regarding the composite groups, SR Nexco Paste showed roughness values of 15.07±2.77 nm and lower arbitrary fluorescence units of 30.92±12.01 nm than Brilliant NT. There was a correlation between the surface roughness of ceramics and composite with S. mutans biofilm formation. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The adhesion of oral bacteria to restorative dental materials plays a key role in the success of dental treatment; the surface roughness influences the S. mutans biofilm formation.",2020,1,0,
366, Mechanical stability of zirconia meso-abutments bonded to titanium bases restored with different monolithic all-ceramic crowns,"J. Pitta, S. P. Hicklin, V. Fehmer, J. Boldt, P. C. Gierthmuehlen and I. Sailer", Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants," PURPOSE: To evaluate the bending moments and failure modes of zirconia meso-abutments bonded to titanium bases restored with different monolithic all-ceramic crowns after aging, and to compare them to titanium abutments restored with all-ceramic crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight internal conical connection implants (Conelog, Camlog 4.3 mm diameter) were restored with four different computer-aided design/computed-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) abutment-crown combinations (n = 12). Thirty-six customized zirconia meso-abutments were bonded to titanium bases (Conelog Titanium Base CAD/CAM crown, Camlog) and divided into three groups according to the different crown materials: (T1) monolithic lithium-disilicate (e-max CAD, Ivoclar), (T2) monolithic PICN (polymer-infiltrated ceramic network [Enamic, Vita]), and (T3) monolithic zirconia (Lava Plus, 3M ESPE). Twelve titanium customized abutments restored with monolithic lithium-disilicate (e-max CAD, Ivoclar) crowns served as the control group (C). The crowns were equal maxillary central incisors and were adhesively bonded with a resin-based cement (Panavia 21, Kuraray). All samples were embedded in acrylic holders. After aging (1,200,000 cycles, 49 N, 1.67 Hz, 5°C to 50°C, 120 seconds), static load was applied until failure. Bending moments were calculated for comparison of the groups. Data were statistically treated with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test (P < .05). Failure modes were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: The means of the bending moments were 356.4 ± 20.8 Ncm (T1), 357.7 ± 26.3 Ncm (T2), 385.5 ± 21.2 Ncm (T3), and 358.8 ± 25.3 Ncm (C). Group T3 revealed significantly higher mean bending moments than the other groups (P < .05). No differences were found between zirconia meso-abutments supported by titanium bases and customized titanium abutments when lithium-disilicate crowns were used (P > .05). No failures were identified during and after aging. After static load, failures occurred due to fracture of the abutment in the internal connection in all the groups. CONCLUSION: Zirconia meso-abutments bonded to titanium bases showed similar mechanical stability compared with customized titanium abutments. Regarding the crown material, all three tested ceramics (lithium-disilicate, PICN, and zirconia) revealed very good stability when used in the monolithic state.",2019,1,0,
453, Shear Bond Strength of Repair Systems to New CAD/CAM Restorative Materials,"Ö. Üstün, I. K. Büyükhatipoğlu and A. Seçilmiş", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the bond strength of repair systems (Ceramic Repair, Clearfil Repair) to computer-aided design/computer-assisted machining (CAD/CAM) restorative materials (IPS e.max CAD, Vita Suprinity, Vita Enamic, Lava Ultimate). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thermally aged CAD/CAM restorative material specimens (5000 cycles between 5°C and 55°C) were randomly divided into two groups according to the repair system: Ceramic Repair (37% phosphoric acid + Monobond-S + Heliobond + Tetric N Ceram) or Clearfil Repair (40% phosphoric acid + mixture of Clearfil Porcelain Bond Activator and Clearfil SE Bond Primer + Clearfil SE Bond + Filtek Z250). The resin composite was light-cured on conditioned specimens. All specimens were stored in distilled water at 37°C for 24 hours and then additionally aged for 5000 thermal cycles. The shear bond strength test was performed using a universal testing machine (0.5 mm/min). Two-way ANOVA was used to detect significance differences according to the CAD/CAM material and composite repair system factors. Subgroup analyses were conducted using the least significant difference post-hoc test. RESULTS: The results of two-way ANOVA indicated that bond strength values varied according to the restorative materials (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the CAD/CAM restorative materials (p > 0.05), except in the Vita Suprinity group (p < 0.05). Moreover, no differences were observed between the repair systems. CONCLUSIONS: Both the Clearfil and Ceramic repair systems used in the study allow for successful repairs.",2018,0,0,
390, Monolithic Polymer-Infiltrated Ceramic Network CAD/CAM Single Crowns: Three-Year Mid-Term Results of a Prospective Clinical Study,"F. A. Spitznagel, K. J. Scholz, K. Vach and P. C. Gierthmuehlen", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of monolithic CAD/CAM-fabricated polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) single crowns (SC) after 3 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 34 patients who received 76 single crowns were included in this cohort study. Full-coverage crown preparation with reduced thickness (1.0 to 1.5 mm) was applied. All monolithic PICN SCs (VITA Enamic) were manufactured using a CAD/CAM system and adhesively seated. Clinical follow-up evaluations were performed at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after insertion using modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Kaplan-Meier survival and success methods were applied to calculate absolute and relative failures. To determine effects of time and restoration, a mixed logit model was adjusted for the modified USPHS criteria (P < .05). RESULTS: PICN SCs revealed an estimated Kaplan-Meier survival rate of 93.9% after 3 years. Four clinically unacceptable fractures occurred, which resulted in replacement of the affected SCs. Neither secondary caries nor debonding were recorded. The 3-year Kaplan-Meier success rate was 92.7%. Significant increases in marginal discoloration (P = .0002) and surface roughness (P < .0001) were noted over time. Color match, anatomical form, and marginal adaptation remained favorable over the given observation period. CONCLUSION: PICN CAD/CAM crowns with reduced thickness showed acceptable survival and success rates over a service time of 36 months. However, extended clinical follow-up periods are needed to evaluate the long-term performance.",2020,1,0,
118, Effect of Aging Regimens on Resin Nanoceramic Chairside CAD/CAM Material,"F. A. Al-Harbi, N. M. Ayad, A. S. ArRejaie, H. A. Bahgat and N. Z. Baba", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of cyclic mechanical loading, thermal cycling, and storage in water on a resin nanoceramic chairside computer-aided designed/computer-aided manufactured (CAD/CAM) material compared to a control leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty specimens (18 × 4 × 3 mm) were milled from two chairside CAD/CAM materials' blocks (Lava Ultimate: LU; Vitablock Mark II: VM). Each group included four subgroups (A: n = 20 control; B: n = 20 cyclic loading [105 cycles, 80 N]; C: n = 20 thermal cycling [5 to 55°C]; D: n = 60 water storage [20: 3 months; 20: 6 months; 20: 9 months at 37°C]). Each subgroup included 10 specimens tested for flexure strength using three-point bending in a universal testing machine. The other 10 specimens were tested for surface roughness using an automated profiler followed by testing for surface hardness using a microhardness tester. RESULTS: LU displayed higher flexure strength than VM before and after all the aging conditions. The surface roughness for VM was lower than LU for the control, but both materials showed comparable values and significant increases after 9 months storage in water. After cyclic loading, only VM displayed a significant increase in the surface roughness value (p < 0.05). The surface hardness of VM was higher than LU for the control. VM did not show significant changes in hardness after any aging condition. LU showed significant reduction in surface hardness value only after storage in water (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The resin nanoceramic Lava Ultimate can be used as a durable substitute for glass-ceramic chairside CAD/CAM material.",2017,1,0,
379, Microtensile Bond Strength Between Resin-Matrix CAD/CAM Ceramics and Resin Cement after Various Surface Modifications and Artificial Aging,"C. Papadopoulos, D. Dionysopoulos, K. Pahinis, E. Koulaouzidou and K. Tolidis", J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of different surface modification methods on the microtensile bond strength (μTBS) of four resin-matrix CAD/CAM ceramics after artificial aging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens of four CAD/CAM materials (Shofu Block HC, Lava Ultimate, Brilliant Crios, and Vita Enamic) were prepared and divided into four groups. Each group received one of the following treatments: group 1 (INT): no surface modification; group 2: sandblasting with 29-μm Al2O3 particles (SB); group 3: hydrofluoric acid etching (9%) + silane (HF+Si); group 4: sandblasting with 30-μm particles of the CoJet system (CJ). The specimens of each group were luted together in pairs using resin cement (RelyX Ultimate). After one week of water storage (37°C), the sandwich specimens were sectioned into rectangular microspecimens and half of them were immediately subjected to μTBS testing, while the other half was tested after six months. Data were statistically analyzed using FFANOVA including the factors of material, treatment, and storage time, with α = 0.05. RESULTS: After one week, the lowest μTBS was observed for INT, while the highest was found for either mechanical (SB and CJ) or chemical (HF+Si) treatments (p < 0.05). After six months, a significant decrease in μTBS was observed depending on treatment (p < 0.05), while artificial aging significantly influenced the μTBS of all experimental groups (p < 0.05). During the two storage periods, the failure type was mainly interfacial and was associated with the type of surface modification. CONCLUSION: After artificial aging, the μTBS appeared to depend on srface modification, while the parameter ""material"" did not influence the results. Consequently, adhesive strategies should be oriented towards surface modification techniques.",2021,1,0,
206, Evaluation of the Effect of Different Surface Treatments on Luting CAD/CAM Composite Resin Overlay Workpieces,"E. M. Kassotakis, M. Stavridakis, T. Bortolotto, S. Ardu and I. Krejci", J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on luting CAD/CAM composite resin workpieces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred eight (108) composite CAD/CAM block sections (Lava Ultimate) 3 mm in thickness were polished up to 4000 grit and then randomly assigned to 6 experimental groups according to the applied surface treatment (no treatment, sodium bicarbonate [NaHCO3], glycine, alumina [Al2O3], CoJet, and SilJet). After standardized sandblasting procedures, 2 block sections from each group were randomly chosen for the qualitative SEM evaluation of the sandblasted surfaces. The remaining 96 CAD/CAM block sections were luted in pairs using a bonding agent (Single Bond) and a restorative composite resin (Filtek Ultimate). Specimens were aged for 2 weeks in 37°C water with 3000 thermal cycles (5°C/55°C), the microtensile test was performed (n = 30), and the values were statistically analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test (p = 0.05). RESULTS: The qualitative SEM evaluation of the sandblasted surfaces showed that sodium bicarbonate and glycine had almost no conditioning effect on the CAD/CAM composite resin. In contrast, aluminum oxide, CoJet, and SilJet had a profound conditioning effect on the CAD/CAM composite resin. No treatment, sodium bicarbonate, and glycine specimens were debonded after thermal stressing (0 MPa), while aluminum oxide, CoJet, and SilJet showed high microtensile values (Al2O3: 104.45 ± 18.76 MPa; CoJet: 105.55 ± 11.88 MPa; SilJet: 105.02 ± 20.84 MPa), which were not statistically significantly different from each other.

497, The Effect of Surface Treatments on the Mechanical and Optical Behaviors of CAD/CAM Restorative Materials,"S. Kurtulmus-Yilmaz, E. Cengiz, S. Ongun and I. Karakaya", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on mechanical and optical properties of lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), 2 resin nanoceramics (Lava Ultimate, GC Cerasmart), and polymer-infiltrated ceramic network material (Vita Enamic). MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAD/CAM blocks were sectioned into 4 × 1 × 14 mm(3) bars for three-point bending test and 1 × 8 × 8 mm(3) square specimens were obtained for color and translucency measurements. Bar-shaped and square specimens were divided into five groups according to the surface treatment method as: control (no treatment), hydrofluoric acid etching, airborne-particle abrasion, 2 W and 3 W Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation (n = 10). Three-point bending test was carried out on a universal test machine with a 1 mm/min crosshead speed. Color and translucency measurements were performed with a spectrophotometer and repeated after surface treatments. Flexural strength, translucency parameter, and ΔE values were calculated and data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests. ΔE values >1.2 and >2.7 were considered as perceptible and unacceptable, respectively. RESULTS: All surface treatment methods decreased the flexural strength of all tested materials (P < 0.05) except for 2 W laser-irradiated and airborne-particle abraded Vita Enamic and 2 W laser irradiated Lava Ultimate (P > 0.05). Color changes of lithium disilicate specimens were not perceptible except for airborne-particle abraded specimens. All ΔE values of resin-based materials were above the perceptibility threshold. Acid-etched and 3 W laser-irradiated GC Vita Enamic specimens revealed unacceptable color changes. The translucencies of resin-based materials significantly decreased after all surface treatment applications. CONCLUSIONS: Surface treatments affected the flexural strength and optical properties of CAD/CAM restorative materials. Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation with 2 W energy level may be an alternative surface treatment method for CAD/CAM materials.",2019,1,0,
44, Bond strength of novel CAD/CAM restorative materials to self-adhesive resin cement: the effect of surface treatments,S. E. Elsaka, J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on the microtensile bond strength (μTBS) of novel CAD/CAM restorative materials to self-adhesive resin cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two types of CAD/CAM restorative materials (Vita Enamic [VE] and Lava Ultimate [LU]) were used. The specimens were divided into five groups in each test according to the surface treatment performed; Gr 1 (control; no treatment), Gr 2 (sandblasted [SB]), Gr 3 (SB+silane [S]), Gr 4 (hydrofluoric acid [HF]), and Gr 5 (HF+S). A dual-curing self-adhesive resin cement (Bifix SE [BF]) was applied to each group for testing the adhesion after 24 h of storage in distilled water or after 30 days using the μTBS test. Following fracture testing, specimens were examined with a stereomicroscope and SEM. Surface roughness and morphology of the CAD/CAM restorative materials were characterized after treatment. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test. RESULTS: The surface treatment, type of CAD/CAM restorative material, and water storage periods showed a significant effect on the μTBS (p<0.001). For the LU/BF system, there was no significant difference in the bond strength values between different surface treatments (p>0.05). On the other hand, for the VE/BF system, surface treatment with HF+S showed higher bond strength values compared with SB and HF surface treatments (p<0.05). Surface roughness and SEM analyses showed that the surface topography of CAD/CAM restorative materials was modified after treatments. CONCLUSION: The effect of surface treatments on the bond strength of novel CAD/CAM restorative materials to resin cement is material dependent.

Yucel, Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of different thicknesses of CAD-CAM ceramic sections on the polymerization of two different resin cements. METHODS: Three CAD-CAM all-ceramic restorative materials were sectioned with four different thicknesses. A total of 240 resin cement specimens were prepared from light cured and dual cure resin cements and absorption peaks were recorded. 10 samples of each resin cement were examined before and after polymerization and served as the control group. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, independent t- and Tukey HSD tests (P< 0.05). RESULTS: Control group showed the highest DOC values while samples cured under Vita Enamic section with a thickness of 2 mm presented the lowest values (P< 0.05). Polymerization performed under sections of 0.5 and 1 mm thicknesses provided statistically higher values. Dual cured resin cement samples showed higher DOC values compared to light cured resin cement samples. IPS Empress CAD sections with 0.5 and 1 mm thickness exhibited statistically higher values than other ceramics of the same thickness for light cured resin cement samples. A significant difference was observed between IPS Empress CAD and Vita Enamic while comparing ceramic sections of the same thickness (P< 0.05). There was no difference for sections of 1.5 and 2 mm (P>> 0.05). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Thickness of the restorative material for an indirect restoration is a key element to determine the type of resin cement.",2019,1,0,
29, Adhesive luting to hybrid ceramic and resin composite CAD/CAM Blocks:Er:YAG Laser versus chemical etching and micro-abrasion pretreatment,"H. M. El-Damanhoury, A. E. N, S. Sheela and M. D. Gaintantzopoulou", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of Er:YAG laser on the roughness, surface topography, and bond strength to resin luting cement based on chemical and micro-abrasion pretreatments of different computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing materials. METHODS: A polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network (PICN) material (Vita Enamic, VE), three indirect resin composite (Cerasmart, CS; Shofu HC, SH; Lava Ultimate, LU), and one lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max CAD, EM) blocks were subjected to one of the following pretreatments: no treatment (NC ), Er:YAG etching with one of two powers (either 3 or 6 W), hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching, self-etching ceramic primer (ME), or micro-abrasion (MA). The shear bond strength (SBS) of resin luting cement to pretreated materials was tested. Surface roughness was measured via atomic force microscopy, and surface topography was analyzed via scanning electron microscopy. Two-way analysis of variance, Tukey post-hoc test, and Pearson correlation were applied. RESULTS: Etching EM and VE with HF or the ME resulted in the highest SBS values in their groups (P < 0.05). LU, SH, VE, and CS indicated similar SBS values when treated with 3 W, 6 W, and MA. The highest surface roughness (Sa ) values were obtained for the LU, CS, and VE groups when treated with 6 W, whereas the lowest Sa values were obtained for CS when treated with the ME and EM when treated with the ME or 3 W. Only SH and CS indicated a significant correlation between surface rough ness and bond strength. CONCLUSIONS: Er:YAG laser etching is comparable to micro-abrasion when treating resin composite blocks and may induce fewer surface cracks. HF etching remains the gold standard for the treatment of glass-based ceramics and PICNs.",2021,1,1,
65, Changes in Optical Characteristics and Surface Topography of CAD/CAM Materials after Bleaching Applications: An AFM Evaluation,I. Karakaya and E. Cengiz-Yanardag, J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of in-office and at-home bleaching agents on color changes (ΔE(00) ), translucency (TP(00) ), whiteness (WI(D) ), surface roughness (R(a) ), and surface topography (R(sk) and R(ku) ) of a resin nano-ceramic and a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network CAD/CAM material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty specimens (6 mm × 7 mm × 1.3 mm) were prepared from Lava Ultimate (LU) and Vita Enamic (VE). The specimens were divided into 6 groups according to the bleaching agents applied (n = 10/group): control, Perfect Bleach Office + (PBO), Opalescence Boost (OB), Perfect Bleach (PB) with 10% and 16% carbamide peroxide and Whiteness Perfect (WP). ΔE(00) values were calculated before and after bleaching procedures with a spectrophotometer using the CIEDE2000 formula. ΔTP(00) and ΔWI(D) values were calculated for each material. R(a) , R(sk) , and R(ku) values of the specimens were evaluated with an Atomic Force Microscope. Two-way ANOVA was used for statistical analyses of the parameters measured after bleaching. For pairwise comparisons, Tukey test was performed. RESULTS: For LU, no statistically significant difference among the ΔE(00) values of the groups was observed (p = 1.000). For VE, only WP group presented significantly higher values (2.12 ± 2.66) than the other groups (p < 0.001). For both materials; ΔTP(00) values of at-home bleaching groups were significantly higher than in-office bleaching groups and control group (p < 0.001). For VE, ΔWI(D) values did not demonstrate statistically significant difference (p = 1.000); however, for LU, PBO applied group showed statistically higher ΔWI(D) values (3.00 ± 2.38) (p = 0.010) and WP applied group showed lower ΔWI(D) values (0.47 ± 0.31) than the other groups (p = 0.030). For both LU and VE, there was no statistically significant difference among the groups regarding Ra (F = 4.544), R(sk) (F = 2.369), and R(ku) values (F = 2.391) (p = 1.000). All of the VE groups presented R(a) values higher than 0.2 µm. CONCLUSIONS: The optical properties of LU and VE after bleaching applications were affected by the contact time with bleaching agents rather than concentration. Bleaching procedure had no effect on the surface properties of these materials.",2020,1,0,
496, The effect of sandblasting duration on the bond durability of dual-cure adhesive cement to CAD/CAM resin restoratives,"N. Tekçe, S. Tuncer and M. Demirci", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of prolonged sandblasting on the bond durability of dual-cure adhesive resin cement to computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) restoratives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nano-ceramic LAVA Ultimate and hybrid-ceramic VITA Enamic CAD/CAM blocks were used for this study. Each CAD/CAM block was sectioned into slabs of 4-mm thickness for the microtensile test (µTBS) test and 2-mm thickness for the surface roughness test. Three groups were created according to the sandblasting protocols; group 1: specimens were sandblasted for 15 seconds, group 2: specimens were sandblasted for 30 seconds, and group 3: specimens were sandblasted for 60 seconds. After sandblasting, all specimens were luted using RelyX Ultimate Clicker. Half the specimens were subjected to µTBS tests at 24 hours, and the other half were subjected to tests after 5000 thermocycles. Additionally, a total of 96 CAD/CAM block sections were prepared for surface roughness tests and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluations. The Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, and Dunn's post hoc test were used to compare continuous variables among the groups. RESULTS: At baseline, group 1, group 2, and group 3 exhibited statistically similar µTBS results for LAVA. However, group 3 had significantly lower µTBS values than groups 1 and 2 for VITA. After 5000 thermocycles, µTBS values significantly decreased for each block (P<.05). CONCLUSION: It is important to perform controlled sandblasting because it may affect bond strength results. Sixty seconds of sandblasting disturbs the initial µTBS values and the stability of adhesion of CAD/CAM restoratives to dual-cure adhesive resin cement for VITA Enamic.",2018,1,0,
425, Repair Bond Strength of a CAD/CAM Nanoceramic Resin and Direct Composite Resin: Effect of Aging and Surface Conditioning Methods,"D. M. D. Moura, A. M. O. Dal Piva, A. Januário, A. H. Verissímo, M. A. Bottino, M. Özcan and R. O. A. Souza", J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of surface conditioning methods and aging on the repair bond strength between resin composite and nanoceramic CAD/CAM resin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four blocks of nanoceramic CAD/CAM resin (NCR) (Lava Ultimate, 3M Oral Care) (10 x 5 x 2 mm3) and resin composite (Filtek Z350, 3M Oral Care) (RC) were made, embedded in acrylic resin, polished (#600, #800, #1200) and randomly divided into 8 groups (n = 12 each) according to surface conditioning methods (air abrasion with 30-μm CoJet [CJ] or air abrasion with 50-μm Al2O3 [AB]) and aging prior to repair (without aging, 24 h in water at 37°C; with aging 6 months in water at 37°C). The blocks were air abraded (20 s, 2.5 bar, 10 mm) using a standardized device. A layer of adhesive resin (Scotchbond Universal) was applied (20 s) and photopolymerized for 20 s. RC cylinders (Ø = 2 mm; h = 2 mm) were then bonded to the NCR substrates using a Teflon matrix and photopolymerized for 40 s. All specimens were thermocycled (10,000 cycles, 5°C-55°C) and submitted to the shear bond test (50 kgf, 0.5 mm/min) to measure repair strength. Data (MPa) were analyzed using 3-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05). Failure analysis was performed using stereomicroscopy (20X). RESULTS: ANOVA revealed a significant effect of only the ""material"" factor (p = 0.00). The group NCR6mCJ presented bond strengths (29.37 ± 5.41) which were significantly higher than those of the NCR24hCJ (20.88 ± 5.74) and RC groups (p < 0.05). The group RC24hCJ (19.71 ± 4.21) presented the lowest shear bond strength (p < 0.05). Failure analysis revealed predominantly type B mixed failures (adhesive+cohesive in the substrate material) except for the groups NCR24hCJ and NCR6mAB, where mainly type C failure (adhesive+cohesive at the RC) was observed. CONCLUSION: Air abrasion with Al2O3 particles or silicatization with CoJet followed by adhesive resin application are effective surface conditioning methods for the repair of nanoceramic CAD/CAM resin with resin composite.",2020,1,1,
164, Effect of Surface Treatment and Aging on Bond Strength of Composite Cement to Novel CAD/CAM Nanohybrid Composite,S. E. Elsaka and A. M. Elnaghy, J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of surface treatments and aging on the bond strength of composite cement to a novel CAD/CAM nanohybrid composite. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microtensile bond strength (µTBS) of a dual-curing composite cement (Bifix QM; BQ) to three CAD/CAM restorative materials (Grandio [GR], Vita Enamic [VE], and Lava Ultimate [LU]) was evaluated after different surface treatments. The surfaces of specimens received the following treatments: control (no treatment), sandblasting (SB), SB + silane (Ceramic Bond; CB), hydrofluoric acid (HF), HF + CB, TiF4 2 wt/v%, TiF4 2 wt/v% + CB, TiF4 4 wt/v%, and TiF4 4 wt/v% + CB. Half of the specimens in each group were aged. Surface topography and surface roughness were evaluated. Statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA and Tukey's test. The Weibull analysis was conducted on µTBS data of aged groups. RESULTS: The µTBS was significantly affected by the type of CAD/CAM material, type of treatment, and aging (p < 0.001). Silane application significantly improved the µTBS (p < 0.05). The µTBS decreased significantly with aging (5000 thermocycles) (p < 0.05). BQ cement resulted in the highest μTBS to GR treated with TiF4 2% wt/v + CB compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). Aged GR/BQ treated with TiF4 2% wt/v + CB had the highest predicted µTBS (19 MPa). CONCLUSION: TiF4 2% wt/v followed by silane application enhanced the adhesion of GR/BQ and LU/BQ systems. On the other hand, HF surface treatment followed by silane application improved the adhesion of the VE/BQ system.",2020,0,1,
171, Effect of thermocycling on the surface properties of resin-matrix CAD-CAM ceramics after different surface treatments,"G. Çakmak, M. G. Subaşı and B. Yilmaz", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of thermocycling on the water contact angle (WCA), surface roughness (SR), and microhardness (MH) of resin-matrix computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM) ceramics after different surface treatments (conventional polishing or 2 different surface sealants). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two different types of resin-matrix CAD-CAM ceramics; a nanoparticle-filled resin (CeraSmart; CS) and a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate; LU) were tested. Rectangular-shaped plates (1 mm-thick) were divided into 3 groups (n = 8) in terms of surface treatment methods applied: conventional polishing (control) or 2 surface sealants (Optiglaze (OG) and Palaseal (PS)). Scanning electron microscope images ( × 1000 and × 700 magnifications) of each material were taken from 2 additional specimens before surface treatments. After surface treatments, WCAs of deionized water, SR, and MH values of specimens were measured. All specimens were subjected to 5000 thermocycling and measurements were repeated. SR, WCA, and MH data before and after thermocycling were compared by using a 2-way ANOVA (α=.05). RESULTS: A significant interaction was found between the surface treatment and the material for WCA after thermocycling (P < .001), for SR before thermocycling (P = .014), and for MH both before and after thermocycling (P < .001). SEM images before surface treatments revealed that the surface of CS was mechanically rougher with a more microretentive topography compared with the surface of LU. No significant correlation was found between SR and WCA (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Thermocycling affected the SR, MH, and WCA of all resin-matrix CAD-CAM ceramics.",2021,1,0,
143, Effect of Home Bleaching Agents on Color Stability and Surface Roughness of Hybrid Ceramics: An in vitro study,S. Ünver and A. Z. Yildirim, Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of two different home bleaching agents on the color stability and surface roughness of hybrid ceramics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three dental hybrid ceramics (Lava Ultimate, CeraSmart, and Vita Enamic) and two different home bleaching agents (hydrogen peroxide [9.5%; HP] and carbamide peroxide [22%; CP]) were used. Thirty specimens with dimensions of 12 x 14 x 1 mm were prepared for each material. Technical polishing kits were applied to one surface of the specimens for the surface finishing procedure. The color parameters (L*a*b*) of specimens were measured. Three subgroups for each ceramic were determined: control (C), HP, and CP (n = 10 each). After bleaching procedures, the color parameters were remeasured, and color differences (ΔE) were calculated. The surface roughness values of the specimens were detected using a profilometer. Surface analysis was performed with a scanning electron microscope on one specimen from each group. Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and Tukey honest significant difference tests. RESULTS: There was an interaction between material and bleaching agent type (P < .05). The highest ΔE values were observed in the CP groups, and the lowest ΔE values were observed in the C groups. For surface roughness, there was no interaction between material and bleaching agent type (P > .05). Material and bleaching agent factors had a significant effect on surface roughness (P Δ .05). The highest surface roughness values were detected in the HP groups. CONCLUSION: Home bleaching agents caused clinically acceptable color differences on hybrid ceramic materials. HP increased the surface roughness of hybrid ceramics.",2021,1,0,
301, Influence of different surface treatments on bond strength of novel CAD/CAM restorative materials to resin cement,"M. B. Kömürcüoğlu, E. Sağırkaya and A. Tulga", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of different surface treatments on the bond strength of novel CAD/CAM restorative materials to resin cement by four point bending test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CAD/CAM materials under investigation were e.max CAD, Mark II, Lava Ultimate, and Enamic. A total of 400 bar specimens (4×1.2×12 mm) (n=10) milled from the CAD/CAM blocks underwent various pretreatments (no pretreatment (C), hydrofluoric acid (A), hydrofluoric acid + universal adhesive (Scotchbond) (AS), sandblasting (Sb), and sandblasting + universal adhesive (SbS)). The bars were luted end-to-end on the prepared surfaces with a dual curing adhesive resin cement (Variolink N, Ivoclar Vivadent) on the custom-made stainless steel mold. Ten test specimens for each treatment and material combination were performed with four point bending test method. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test. RESULTS: The surface treatment and type of CAD/CAM restorative material showed a significant effect on the four point bending strength (FPBS) (P<.001). For LDC, AS surface treatment showed the highest FPBS results (100.31 ± 10.7 MPa) and the lowest values were obtained in RNC (23.63 ± 9.0 MPa) for control group. SEM analyses showed that the surface topography of CAD/CAM restorative materials was modified after treatments. CONCLUSION: The surface treatment of sandblasting or HF acid etching in combination with a universal adhesive containing MDP can be suggested for the adhesive cementation of the novel CAD/CAM restorative materials.",2017,0,0,
187, Effects of Simulated Gastric Juice on CAD/CAM Resin Composites-Morphological and Mechanical Evaluations,"A. D. Backer, E. A. Münchow, G. J. Eckert, A. T. Hara, J. A. Platt and M. C. Bottino", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of simulated gastric juice on CAD/CAM resin composites by means of morphological and mechanical (i.e., hardness) evaluations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen specimens of each resin composite (Lava Ultimate and Paradigm MZ100) were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. They were submitted to erosive challenges in a simulated gastric juice (pH = 1.2) solution for 6 and 24 hours. Vickers microhardness and surface roughness (R(a) , R(q) ) evaluations were taken before (baseline) and after acid exposure. Morphological analysis was obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls's test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Paradigm MZ100 demonstrated higher microhardness than Lava Ultimate regardless of the storage time period (p ≤ 0.001), and microhardness was not affected by the acidic challenge (p = 0.58). After 6 hours of acid exposure, a significant decrease in R(a) and R(q) was seen for Paradigm MZ100 when compared to the baseline (R(a) p = 0.032; R(q) p = 0.013); however, for Lava Ultimate only Rq decreased (p = 0.021), while R(a) remained unchanged (p = 0.38). After 24 hours of acid exposure, while Paradigm MZ100 exhibited no additional changes in surface roughness (p ≥ 0.75), Lava Ultimate became rougher (R(a) p = 0.041; R(q) p = 0.014), as confirmed by SEM imaging. CONCLUSIONS: The acidic scenario tested in the present study changed the surface roughness of the resin composites but not their Vickers microhardness. Moreover, both resin composites seem suitable for use under acidic scenarios, although Paradigm MZ100 showed enhanced stability compared to Lava Ultimate.",2017,0,1,
221, Fatigue resistance and failure mode of adhesively restored custom metal-composite resin premolar implant abutments,"L. L. Boff, E. Oderich, A. C. Cardoso and P. Magne", Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants," PURPOSE: To evaluate the fatigue resistance and failure mode of composite resin and porcelain onlays and crowns bonded to premolar custom metal-composite resin premolar implant abutments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty composite resin mesostructures were fabricated with computer assistance with two preparation designs (crown vs onlay) and bonded to a metal implant abutment. Following insertion into an implant with a tapered abutment interface (Titamax CM), each metal-composite resin abutment was restored with either composite resin (Paradigm MZ100) or ceramic (Paradigm C) (n = 15) and attached with adhesive resin (Optibond FL) and a preheated light-curing composite resin (Filtek Z100). Cyclic isometric chewing (5 Hz) was then simulated, starting with 5,000 cycles at a load of 50 N, followed by stages of 200, 400, 600, 800, 1,000, 1,200, and 1,400 N (25,000 cycles each). Samples were loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 180,000 cycles. The four groups were compared using life table survival analysis (log-rank test). Previously published data using zirconia abutments of the same design were included for comparison. RESULTS: Paradigm C and MZ100 specimens fractured at average loads of 1,133 N and 1,266 N, respectively. Survival rates ranged from 20% to 33.3% (ceramic crowns and onlays) to 60% (composite resin crowns and onlays) and were significantly different (pooled data for restorative material). There were no restoration failures, but there were adhesive failures at the connection between the abutment and the mesostructure. The survival of the metal-composite resin premolar abutments was inferior to that of identical zirconia abutments from a previous study (pooled data for abutment material). CONCLUSIONS: Composite resin onlays/crowns bonded to metal-composite resin premolar implant abutments presented higher survival rates than comparable ceramic onlays/crowns. Zirconia abutments outperformed the metal-composite resin premolar abutments.",2014,0,1,
54, CAD/CAM post-and-core using different esthetic materials: Fracture resistance and bond strengths,"D. R. Falcão Spina, R. Goulart da Costa, I. C. Farias, L. G. da Cunha, A. V. Ritter, C. C. Gonzaga and G. M. Correr", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the fracture resistance (FR), and push-out bond strengths (BS) of custom-made CAD/CAM post-and-cores manufactured with different esthetic materials. METHODS: 90 single-rooted extracted teeth were selected, endodontically treated and prepared to receive the posts. The specimens were randomly divided into three equal groups according to the material: hybrid ceramic Vita Enamic (HC); nano-ceramic resin composite Lava Ultimate (RC); and experimental epoxy-resin reinforced by glass-fiber (FG). The post-and-cores were manufactured using CAD/CAM and cemented using a self-adhesive resin cement (Rely X Unicem2). A subgroup of 30 specimens (n=10) was subjected to fatigue (1,000,000 cycles at 5 Hz) and then to the FR test. Another subgroup with 60 specimens was submitted to the BS test, with and without fatigue. Data were submitted to analysis of variance (FR - one-way ANOVA; BS - two-way ANOVA) and Tukey's test (α= 0.05). RESULTS: The FR values (mean±SD, in Newtons) were 414.5±83.9 (HC), 621.3±100.3 (RC), and 407.6±109.0 (FG), with RC showing significantly higher FR values (P< 0.05). For BS, there was no statistically significant difference among the materials, with and without fatigue (P> 0.05). The type of material used to obtain the CAD/CAM-customized post-and-cores had a significant effect on the FR, but not on the BS of the specimens. Fatigue did not influence the BS for the tested materials. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: CAD/CAM custom-made esthetic post-and-cores showed good performance relative to fracture resistance and bond strength to root canal dentin walls. The CAD/CAM materials tested could be used as an alternative to restore wide flared root canals in esthetically compromised teeth.",2017,1,1,
146," Effect of Inlays, Onlays and Endocrown Cavity Design Preparation on Fracture Resistance and Fracture Mode of Endodontically Treated Teeth: An In Vitro Study","C. Kassis, P. Khoury, C. Z. Mehanna, N. Z. Baba, F. Bou Chebel, M. Daou and L. Hardan", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the fracture resistance and failure modes of endodontically treated mandibular molars restored with different designs of inlays, onlays and endocrowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracted mandibular third molars (n = 180) were used. An access cavity was prepared on the occlusal surface of each tooth and the roots were obturated with gutta percha. All specimens were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 30/group) according to the cavity design and the restoration material used. C: control group without access cavity preparation. IE: MOD inlay preparation with EverX Posterior (GC Europe) in the pulp chamber. IG: MOD inlay preparation with G-aenial Universal Flo (GC America) in the pulp chamber. OE: onlay preparation with EverX Posterior (GC Europe) in the pulp chamber. OG: onlay preparation with G-aenial Universal Flo (GC America) in the pulp chamber. EC: endocrown with an empty pulp chamber. All restorations were fabricated with CAD/CAM system using CERASMART(®) (GC Dental products Europe, Belgium) CAD/CAM blocks. Specimens were thermal-cycled and were subjected to a compressive load applied at 30° angle relative to the long axis of the tooth with a universal testing machine. Results were statistically analyzed by ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc tests. Chi-square test and Fisher Exact tests were used for the comparisons among groups. RESULTS: The mean fracture strength was significantly different between the groups (p < 0.001); it was significantly highest for intact teeth, followed by endocrowns (p = 0.021). The strength was significantly lower for inlays (with G-aenial Universal Flo and EverX Posterior), intermediate for onlays with EverX Posterior followed by onlays with G-aenial Universal Flo. CONCLUSIONS: Endocrowns exhibited higher fracture resistance than other tested composite resin groups. Endocrowns and onlays showed a more favorable failure mode than inlay restorations.",2021,0,0,
133, Effect of different fiber-reinforced solutions on fracture strength and pattern of endodontically treated molars,"R. Michelotto Tempesta, C. M. Saratti, G. T. Rocca, D. Pasqualini, M. Alovisi, A. Baldi, A. Comba and N. Scotti", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the fracture strength of endodontically treated molars filled with different composite resins, with or without fiber reinforcement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 intact mandibular molars were selected and endodontically treated. A standardized mesio-occlusal-distal cavity was prepared with cervical margins 1 mm above the cementoenamel junction and oral and buccal walls with 1.5-mm remaining thickness. Universal adhesive was used in all specimens in etch-and-rinse mode. Specimens were divided into four groups (n = 15 each) according to restoration technique: CSM group, adhesive overlay with hybrid ceramic (CeraSmart, GC); EXP group, direct composite restoration (Essentia U, GC) and everX Posterior (GC) as core material; ESU group, direct composite restoration (Essentia U); and EST group, direct composite restoration (Essentia U) reinforced with horizontal bidirectional glass fibers placed over the pulpal chamber floor (everStick-Net, GC). After 7 days of water storage, samples were loaded until fracture using a universal testing machine. The maximum breaking loads were recorded in Newtons (N), and statistical analysis was then conducted with two-way analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey test. Fragments were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Mean fracture resistance was: CSM = 1,428.9 ± 316.90 N; EXP = 1,874.57 ± 299.47; ESU = 1,557.44 ± 355.65; and EST = 1,870.27 ± 145.11. CSM and EXP showed the highest strength values when compared to the other groups. The variable ""fiber insertion"" did not significantly alter the fracture resistance. Origins of the fractures were always located on the occlusal surface, mainly from the major contact loading area. CONCLUSION: The use of everX Posterior showed great improvement in fracture resistance, similar to cuspal coverage restoration. However, only short fiber-reinforced composite resins showed a favorable fracture pattern.",2021,1,0,
380, Microtensile bond strength evaluation of self-adhesive resin cement to zirconia ceramic after different pre-treatments,"A. Casucci, C. Goracci, N. Chieffi, F. Monticelli, A. Giovannetti, J. Juloski and M. Ferrari", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of different surface treatments and metal primer application on bond strength of zirconia ceramic to a self-adhesive resin cement. METHODS: 40 cylinder-shaped (Ø 12 x 5.25 mm high) of zirconia ceramic (Aadva Zirconia) were randomly divided into four groups (n= 10), based on the surface treatment to be performed: (1) Sandblasting with 125 microm Al2O3 particles (S) (positive control); (2) Selective infiltration etching (SIE); (3) Experimental heated etching solution applied for 30 minutes (ST); (4) No treatment (C). Half of the zirconia specimens of each group received the application of Metal Primer II. Eight disks for each group were luted using a self-adhesive resin cement (G-Cem Automix) to composite overlays (Paradigm MZ100). After 24-hour storage (37 degrees C, 100% RH) bonded specimens were cut into microtensile sticks and loaded in tension until failure. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Games-Howell (P < 0.05). Failure mode distribution was recorded and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the fractured microbars. The remaining cylinders of each group (n = 2) were used for SEM surface analysis. RESULTS: Both surface treatments and Metal Primer II application improved bond strength values (P < 0.05). When Metal Primer II was not applied ST treatment achieved highest bond strength values (22.17 +/- 10.37 MPa). Sandblasting in combination with Metal Primer II enhanced bond strength values compared to the other groups (23.46 +/- 11.19 MPa).",2012,0,1,
46, Bonding Effectiveness of Luting Composites to Different CAD/CAM Materials,"M. Peumans, E. B. Valjakova, J. De Munck, C. B. Mishevska and B. Van Meerbeek", J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of different surface treatments of six novel CAD/CAM materials on the bonding effectiveness of two luting composites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six different CAD/CAM materials were tested: four ceramics - Vita Mark II; IPS Empress CAD and IPS e.max CAD; Celtra Duo - one hybrid ceramic, Vita Enamic, and one composite CAD/CAM block, Lava Ultimate. A total of 60 blocks (10 per material) received various mechanical surface treatments: 1. 600-grit SiC paper; 2. sandblasting with 30-μm Al2O3; 3. tribochemical silica coating (CoJet). Subsequent chemical surface treatments involved either no further treatment (control), HF acid etching (HF), silanization (S, or HF acid etching followed by silanization (HF+S). Two specimens with the same surface treatment were bonded together using two dual-curing luting composites: Clearfil Esthetic Cement (self-etching) or Panavia SA Cement (self-adhesive). After 1 week of water storage, the microtensile bond strength of the sectioned microspecimens was measured and the failure mode was evaluated. RESULTS: The bonding performance of the six CAD/CAM materials was significantly influenced by surface treatment (linear mixed models, p < 0.05). The luting cement had a significant influence on bond strength for Celtra Duo and Lava Ultimate (linear mixed models, p < 0.05). Mechanical surface treatment significantly influenced the bond strength for Celtra Duo (p = 0.0117), IPS e.max CAD (p = 0.0115), and Lava Ultimate (p < 0.0001). Different chemical surface treatments resulted in the highest bond strengths for the six CAD/CAM materials: Vita Mark II and IPS Empress CAD: S, HF+S; Celtra Duo: HF, HF+S; IPS e.max CAD: HF+S; Vita Enamic: HF+S, S. For Lava Ultimate, the highest bond strengths were obtained with HF, S, HF+S. Failure analysis showed a relation between bond strength and failure type: more mixed failures were observed with higher bond strengths. Mainly adhesive failures were noticed if no further surface treatment was done. The percentage of adhesive failures was higher for CAD/CAM materials with higher flexural strength (Celtra Duo, IPS e.max CAD, and Lava Ultimate). CONCLUSION: The bond strength of luting composites to novel CAD/CAM materials is influenced by surface treatment. For each luting composite, an adhesive cementation protocol can be specified in order to obtain the highest bond to the individual CAD/CAM materials.",2016,1,1,
337, Light Transmission of Novel CAD/CAM Materials and Their Influence on the Degree of Conversion of a Dual-curing Resin Cement,"F. Egilmez, G. Ergun, I. Cekic-Nagas, P. K. Vallittu and L. V. Lassila", J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the light transmission characteristics of different types, shades, and thicknesses of novel CAD/CAM materials and their effect on the degree of conversion (DC) of a dual-curing resin cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Square specimens (12 × 12 mm2) of three CAD/CAM materials - GC Cerasmart, Lava Ultimate, Vita Enamic - of different thicknesses (1.00, 1.50, and 2.00 mm, n = 5 per thickness) were irradiated with an LED unit. The amount of transmitted light was quantified. Thereafter, the DC% of the dual-curing resin cement (RelyX Ultimate) was recorded after 15 min using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey's HSD post-hoc test at a significance level of p < 0.05. Regression analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between the DC and radiant energy, and the DC and thickness. RESULTS: Although the type and shade of CAD/CAM material significantly affect transmitted light irradiation (p < 0.0001), degrees of conversion are similar when the CAD/CAM material or material shade were taken into consideration (p > 0.05). Conversely, material thickness significantly affected light transmission (p < 0.0001) and DC (p < 0.0001). Multiple effects of material, shade, and thickness did not significantly affect the evaluated parameters (p = 0.638 for light irradiation; p = 0.637 for DC). Linear regression analysis showed a correlation between delivered energy and DC% results of the Vita Enamic (R² = 0.4169, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Reduced light transmission in 2-mm-thick specimens of all CAD/CAM materials indicates that proper curing of the cement beneath CAD/CAM materials should be ensured.",2017,0,0,
58," Cement Thickness of Inlay Restorations Made of Lithium Disilicate, Polymer-Infiltrated Ceramic and Nano-Ceramic CAD/CAM Materials Evaluated Using 3D X-Ray Micro-Computed Tomography","R. Uzgur, E. Ercan, Z. Uzgur, H. Çolak, M. Yalçın and M. Özcan", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the marginal and internal cement thicknesses of inlay restorations made of various CAD/CAM materials using 3D X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Caries-free extracted mandibular molars (N = 30) with similar size were randomly assigned to three groups (N = 10 per group). Mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) cavities were prepared, and inlay restorations were obtained by milling out CAD/CAM materials namely, (a) IPS: monolithic lithium disilicate (control), (b) VE: polymer-infiltrated ceramic, and (c) CS: nano-ceramic using a CAM unit. Marginal and internal cement thicknesses were measured using 3D micro-CT. Data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: The mean marginal and internal cement thickness were not significant in all inlay materials (p > 0.05). Mean marginal cement thickness (μm) was the lowest for the IPS group (67.54 ± 10.16) followed by VE (84.09 ± 3.94) and CS (95.18 ± 10.58) (p > 0.05). The internal cement thickness (μm) was the lowest in the CS group (54.85 ± 6.94) followed by IPS (60.58 ± 9.22) and VE (77.53 ± 12.13) (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Marginal and internal cement thicknesses of MOD inlays made of monolithic lithium disilicate, polymer-infiltrated ceramic, and nano-ceramic CAD/CAM materials were similar and all less than 100 μm, which could be considered clinically acceptable. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: MOD inlays made of different CAD/CAM materials presented similar cement thickness, less than 100 μm.",2018,1,0,
351, Marginal Fit Comparison of CAD/CAM Crowns Milled from Two Different Materials,"A. Azarbal, M. Azarbal, R. L. Engelmeier and T. C. Kunkel", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To evaluate the marginal fit of CAD/CAM copings milled from hybrid ceramic (Vita Enamic) blocks and lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD) blocks, and to evaluate the effect of crystallization firing on the marginal fit of lithium disilicate copings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A standardized metal die with a 1-mm-wide shoulder finish line was imaged using the CEREC AC Bluecam. The coping was designed using CEREC 3 software. The design was used to fabricate 15 lithium disilicate and 15 hybrid ceramic copings. Design and milling were accomplished by one operator. The copings were seated on the metal die using a pressure clamp with a uniform pressure of 5.5 lbs. A Macroview Microscope (14×) was used for direct viewing of the marginal gap. Four areas were imaged on each coping (buccal, distal, lingual, mesial). Image analysis software was used to measure the marginal gaps in μm at 15 randomly selected points on each of the four surfaces. A total of 60 measurements were made per specimen. For lithium disilicate copings the measurements for marginal gap were made before and after crystallization firing. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The overall mean difference in marginal gap between the hybrid ceramic and crystallized lithium disilicate copings was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Greater mean marginal gaps were measured for crystallized lithium disilicate copings. The overall mean difference in marginal gap before and after firing (precrystallized and crystallized lithium disilicate copings) showed an average of 62 μm increase in marginal gap after firing. This difference was also significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A significant difference exists in the marginal gap discrepancy when comparing hybrid ceramic and lithium disilicate CAD/CAM crowns. Also crystallization firing can result in a significant increase in the marginal gap of lithium disilicate CAD/CAM crowns.",2018,1,0,
147, Effect of light-curing time on microhardness of a restorative bulk-fill resin composite to lute CAD-CAM resin composite endocrowns,"R. Daher, S. Ardu, C. J. Kleverlaan, E. DiBella, A. J. Feilzer and I. Krejci", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To evaluate the minimal irradiation time to reach a sufficient polymerization of a photopolymerizable restorative bulk-fill resin composite to lute endocrowns. METHODS: A photopolymerizable restorative bulk-fill resin composite (Filtek One Bulk Fill) was submitted to direct light-curing by a high power LED light-curing unit for 20 seconds as the positive control group (n = 10). Five more test groups (n= 10) were light-cured in a natural tooth mold from three sites (buccal, palatal and occlusal) under a 9.5 mm thick nanohybrid resin composite CAD-CAM endocrown (Lava Ultimate A2 LT), for different irradiation times: 90 seconds per site, 40 seconds per site, 30 seconds per site, 20 seconds per site and 10 seconds per site. Vickers microhardness measurements were made at two different depths and test/control ratios were calculated. Ratios of 0.8 were considered as an adequate level of curing. RESULTS: Analysis shows that 30 seconds x 3 was the minimal irradiation time that presented a test/control ratio above 0.8. Quantile regressions showed that the required irradiation time to reach a test/control ratio of 0.8 at a confidence level of 95% was 38 seconds and 37 seconds for 200 µm and 500 µm, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between microhardness of the two depths except for the irradiation time of 10 seconds. A 120-second (40 seconds per buccal, palatal and occlusal site) light-curing of photopolymerizable bulk-fill resin composite to lute a resin composite CAD-CAM endocrown restoration can be considered sufficient to reach adequate polymerization.",2020,0,1,
165, Effect of surface treatment and cement type on dentin bonding of processed resin composite,"A. V. Ritter, T. A. Sulaiman, B. M. Rodgers, F. Baratto-Filho, L. Cunha, C. C. Gonzaga and G. M. Correr", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To examine the effect of surface treatment and cement type on dentin bonding of processed resin composite restorations. METHODS: Bovine incisors were sectioned to expose mid-dentin, and randomly assigned to four different groups: Group ULT, Lava Ultimate composite blocks were bonded to dentin with RelyX Ultimate; Group ULT-CJ was treated as in Group ULT but CoJet was used to treat the intaglio surface prior to bonding; Group UNC was bonded with RelyX Unicem 2; and Group UNC-CJ was treated as in Group UNC but CoJet was used to treat the intaglio surface. RelyX Unicem 2 was used as a self-adhesive resin cement, while RelyX Ultimate was used as an adhesive resin cement with Scotchbond Universal. All adhesives and resin composites were polymerized with a high-irradiance LED polymerizing light (Elipar DeepCure-S). After bonding, all specimens were kept in 100% humidity and 37°C for 7 days and then processed for microtensile bond strength (µTBS) testing (n=15). The failure mode was analyzed under SEM as cohesive, adhesive, or mixed. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test (α=0.05). RESULTS: Mean µTBS values ranged from 8.83 MPa (±3.13 MPa) for UNC to 25.63 MPa (±5.94 MPa) for ULT-CJ. Means were statistically significantly higher for the adhesive cement when compared with the self-adhesive cement (P< 0.05), and, for the adhesive cement, CoJet resulted in statistically significantly higher means (P< 0.05). The number of pre-test failures was uniform across groups (n=2-4). Failures were predominantly adhesive and mixed. The adhesive resin cement RelyX Ultimate performed significantly better than the self-adhesive resin cement RelyX Unicem 2, and surface treatment with CoJet improved bond strengths of Lava Ultimate to dentin. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: CoJet treatment and adhesive resin cements should be used when bonding laboratory/CAD-CAM processed resin composite restorations to dentin.",2019,0,1,
439, Restoration's thickness and bonding tooth substrate are determining factors in minimally invasive adhesive dentistry,"G. T. Rocca, B. Baldrich, C. M. Saratti, L. M. Delgado, M. Roig, R. Daher and I. Krejci", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: To explore fracture strength and failure behaviour of minimally invasive CAD-CAM composite resin overlay restorations. METHODS: Eighty bi- and tri-layer cylindrical overlay model including the restoration bonded over bovine tooth dentin (Groups D) and enamel-dentin (Groups E) were assembled (diameter 9 mm). Restorations were milled from CAD-CAM composite resin blocks (Brilliant Crios, Coltène/Whaledent AG) in different thicknesses (0.5mm, 1mm, 1.5mm, 2mm) and equally distributed in four Groups D and four Groups E (n=10). All specimens were submitted to an Hertzian load-to-failure contact test with spherical indenter. Critical loads were recorded in Newton and data were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple and Mann-Whitney test for 2-samples comparisons (p < 0.05). Fragments were examined using SEM. The stress distribution for specimens with restorations of 0.5 mm and 2 mm was also investigated with FEA. RESULTS: For all specimens, the mean static loads in Newton increased with an increase in restoration thickness. On contrary, restorations with the same thickness displayed higher resistance values when bonded over enamel than dentin, except for the 2-mm thick restorations. A damage competition was detected between cone/median cracks originating at the loading contact area of the restorations and radial cracks beginning at their inner surface, with the former prevailing in restorations bonded on enamel and the latter being dominant for restorations bonded on dentin. CONCLUSIONS: For bonded ultra-thin resin composite restorations (0.5 mm to 1.5 mm) enamel as bonding substrate assures higher critical loads to fracture than dentin. This influence gradually decreases as restoration thickened.",2021,0,1,
429, Repair bond strengths of non-aged and aged resin nanoceramics,M. G. Subaşı and G. Alp, J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To explore the influence of different surface conditionings on surface changes and the influence of surface treatments and aging on the bond strengths of composites to non-aged and aged resin nanoceramics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rectangular-shaped non-aged and aged (5000 thermocycles) resin nanoceramic specimens (Lava Ultimate) (n=63, each) were divided into 3 groups according to surface treatments (untreated, air abrasion, or silica coating) (n=21). The surface roughness was measured and scanning electron microscopy was used to examine one specimen from each group. Afterwards, the specimens were repaired with a composite resin (Filtek Z550) and half were sent for aging (5000 thermocycles, n=10, each). Shear bond strengths and failure types were evaluated. Roughness and bond strength were investigated by two- and three-way analysis of variance, respectively. The correlation between the roughness and bond strength was investigated by Pearson's correlation test. RESULTS: Surface-treated samples had higher roughness compared with the untreated specimens (P=.000). For the non-aged resin nanoceramic groups, aging was a significant factor for bond strength; for the aged resin nanoceramic groups, surface treatment and aging were significant factors. The failures were mostly adhesive after thermal cycling, except in the non-aged untreated group and the aged air-abraded group, which had mostly mixed failures. Roughness and bond strength were positively correlated (P=.003). CONCLUSION: Surface treatment is not required for the repair of non-aged resin nanoceramic; for the repair of aged resin nanoceramic restorations, air abrasion is recommended.",2017,1,0,
190, Effects of various polishing techniques and thermal cycling on the surface roughness and color change of polymer-based CAD/CAM materials,B. Acar and F. Egilmez, Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To investigate and compare the effects of several polishing systems and thermal cycling on the surface roughness and color change of various polymer-based CAD/CAM materials. METHODS: Bar-shaped specimens (GC CeraSmart, CS; Lava Ultimate, LU and Vita Enamic, VE) were prepared. All specimens were polished with SiC papers. The specimens in Group A served as control and no additional surface polishing was applied. Final polishing was performed using diamond polishing paste (Diapolisher Paste) in Group B. In Group C, aluminum oxide abrasive discs (Sof-Lex XT Pop on) were used. Group D was polished with diamond impregnated spiral polishing system (EVE Diacomp Plus Twist). In Group E, polishing was done with rubber-based silicon abrasives (Polydentia). Thereafter, the specimens were submitted to thermal cycling. The surface roughness and color measurements were performed. Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney U tests were applied for the evaluation of ΔE₀₀ data. Ra data were evaluated using three-way ANOVA. Pearson's correlation between Ra and ΔE₀₀ was further investigated. RESULTS: Neither the CAD/CAM materials nor thermal cycling affected the Ra data (P> 0.05). In contrast, significant difference was found among the polishing methods (P< 0.001). On the other hand, VE showed the highest color change whereas LU showed the lowest (P< 0.05). Additionally, the specimens in Group D exhibited significantly higher color change than other tested groups (P< 0.05). A moderate positive correlation was seen between Ra and ΔE₀₀ data of LU (rho = 0.390, P= 0.01). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The diamond impregnated two-stage polishing procedure may not be an appropriate method for the tested CAD/CAM materials, as it resulted in the highest color change. On the other hand, all tested materials exhibited visually perceptible, but clinically acceptable color changes following the different polishing techniques. Additionally, diamond paste polishing could be a clinically acceptable procedure in terms of surface roughness.",2018,0,0,
282, In Vitro Evaluation of Translucency and Color Stability of CAD/CAM Polymer-Infiltrated Ceramic Materials after Accelerated Aging,"M. D. Al Amri, N. Labban, S. Alhijji, H. Alamri, M. Iskandar and J. A. Platt", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate and compare the translucency and color stability of a newly introduced polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material (Crystal Ultra) to those of clinically well-established restorative materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 80 specimens measuring (12 × 14 × 1 mm ± 0.05 mm) were prepared from five CAD/CAM (IPS e.max (IPS), Lava Ultimate (LU), Cerasmart (CS), Vita Enamic (VE), Crystal Ultra (CU)) high translucency (HT) blocks in A2 or equivalent shades. Specimens were randomly allocated into two groups (A and B) (n = 8), and were subjected to 5,000 thermal-cycles (TC). This was followed by one-week immersion of group A specimens in coffee (staining) solution and group B specimens in distilled water. Following immersion, the specimens from both groups were further subjected to 5,000 TC. A spectrophotometer was used to measure the translucency parameter (TP) and color change (ΔE(00) ) of the samples using CIELAB color coordinates at baseline, after 5,000 TC, following immersion, and after further 5,000 TC. Color stability was evaluated using the CIEDE2000 formula. Data were analyzed by non-parametric tests (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The TP values of the CAD/CAM materials ranged from 18.0-22.0. Following the initial TC, the changes in TP values were significant for VE (p = 0.012). Coffee immersion and further TC significantly impacted the TP values of PICN (VE and CU) materials compared to glass- ceramics (IPS), and resin nanoceramic (CS and LU) materials (p = 0.012). The comparison between CAD/CAM materials at different intervals showed a significant difference in the TP values (p < 0.01). The materials showed perceptible color changes following the initial TC except for PICN materials which demonstrated acceptable color changes. The major color difference was noticed for the resin nanoceramic specimens immersed in coffee; LU and CS showed higher color changes (ΔE(00) = 2.45 and 2.09, respectively) than VE and CU (ΔE(00) < 1.8). CONCLUSIONS: The translucency of the newly introduced Crystal Ultra PICN material was low compared to the resin nanoceramics and lithium disilicate glass-ceramic. The Crystal Ultra material exhibited better color stability compared to resin nanoceramics, but higher color change when compared with Vita Enamic PICN and lithium disilicate glass-ceramic CAD/CAM materials.",2021,1,0,
388, Monitoring fatigue damage in different CAD/CAM materials: A new approach with optical coherence tomography,"M. A. Schlenz, M. Skroch, A. Schmidt, P. Rehmann and B. Wöstmann", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: To investigate fatigue damage over time, monolithic posterior computer-aided-designed/computer-aided-manufactured (CAD/CAM) crowns were artificially aged in a mouth-motion-simulator, and damage was monitored with optical coherence tomography (OCT). METHODS: Forty-eight crowns were milled of six different CAD/CAM-materials (n=8), including 3Y-TZP (Lava Plus,'3Y'), 4Y-PSZ (Pritidentamultidisc,'4Y'), 5Y-PSZ (Prettauanterior,'5Y'), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (CeltraDuo,'ZLS'), hybrid ceramic (Vita Enamic,'VE'),and resin composite (BrilliantCrios,'COM'), and were adhesively luted on CAD/CAM-milled human molars. Specimens were artificially aged in a mouth-motion-simulator (50-500N, 2Hz, 37°C) for a period of 1 million cycles. Before loading and every 250,000 cycles, the specimens were investigated with spectral domain (SD)-OCT (RS-3000). The maximum vertical and horizontal damage were measured with imaging-processing-software (ImageJ). After testing, the specimens were sliced and analysed via light microscope (Zeiss) to compare the new OCT method with the established light microscope method. Data were subjected to ANCOVA and 2x4-ANOVA. RESULTS: No failure occurred during mouth-motion-simulation. However, all specimens (except for 3Y and 4Y) showed fatigue damage. There was a significant difference in the maximum damage between the CAD/CAM-materials (p<.05). ZLS exhibited the highest damage, followed by VE, COM and 5Y. While damage associated with 5Y was initially noticed after 750,000 cycles, all other materials already showed crack formation after 250,000 cycles. Furthermore, a linear increase in damage over time was noticed in all materials. Due to the shallow light penetration of OCT, damage in the outer area could only be visualized with light microscope. CONCLUSIONS: OCT is feasible for monitoring fatigue damage over time within different CAD/CAM-materials, particularly for subsurface damages.",2021,1,1,
230, Food solutions and cigarette smoke-dependent changes in color and surface texture of CAD/CAM resin composites - an in vitro study,"M. Reymus, A. Liebermann, S. Spintzyk and B. Stawarczyk", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the discoloration and surface properties of four CAD/CAM composite resins provoked by a variety of food solutions and cigarette smoke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 74 specimens (N = 370) were prepared per material (Brilliant Crios [Coltene], CeraSmart [GC], Lava Ultimate [3M Espe], Shofu Block HC [Shofu], and SonicFill 2 [Kerr]). Discoloration (ΔE) was investigated with a spectrophotometer. Measurements were taken before immersion in the storage media for 2 weeks (carrot juice, curry, cigarette smoke, red wine, energy drink, and distilled water), immediately after immersion, and after manual polishing of the specimens following immersion. The mean surface roughness (Ra) was measured using a profilometer. Qualitative surface observation was performed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc tests. RESULTS: The highest influence on ΔE after immersion was observed by the storage medium (η(P). = 0.878, P < .001), followed by the interaction between storage medium and material (η(P). = 0.770, P < .001) and the material (η(P). = 0.306, P < .001). For ΔE after polishing, the highest influence was indicated by the interaction of material and medium (η(P). = 0.554, P < .001), followed by the medium (η(P). = 0.244, P < .001) and the material (η(P). = 0.196, P < .001). Immersion in carrot juice led to the highest color change (ΔE: 8.0 to 10.4), whereas the lowest values were recorded in distilled water (ΔE: 2.0 to 2.4). Carrot juice and the energy drink provoked the highest Ra values (0.120 to 0.355 μm). SEM pictures indicated a loss of the organic matrix after manual polishing. CONCLUSION: The different materials reacted dissimilarly in the various storage media in terms of discoloration. Surface roughness increased after immersion and polishing. Neither discoloration nor surface roughness could be reset to default by manual polishing.",2021,0,1,
191, Efficacy of a Universal Adhesive in the Bond Strength of Composite Cements to Polymer-infiltrated Ceramic,"N. Rohr, A. Flury and J. Fischer", J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of a universal adhesive on the bond strength of composite cements to a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Shear bond strength to a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (Vita Enamic) and to its polymer and ceramic components was assessed on polished surfaces using either a conventional dual-curing resin (RelyX Ultimate) or self-adhesive composite cement (RelyX Unicem 2 Automix). Substrate surfaces were either not pretreated or a silane coupling agent (Vitasil), a universal adhesive (Scotchbond Universal Adhesive), or both were applied. Further, the shear bond strength to polymer-infiltrated ceramic network was evaluated after etching with 5% hydrofluoric acid (Vita Ceramics Etch) of 0, 15, 30, 60 or 120 s without or with application of silane, universal adhesive, or both (n = 10). Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) followed by post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: No bond (0 MPa) was formed to the polished polymer-infiltrated ceramic network or to its components for either cement. Application of silane resulted in low mean bond strengths (4 to 5 MPa) to the ceramic. The universal adhesive bonded mainly to the polymer part of the polymer-infiltrated ceramic network. The best bonding performance for both cements was achieved when silane and universal adhesive were applied on the polymer-infiltrated ceramic network. Etching for 30 s or 60 s resulted in the highest mean shear bond strengths for all pretreatment groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The best bonding performance of the self-adhesive dual-curing composite cement RelyX Unicem 2 Automix was found on the HF-etched polymer-infiltrated ceramic network. The conventional dual-curing composite cement RelyX Ultimate with Scotchbond Universal Adhesive may bond chemically to the polymer part of the polymer-infiltrated ceramic network. To achieve the highest bond strengths for both cements, the polymer-infiltrated ceramic network should be etched for 30 to 60 s, followed by the application of silane and universal adhesive.",2017,1,0,
492, The effect of glazing and aging on the surface properties of CAD/CAM resin blocks,"N. Tekçe, S. Fidan, S. Tuncer, D. Kara and M. Demirci", J Adv Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of accelerated aging on surface properties of glazed CAD/CAM resin blocks using a 2D surface profilometer and a 3D non-contact optical profilometer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three types of CAD/CAM resin restorative materials, LAVA Ultimate (3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA), VITA Enamic (Vita Zahnfabrik H. Rauter, Bad Säckingen, Germany), and Cerasmart (GC Corparation, Tokyo, Japan) were used for this study. CAD/CAM blocks were cut in 3-mm thickness slabs and divided into three groups; Group 1: control group (specimens polished with 600 grit SCI paper); Group 2: specimens sandblasted, silanized, and glazed with Optiglaze Color (GC); Group 3: glazed specimens subjected to 5000 thermocycles (n=15). The surface roughness (R(a) and R(z)) was evaluated using a profilometer and a 3D scanning instrument. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test (P<.05). RESULTS: LAVA, VITA, and Cerasmart exhibited statistically similar R(a) and R(z) values for each group (P>.05). For VITA and Cerasmart, the specimens in Group 1 exhibited significantly higher R(a) values than Group 2 (P<.05). Group 1 (0.502 R(a)), Group 2 (0.384 R(a)), and Group 3 (0.431 R(a)) exhibited statistically similar R(a) values for LAVA (P=.062). After 5000 thermocycles, surface roughness values did not change significantly for glazed LAVA, VITA, and Cerasmart (P>.05). CONCLUSION: Glaze material Optiglaze Color makes CAD/CAM resin surfaces smooth and glazed CAD/CAM surfaces seem resistant to deterioration under 5000 thermocycles.",2018,0,0,
382, Microtensile Bond Strength of CAD/CAM Resin Blocks to Dual-Cure Adhesive Cement: The Effect of Different Sandblasting Procedures,"N. Tekçe, S. Tuncer, M. Demirci, D. Kara and C. Baydemir", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of sandblasting powder particles on microtensile bond strength (μTBS) of dual-cure adhesive cement to CAD/CAM blocks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAD/CAM blocks (Cerasmart, VITA, and LAVA) were cut in slabs and divided into groups: group 1, no sandblasting; group 2, sandblasted with 27-μm Al(2) O(3) ; group 3, sandblasted with 30-μm CoJet; group 4, sandblasted with 50-μm Al(2) O(3) . After sandblasting, all specimens were silanized and luted using dual-cure adhesive cement (G-CEM LinkForce). After 24 hours, bonded specimens were cut into 1 ± 0.2 mm(2) sticks, and μTBS values were obtained (N = 30). Additionally, 132 CAD/CAM block sections were prepared for surface roughness testing and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluations. Results were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis One-way ANOVA and Dunn's Post Hoc Test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Group 1 exhibited significantly lower μTBS than the other groups (p < 0.05). The highest bond strength values were obtained from group 4 (p > 0.05). For LAVA, μTBS values of specimens that were sandblasted with 50-μm Al(2) O(3) powder were significantly higher than 30-μm-SiO(2) and 27-μm Al(2) O(3) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The sand particles investigated (27-μm Al(2) O(3) , 30-μm SiO(2) , or 50-μm Al(2) O(3) ) did not significantly affect μTBS results of CAD/CAM blocks for Cerasmart and VITA, although the results changed significantly for LAVA. The ideal bond protocol for CAD/CAM blocks is specific to the material used.",2019,0,0,
295, Influence of dentin and enamel on the fracture resistance of restorations at several thicknesses,"P. de Kok, C. J. Kleverland, R. H. Kuijs, M. A. Öztoprak and A. J. Feilzer", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of substrate and thickness on the fracture resistance of bonded dental restorative materials. METHODS: Cylindrical restorations (d = 4.0 mm) of resin composites Filtek Supreme XTE, Clearfil AP-X, Lava Ultimate and glass-ceramic IPS e.max CAD were fabricated at thicknesses of 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm and 2.0 mm respectively (n = 10 per group) and adhesively bonded to bovine enamel or dentin. The load to failure (LtF in N) of all specimens was determined in a universal testing machine and two one-way ANOVAs with a post hoc LSD tests and separate independent samples t-tests, performed at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: At 0.5 and 1.0 mm, direct resin composites bonded to dentin showed a higher LtF than when bonded to enamel, while the indirect materials showed reversed results (P< 0.05). At 2.0 mm there was no difference except for LU. A direct relationship between LtF and increasing thicknesses on enamel was found, while on dentin the LtF of direct resin composite restorations was less dependent on the thickness. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: For restorations up to 1 mm thickness, a substrate with a matching elastic modulus has a positive effect on the fracture resistance of glass-ceramics and resin composite restorations. When bonded to enamel, restoration thickness plays an important role in the fracture resistance. When bonded to dentin, thickness only affects the fracture resistance of indirect restoratives.",2018,0,1,
25," Adhesion, Mechanical Properties, and Microstructure of Resin-matrix CAD-CAM Ceramics","E. F. Castro, V. L. B. Azevedo, G. Nima, O. S. Andrade, C. Dias and M. Giannini", J Adhes Dent," PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of 1-year water storage and surface treatments on shear bond strength (SBS) of two composite cements bonded to resin matrix CAD-CAM ceramics (RMCs) and on the mechanical properties of RMCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three types of RMCs were tested: 1. polymer-infiltrated hybrid ceramic (PIHC, Enamic, VITA Zahnfabrik); 2. resin nanoceramic (RNC, Lava Ultimate, 3M Oral Care); and 3. flexible hybrid ceramic (FHC, Cerasmart, GC). One indirect laboratory composite (ILC, Epricord, Kuraray Noritake) was used as control. For each material, 60 plates (14 x 7 x 1 mm) were prepared for the SBS test and submitted to three different surface treatments: following manufacturer's instructions, non-thermal atmospheric plasma application (30 s), and plasma + bonding agent. Two composite cements were tested: RelyX Ultimate (3M Oral Care) and Panavia V5 (Kurarary Noritake). Two resin cylinders (1.5 mm diameter x 1.5 mm height) were bonded to each plate (n = 10), with one tested after 24-h storage in distilled water and the other after 1 year of storage in distilled water. Twenty rectangular bars (12 x 2 x 1 mm) of each indirect material were prepared and submitted to the 3-point flexural test after 24-h or 1-year water storage to determine the elastic modulus (EM) and flexural strength (FS) (n = 10). Fractured samples were also examined with SEM and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). SBS data were analyzed by four-way ANOVA, and EM and FS data by two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post-hoc test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Groups treated in accordance with manufacturer's instructions exhibited higher SBS than did plasma and plasma + bonding agent groups for all indirect materials, composite cements, and storage periods tested. In general, RelyX Ultimate displayed higher mean SBS than did Panavia V5, except for some groups of ILC where manufacturer's instructions were followed. After 1-year storage in water, all groups exhibited a significant reduction in SBS, except for some groups that following manufacturer's instructions. ILC showed the lowest values of EM and FS. Among the CAD-CAM materials, FHC exhibited the lowest EM and highest FS means, while PIHC possessed the highest EM and lowest FS means for both storage periods. CONCLUSIONS: In general, following the respective manufacturer's instructions yielded the best bond strength results. For most materials, 1-year water storage decreased bond strength of composite cements to RMCs, as well as their FS, while increasing their EM. Microstructure and composition influenced the mechanical properties studied.",2020,1,0,
385, Microtensile Bond Strength of Self-Adhesive Resin Cements to CAD/CAM Resin-Matrix Ceramics Prepared with Different Surface Treatments,E. Bayazıt, Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of different combinations of self-adhesive resin cements and surface treatments on the microtensile bond strength (μTBS) of different CAD/CAM resin-matrix ceramics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different types of CAD/CAM resin-matrix ceramics (LAVA Ultimate [LU] and Vita Enamic [VE]) were used. Slices 5 mm in thickness were obtained from each CAD/CAM material. Samples of each ceramic were randomly separated into the following surface treatment groups: (1) Control group with no surface treatment; (2) 9.5% hydrofluoric acid (HF) + universal adhesive (UA, Single Bond Universal, 3M ESPE); and (3) Sandblasting with 50-μm aluminum oxide particles (SN) + UA. Two different types of recently developed resin cement (RelyX U200, 3M ESPE; SET PP, SDI Dental Limited) were applied to the treated ceramic slices in each group. After 24 hours, parallel sections were removed from the specimens, and microbeam-shaped sticks (1.0 × 1.0 × 10 mm) were prepared. The μTBS test was performed, and the data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed differences among the study groups (P < .05). The control groups of each resin cement exhibited lower μTBS values than the groups that received surface treatment (P < .05). The effect of surface treatment on μTBS (partial eta-squared [ηp(2)] = 0.381) was more significant than the effects of ceramic (ηp(2) = 0.267) and self-adhesive resin cement (ηp(2) = 0.184). CONCLUSION: Surface treatment is the most important factor affecting the μTBS of resin cement to CAD/CAM materials, followed by the type of resin-matrix ceramic and the type of resin cement, respectively.",2019,1,0,
501, The Effects of Various Polishing Procedures on Surface Topography of CAD/CAM Resin Restoratives,"D. Kara, N. Tekçe, S. Fidan, M. Demirci, S. Tuncer and S. Balcı", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of different polishing procedures on surface properties of CAD/CAM resin blocks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, three different CAD/CAM restorative materials (Cerasmart, Lava Ultimate and Shofu Block HC) were used. CAD/CAM blocks were cut in 3-mm-thick slabs and divided into 5 groups. Group-1: Glaze; Group-2: Two-step Diamond Polisher; Group-3: One-step Diamond Polisher; Group-4: Three-step Diamond Polisher; Group-5: Polishing Discs+Diamond Paste. After polishing, top surfaces of the samples were prepared to screen by noncontact laser profilometer (Nanovea) for measurements. Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The arithmetical mean deviation of the profile was defined as Ra. The extension of Ra (a line's arithmetical mean height) to a surface was defined as Sa. Compared to the arithmetical mean of the surface, Sa expresses the difference in terms of each point's height as an absolute value. Sa was commonly used to assess surface roughness. The highest surface roughness (Ra) values in this study were 0.313 ± 0.05 for Cerasmart, 0.433 ± 0.10 for Lava Ultimate and 0.320 ± 0.05 for Shofu Block HC. The specimens in Group-4 displayed higher Ra values than other groups for each CAD/CAM material. According to surface topography (Sa) values, highest values were 2.936 ± 1.25 for Cerasmart, 2.633 ± 1.28 for Lava Ultimate and 3.489 ± 0.57 for Shofu Block HC. For Cerasmart, LAVA Ultimate and Shofu blocks, Group-1 exhibited significantly higher Sa values than other groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Optiglaze Color, Sof-Lex Diamond and Identoflex Diamond Ceramic Polisher create smooth CAD/CAM resin surfaces. However, surface roughness values of Cosmedent Nano/Microhybrid Diamond and Diapolisher Paste applied specimens were high. According to Sa values, highest roughness values belong to Optiglaze Color.",2021,0,0,
137, Effect of Different Surface Treatments on Bond Strength of Resin Cement to a CAD/CAM Restorative Material,"K. Barutcigil, Ç. Barutcigil, E. Kul, M. M. Özarslan and U. S. Buyukkaplan", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of various surface treatment methods on the shear bond strength of self-adhesive resin cement to a novel CAD/CAM hybrid ceramic material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel hybrid ceramic restorative material (Vita Enamic) was used in this study. Sixty resin block specimens were prepared and separated into six groups for each surface treatment method (n = 10); group 1: control group, no treatment applied; group 2: sandblasted by 30 μm silicate-coated alumina particles (CoJet Sandblasting); group 3: 50 μm Al(2) O(3) sandblasting; group 4: 10% hydrofluoric acid; group 5: no surface treatment + universal adhesive (3M Single Bond Universal); group 6: 200 mJ, 10 Hz 2W Er,Cr:YSGG laser treatment. For each specimen, surface roughness measurements in noncontact mode were taken after the surface treatments using a portable surface texture-measuring machine. A self-adhesive resin cement (3M U200) was applied on every surface treated with the help of a cylindrical mold (2 × 4 mm) and was filled gradually. Shear bond strength was measured using a universal test machine, and one-way ANOVA and a Duncan test (p = 0.05) were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Mean values of the shear bond strength varied between 7.75 and 10.73 MPa. Bond strength values were enhanced by all surface treatment methods compared to the control group. The difference between group 5 and the control group (p < 0.05) was statistically significant, whereas there were no considerable differences between other treatment methods. CONCLUSION: Surface treatments of hybrid ceramic resin blocks could enhance the bond strength to resin cement; however, using Single Bond Universal without surface treatment showed a higher bond strength value.",2019,1,0,
266, Human Gingival Epithelial Growth In Vitro on a Polymer-Infiltrated Ceramic Network Restorative Material,"M. J. Smallidge, J. V. Sabol, C. Aita-Holmes, H. Chuang and D. P. Dickinson", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the growth of primary human gingival epithelial (HGE) cells on polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material (Vita Enamic) with different surface roughnesses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PICN material specimens were polished with either silica carbide paper (grit-polished) or the manufacturer's polishing wheels (wheel-polished), and the surface roughness (R(a) ) measured. HGE cells were seeded and grown for 1, 3, or 6 days. Growth on tissue culture plastic was used as a control. Non-linear regression analysis was used to examine the effect of surface roughness on cell growth. RESULTS: HGE cell growth on tissue culture plastic fitted an exponential growth model over the 6-day experimental period (R(2) = 0.966). Through day 6, cell density on PICN decreased with increasing surface roughness, with a fit to an exponential decay model (R(2) = 0.666). A threshold R(a) value of 0.254 μm (95% CI 0.177-0.332) was determined as an upper limit for exponential growth. Cell growth was greatest on the group of specimens with R(a) value below 0.127μm. Specimens polished by the manufacturer's method produced surface roughness of 0.118 μm and below. CONCLUSIONS: PICN material polished to a smooth surface (R(a) < 0.254 μm) resulted in exponential growth of HGE cell growth compared to rough surfaces. Polishing PICN material as smooth as possible (below a R(a) of 0.127 μm) was found to maximize epithelial cell growth on the PICN material surface. The manufacturer's polishing method achieved a sufficiently smooth surface. These results are contrary to previous research regarding surface roughness of transgingival implant restoration components. The study results suggest that smoother restorative material surfaces could improve peri-implant soft tissue health.",2019,1,0,
185, Effects of mouthrinses on discoloration of CAD-CAM manufactured restorative materials,"M. H. Atala, E. Yeğin, N. Atala, E. Senlen and S. Bağlar", Am J Dent," PURPOSE: To investigate the in vitro effect of four different mouthrinses on discoloration of popular CAD-CAM blocks. METHODS: 40 specimens were prepared and then were divided into five groups (n = 8) for each CAD-CAM block (Vitablocks Mark II, IPS e-max CAD, GC LRF, Enamic, Cerasmart). In total, four different mouthrinses for each group (Listerine Zero, Parodontax, Kloroben, Oral B Pro-Expert) and distilled water for the control group were used. The specimens were immersed in 20 ml solution for 2 minutes, twice a day for 21 days with a 12-hour interval. Color changes were measured with a digital spectrophotometer (Vita Easyshade) after 7, 14 and 21 days and specimens were prepared. For statistical analysis, color changes ( ΔE) were calculated and Kruskal Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were used. RESULTS: There was not a significant difference in ΔE1 and ΔE2 values (P> 0.005) while there was a significant one in ΔE3 (P= 0.001) after Bonferroni correction for CAD-CAM materials were carried out as it is independent of the mouthrinse. Listerine Zero brought about the most noticeable color change in all CAD-CAM materials except e.Max after 21 days. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Discoloration effect of the tested mouthrinses on various CAD-CAM materials was different depending on the usage period. However, these differences did not exceed the clinically perceptible values.",2019,0,0,
249, Fracture Resistance of Various Thickness e.max CAD Lithium Disilicate Crowns Cemented on Different Supporting Substrates: An In Vitro Study,"S. E. Chen, A. C. Park, J. Wang, K. L. Knoernschild, S. Campbell and B. Yang", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of abutment material properties on the fracture resistance and failure mode of lithium disilicate (IPS e.max) CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/manufacturing) crowns on traditionally and minimally prepared simulated tooth substrates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty lithium disilicate (IPS e.max) CAD/CAM crowns were divided into three groups (n = 10): TD: traditional thickness crowns cemented on Paradigm MZ100 abutments; MD: minimal thickness crowns cemented on Paradigm MZ100 abutments; ME: minimal thickness crowns cemented on e.max abutments. The 3Shape system was used to scan, design and mill all abutments and crowns with a die space set to 40 µm. Traditional thickness crowns were designed based on manufacturer guidelines with 1.5 mm occlusal thickness and 1.0 mm margins. Minimal thickness crowns were designed with 0.7 mm occlusal thickness and 0.5 mm margins. MZ100 composite and e.max abutments were selected to simulate dentin and enamel substrates, respectively, based on their elastic-modulus. Variolink Esthetic was used to cement all samples following manufacturer's instructions. A universal testing machine was used to load all specimens to fracture with a 3 mm radius stainless steel hemispherical tip at a crosshead speed 0.5 mm/minute along the longitudinal axis of the abutment with a 1 mm thermoplastic film placed between the loading tip and crown surface. Data was analyzed using ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc assessment. Fractographic analysis was performed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: The mean fracture load (standard deviation) was 1499 (241) N for TD; 1228 (287) N for MD; and 1377 (96) N for ME. Statistically significant difference between groups did not exist (p = 0.157, F = 1.995). In groups TD and MD with low e-modulus abutments, the dispersion of a probability distribution (coefficient of variation: CV) was statistically higher than that of group ME with high e-modulus abutments. SEM illustrated larger micro-fracture dimensions in Group MD than Group ME. CONCLUSION: Minimal thickness e.max crowns did not demonstrate statistical difference in fracture resistance from traditional thickness crowns. Fracture mechanisms of minimal thickness e.max crowns may be affected by the e-modulus of the substrate. Minimal thickness e.max crowns may be a viable restorative option when supported by high e-modulus materials.",2019,0,0,
278, In Vitro Evaluation of Marginal and Internal Adaptations of Ceramic Inlay Restorations Associated with Immediate vs Delayed Dentin Sealing Techniques,"L. M. Ashy, H. Marghalani and N. Silikas", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the marginal and internal adaptations of ceramic inlay restorations placed with immediate dentin sealing (IDS) vs delayed dentin sealing (DDS) procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mesial and distal Class II cavities were prepared in 12 extracted molar teeth, which were randomly allocated into six groups of 2 teeth each. Lava Ultimate inlays were fabricated and luted to the cavities using All-Bond universal adhesive system and eCEMENT dual-curing resin cement following IDS/immediate cementation (control groups 1 and 2), IDS/delayed cementation (groups 3 and 4), or DDS/delayed cementation (groups 5 and 6) protocols. Teeth in groups 2, 4, and 6 were subjected to thermocycling of 500 cycles between 5°C and 55°C after inlay cementation. Following staining with silver nitrate solution, the marginal and internal gap volumes were determined using microcomputed tomography images. Statistical analyses were conducted using independent t test and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey post hoc test (P < .05). RESULTS: Marginal gap volume for DDS (1.856 ± 0.323 mm(3)) was significantly higher than that of IDS immediately after inlay cementation (0.891 ± 0.281 mm(3)) (P = .025). Following thermocycling, the internal gap volume for DDS (0.838 ± 0.248 mm(3)) was significantly higher than that for IDS (0.098 ± 0.066 mm(3)) (P = .000), but the marginal gap volume of DDS (1.964 ± 0.956 mm(3)) was not significantly different from that of IDS (1.426 ± 0.725 mm(3)) (P = .622). CONCLUSION: Luted ceramic inlays have a superior marginal adaptation right after cementation and a superior internal adaptation after thermocycling when using the IDS technique compared to the DDS technique. However, marginal adaptation after thermocycling was not significantly different between the two techniques.",2020,1,0,
273, Impact of the Microstructure of CAD/CAM Blocks on the Bonding Strength and the Bonded Interface,"H. Abouelleil, P. Colon, C. Jeannin, A. Goujat, N. Attik, L. Laforest, R. Gauthier and B. Grosgogeat", J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between the microstructure of CAD/CAM blocks and the quality of adhesion as function of the surface treatment and resin cement type. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two nano-ceramic composite resin CAD/CAM blocks, Lava Ultimate (LU) and Cerasmart (CS), and two Leucite-reinforced glass ceramic CAD/CAM IPS blocks, Empress(®) CAD (EM) and Initial(TM) LRF (IR), received either Hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sandblasting (SB) surface treatments. The blocks were then luted using two dual-cure resin cements, LinkForce (LF) and Multilink Automix (ML) with their corresponding silanes, resulting in 16 study groups. The luted blocks were then thermal-cycling (TC) for 5000 cycles and subjected to a microtensile bond strength (μTBS) test. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the treated surfaces were analyzed using ImageJ software and XRD analyses were performed for the two ceramic blocks. The data obtained were submitted to Games-Howell post-hoc nonparametric test to compare combinations of groups or treatments and a linear mixed-effects model for the factors surface treatment, block type, and resin cement, together with their first-degree interactions (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The lowest mean μTBS values were obtained with LU-HF, whereas the highest mean μTBS values were obtained with CS regardless of resin cement type and surface treatment method. IR-HF mean μTBS were significantly higher than IR-SB, EM-SB, and EM-HF. Analysis using ImageJ software demonstrated significant differences in the density and pore size after HF surface treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The specific microstructure of each block material within the same family group impacted the micromechanical retention and the bonded interface strength.",2021,1,1,
299, Influence of Different Luting Systems on Microleakage of CAD/CAM Composite Crowns: A Pilot Study,"M. A. Schlenz, M. Skroch, A. Schmidt, P. Rehmann and B. Wöstmann", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To investigate whether (1) the curing mode and (2) the use of the corresponding or noncorresponding crown luting system have an impact on the microleakage of computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) composite crowns after chewing simulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two CAD/CAM composite blocks (Lava Ultimate [n = 20] and LuxaCam Composite [n = 20]) and their luting systems and curing modes (light curing [LC] or chemical curing [CC]) were investigated. A dye penetration test was used to detect the presence of microleakage. RESULTS: Independently of the luting system, the LC groups showed a significantly lower microleakage compared to the CC groups (P < .05). Furthermore, the CC groups exhibited a reduction of microleakage if the CAD/CAM block and luting system were from the same manufacturer. CONCLUSION: For the CC mode, the corresponding block and luting system should be used.",2019,0,1,
64, Change in Color and Gloss Parameters of Stained Monolithic Resin-Ceramic CAD/CAM Materials After Simulated Aging: An In Vitro Study,"S. Mühlemann, S. Stromeyer, A. Ioannidis, T. Attin, C. H. Hämmerle and M. Özcan", Int J Prosthodont," PURPOSE: To measure the effect of simulated aging on stained resin-ceramic CAD/CAM materials regarding the durability of color and gloss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test specimens (n = 15 per material) were prepared out of CAD/CAM ingots from two resin nanoceramics (Lava Ultimate [LVU], Cerasmart [CER]) and a polymer-infiltrated ceramic (ENA, VITA Enamic) stained with the manufacturer's recommended staining kit using photopolymerization. Control specimens were made of feldspathic ceramic (VITA Mark II [VM2]) and stained by means of ceramic firing. Negative control specimens (n = 15) (no staining) were prepared for each group. Color and gloss measurements were performed before and after each aging cycle by means of mechanical abrasion with a toothbrush. Groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test and paired post hoc Conover test. Changes within a group were calculated using Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = .05). RESULTS: The color difference (ΔE) was statistically significant for all stained CAD/CAM materials after simulated aging: CER (P < .001, 95% CI: 2.96 to 3.69), LVU (P = .004, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.46), ENA (P = .004, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.42), and VM2 (P < .001, 95% CI: 0.29 to 1.08). Aging resulted in a statistically significant increase in gloss in the LVU group (P < 0.001, 95% CI: 13.78 to 17.29), whereas in the ENA (P < .001, 95% CI: 7.83 to 12.72), CER (P < .001, 95% CI: 2.69 to 8.44), and VM2 (P = .014, 95% CI: 0.22 to 1.87) groups, a significant decrease in gloss was noted.

11, [Three-dimensional finite element analysis of implant restoration in aesthetic zone of resin-ceramic composite single crown],"Y. R. Hong, Y. Li, W. Y. Luo, L. J. Xiao and Y. B. Gao", Shanghai Kou Qiang Yi Xue," PURPOSE: To observe and compare the stress distribution of implant, crown, abutment and surrounding bone tissues in the aesthetic zone after restoration of resin-ceramic composite single crown, and provide theoretical basis for clinical restoration. METHODS: Three-dimensional finite element models of alveolar bone, implant, crown, and the thickness of different adhesives between crown and abutment (0.05 mm and 0.1 mm) were established by using Mimics 17.0 software.Force was applied at the angle of 130° with the long axis of the implant, the loading position was 2 mm from the incisal cingulum, and other force on the incisal margin was loaded in parallel to the long axis of the implant. The size was 100 N. Linear static stress analysis was carried out to compare the Von Mises stress after single crown restoration with different materials. RESULTS: When the thickness of adhesive was 0.05 mm, and resin cement was selected, after restoration of Enamic, Ultimate resin ceramic composite crown, the peak stress of alveolar bone, implant, crown and abutment was more uniform and decreased slightly, but the difference was not significant compared with that of IPS Empress, blocs Mark Ⅱ ceramic crown. When the thickness of adhesive was 0.05 mm, the peak stress was significantly lower than that of 0.1 mm. There was no significant difference in the stress between glass ionomer cement and resin cement.Under the same conditions, restoration with Ultimate crown had smaller stress value of peak Von Mises. CONCLUSIONS: The stress of resin composite ceramics single crown when applied to implantation in aesthetic area is slightly less and more uniform. The proportion of resin in composites and the thickness of adhesive can affect the stress distribution and peak value.",2020,1,1,

Zhang", Shanghai Kou Qiang Yi Xue," PURPOSE: To provide theoretical basis for clinical CAD/CAM restorations with a comparison of the fracture strength between two chairside CAD/CAM immediate restorative materials (IPS e.max CAD and Vita Enamic) with different occlusal thickness in vitro. METHODS: IPS e.max CAD and Vita Enamic full-crowns with occlusal thicknesses 1.5/2.0/2.5 mm were fabricated with CEREC and adhesively seated to dies customized by manufacturer (n=42). All specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 ℃ for 24 h. Later, static fractural loading was performed. The fracture surface was observed through scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrum (EDS). The composites of two materials were detected by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The results of fracture strength were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and t-test via SPSS 20.0 software package. RESULTS: With the increase of occlusal thickness, the fracture strength of IPS e.max CAD increased remarkably. However, the Vita Enamic's fracture strength remained the same with no significant difference. With the occlusal thickness increased from 1.5 to 2.0 mm, there was no significant difference in the fracture strength between IPS e.max CAD group and Vita Enamic group. As the thickness increased from 1.5 to 2.0 mm, the fracture strength of IPS e.max CAD group was significantly higher than that of Vita Enamic group. The results of SEM showed that the filler particles of IPS e.max CAD were smaller compared to that of Vita Enamic. Cone cracks were mainly found in the fracture surface of IPS e.max CAD, while radical cracks appeared in Vita Enamic. EDS showed the metal oxide and SiO2 in Vita Enmic was significantly higher than that in IPS e.max CAD. XRD showed that the primary crystal phase of IPS e.max CAD was lithium silicate, while Vita Enamic was amorphous. CONCLUSIONS: Both IPS e.max CAD and Vita Enamic can meet the standard of clinical application as the occlusal thickness reaches 1.5 mm. IPS e.max CAD showed better fracture resistance when the thickness was greater than 2.0 mm.",2021,0,0,
238, Fracture load of zirconia implant supported CAD/CAM resin crowns and mechanical properties of restorative material and cement,"N. Rohr, S. Märtin and J. Fischer", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: To test if resin CAD/CAM materials should be considered for zirconia implants and how their mechanical properties affect the fracture load. METHODS: Fracture load of molar crowns of CAD/CAM materials (VITA CAD-Temp [CT], Cerasmart [CS], Lava Ultimate [LU], Pekkton Ivory [PK]) on zirconia implants (ceramic.implant, 4.0 mm) fixed either with no cement, temporary cement (Harvard Implant semi-permanent [HIS]), self-adhesive (VITA Adiva S-Cem [VAS]) or either one of two adhesive cements (Multilink Automix [MLA], VITA Adiva F-Cem [VAF]) was analyzed. The restorative materials were characterized by their flexural strength, fracture toughness, elemental composition and organic/inorganic ratio while compressive strength of the cements was measured. RESULTS: For the fracture load significantly highest mean values were fo und overall for PK (2921 ±300 N) > LU (2017 ±499 N) > CS (1463 ±367 N) = CT (1451 ±327 N) (p > 0.05). When analyzing the effect of the cement on the fracture load the overall ranking was VAF (2245 ±650 N) ≥ MLA (2188 ±708 N) ≥ VAS (2017 ±563 N) > HIS (1757 ±668 N) = no cement (1595 ±757 N) (p <0.05), meaning fracture load increased with the compressive strength of the cements. Additionally, a linear trend was found between the fracture load and the fracture toughness of the restorative materials. CONCLUSIONS: All restorative materials exhibited fracture load values similar or higher than lithium disilicate tested previously. Fracture load of CT, CS and LU can be significantly increased when an adhesive cement with a high compressive strength is used.",2021,0,0,

Fischer", J Prosthodont Res," PURPOSE: To test three potential prosthetic material options for zirconia implants in regard to their mechanical properties, loading and retention capacity as well as to record abrasion after chewing simulation followed by thermocyclic aging. METHODS: Molar crowns (n = 96) of three different computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials were produced and cemented on zirconia implants (ceramic.implant, Vita) with a diameter of 4.5 mm. Monolithic zirconia (Vita YZ [YZ] with RelyX Unicem 2 Automix [RUN], polymer-infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic [VE]) with Vita Adiva F-Cem [VAF] and acrylate polymer (CAD Temp [CT]) with RelyX Ultimate [RUL]. Fracture load and retentive force of the crowns were measured after 24 h water storage at 37 °C and after a chewing simulation followed by thermocyclic aging. Abrasion was recorded by matching stereolithography-data of the crowns obtained before and after chewing simulation. Additionally, the mechanical properties and bonding capabilities of the crown and cement materials were assessed. RESULTS: Fracture load values were significantly highest for YZ > VE = CT. Retention force values did not differ significantly between the materials. The aging procedure did not affect the fracture load values nor the retention force significantly. Abrasion depth of the crowns was lowest for YZ followed by VE and CT. On unpolished crowns, abrasion of YZ and VE tended to be higher than on polished specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the obtained in-vitro results, all tested materials can be recommended for the use on zirconia implants, although CT is only approved for temporary crowns. The loading and retention capacity of the materials were not significantly affected by aging.",2019,1,0,
286, In vitro lifetime of zirconium dioxide-based crowns veneered using Rapid Layer Technology,"C. Riedel, M. Wendler, R. Belli, A. Petschelt and U. Lohbauer", Eur J Oral Sci," Rapid Layer Technology (RLT) uses computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) to manufacture a veneer layer that is adhesively bonded to the zirconia framework, avoiding firing steps during the fabrication process and thus preventing build-up of residual stresses. This work studied, using sliding contact fatigue, the in vitro lifetime of restorations produced using RLT compared with restorations produced using conventional veneering techniques. Zirconia copings were veneered with a conventional hand-layering method (VM9) using a fast (n = 16) or a slow (n = 16) cooling protocol, or with RLT. For the latter, the veneers were CAD/CAM fabricated using a feldspathic reinforced-glass (Vitablocs Mark II; n = 16) or a polymer-infiltrated reinforced-glass network (Enamic; n = 16) and adhesively bonded to the zirconia frameworks. Crowns thus obtained were submitted to sliding contact fatigue against a steatite indenter in a chewing simulator until failure. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted. None of the hand-layered restorations survived after a 2 × 10(6) -cycle interval, whereas no fractures in the RLT groups were observed. Vitablocs Mark II veneers survived for a longer testing period (3.5 × 10(6) cycles) than their Enamic counterparts (2.5 × 10(6) cycles) owing to their superior wear behavior. The RLT represents an efficient method to veneer zirconia frameworks by reducing processing steps and, more importantly, increasing the lifetime of the restorations.",2019,0,0,
214, Fatigue analysis of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing resin-based composite vs. lithium disilicate glass-ceramic,"S. Ankyu, K. Nakamura, A. Harada, G. Hong, T. Kanno, Y. Niwano, U. Örtengren and H. Egusa", Eur J Oral Sci," Resin-based composite molar crowns made by computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems have been proposed as an inexpensive alternative to metal-ceramic or all-ceramic crowns. However, there is a lack of scientific information regarding fatigue resistance. This study aimed to analyze the fatigue behavior of CAD/CAM resin-based composite compared with lithium disilicate glass-ceramic. One-hundred and sixty bar-shaped specimens were fabricated using resin-based composite blocks [Lava Ultimate (LU); 3M/ESPE] and lithium disilicate glass-ceramic [IPS e.max press (EMP); Ivoclar/Vivadent]. The specimens were divided into four groups: no treatment (NT); thermal cycling (TC); mechanical cycling (MC); and thermal cycling followed by mechanical cycling (TCMC). Thermal cycling was performed by alternate immersion in water baths of 5°C and 55°C for 5 × 10(4) cycles. Mechanical cycling was performed in a three-point bending test, with a maximum load of 40 N, for 1.2 × 10(6) cycles. In addition, LU and EMP molar crowns were fabricated and subjected to fatigue treatments followed by load-to-failure testing. The flexural strength of LU was not severely reduced by the fatigue treatments. The fatigue treatments did not significantly affect the fracture resistance of LU molar crowns. The results demonstrate the potential of clinical application of CAD/CAM-generated resin-based composite molar crowns in terms of fatigue resistance.",2016,0,1,
172, Effect of Thickness and Shade of Resin and Ceramic- Based Hybrid Materials on Color Masking Abilities and Optical Performance of CAD/CAM Materials,"N. Al-Haj Husain, L. Walther, M. Özcan, U. Brägger and T. Joda", Eur J Prosthodont Restor Dent," Scientific data analysing color masking abilities of chairside CAD/CAM materials is lacking. The purpose of this in-vitro study was to evaluate the thickness and shade influence of three materials on their optical behaviour. Three materials: a) LD: Lithium disilicate glass ceramic (Emax, Ivoclar Vivadent), b) LDS: Lithium-disilicate-strengthened aluminosilicate glass ceramic (N!ce, Straumann) and c) RNC: Resin Nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE) were polished in different shades (A1,A2,A3) and thicknesses (0.1- 1.2mm). Specimens (N=108; n=36 per group) (12x12x1mm3) were positioned on resin composite base (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray) in shade A3. Spectrophotometric measurements were performed and the parameters thickness, shade and material were analysed using three-way ANOVA, and pairwise T-tests (P-values ⟨ 0.05). Both the shade (p⟨0.001) and the interaction of material in correlation to thickness (p⟨0.001) were significant. Shade value A1-A3 comparisons were significant A1 vs. A2 (p=0.045); A2 vs. A3 (p=0.002); A1 vs. A3 (p⟨0.001)). A significant correlation of the material and thickness was observed when comparing LD and LDS (p=0.007) at the thickness of 0.1-0.4 mm. Masking abilities were influenced by material and thickness choice. Reinforced glass ceramics showed the best results in the smallest thickness tested (0.1-0.4 mm). LDS could be considered as an advantageous alternative in minimal-invasive cases.",2021,1,0,
197, Evaluation of Adhesion Protocol for Titanium Base Abutments to Different Ceramic and Hybrid Materials,"G. S. Dhesi, S. Sidhu, N. Al-Haj Husain and M. Özcan", Eur J Prosthodont Restor Dent," Scientific evidence regarding conditioning of different ceramic and hybrid materials and their bonding on titanium abutments is lacking. Titanium disks (Tritan) (N=450, n=15) were randomly cemented onto five different ceramic and hybrid materials, namely 1. Zenostar T, 2. Lava Ultimate, 3. IPS e.max CAD, 4. Vita Enamic multicolor and 5. G-ceram using three different cements, Panavia 21, TheraCem and Multilink hybrid abutment. Half of all specimens were thermocycled (5000 cycles, 5-55°C), while the other half were kept dry. Macro shear bond testing was conducted using a universal testing machine. Failure types were classified using a digital microscope. Data was statistically analyzed with three-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post hoc tests. Both the ceramic (P⟨0.0001) and cement type(P⟨0.0001) significantly affected the shear bond strength(MPa), while thermocycling did not (P⟩0.05). The incidence of cohesive (50.34%) and adhesive failures (49.66%) were not significantly different. As for implant superstructures, when ceramics are bonded to titanium bases, the ceramic and cement type both have an impact on the bond strengths along with the conditioning and bonding protocols for each substrate. An equal affinity of the cements tested to the ceramic, hybrid materials and to titanium can be assumed. Combination of zirconia and TheraCem can be recommended for clinical use.",2021,1,0,
258, From orthodontic treatment plan to ultrathin no-prep CAD/CAM temporary veneers,S. Patroni and R. Cocconi, Int J Esthet Dent," Several treatment options are described in the literature to solve the microdontia-related problems of maxillary anterior teeth. These options are often focused on an orthodontic rather than a restorative approach. The case presented here started with an orthodontic phase followed by a restorative one. The aim of the orthodontic phase was to achieve the correct spacing, respecting ideal average tooth proportions. This was done using a digital setup to restore the six anterior teeth, so that an optimal esthetic and functional result was achieved by the end of the orthodontic treatment. The purpose of the restorative phase was to contribute to the esthetic outcome and occlusal stability. The 12-year-old patient was treated utilizing a CAD/CAM procedure, which took advantage of the mechanical properties and reasonable cost of the chosen resin matrix ceramic material (Vita Enamic). Once stability has been attained and proper periodontal tissue maturation has been reached at the end of the patient's growth, there will then be the option of improving the esthetics by replacing these restorations with ceramic veneers.",2017,1,0,

Lim", Astrobiology," Short-term and long-term science plans were developed as part of the strategic planning process used by the Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains (BASALT) science team to conduct two Mars-simulation missions investigating basalt habitability at terrestrial volcanic analog sites in 2016. A multidisciplinary team of scientists generated and codified a range of scientific hypotheses distilled into a Science Traceability Matrix (STM) that defined the set of objectives pursued in a series of extravehicular activity (EVA) campaigns performed across multiple field deployments. This STM was used to guide the pre-deployment selection of sampling stations within the selected Mars analog sites on the Earth based on precursor site information such as multispectral imagery. It also informed selection of hand-held instruments and observational data to collect during EVA to aid sample selection through latency-impacted interaction with an Earth-based Science Support Team. A significant portion of the pre-deployment strategic planning activities were devoted to station selection, ultimately the locations used for sample collection and EVA planning. During development of the EVAs, the BASALT science team identified lessons learned that could be used to inform future missions and analog activities, including the critical need for high-resolution precursor imagery that would enable the selection of stations that could meet the scientific objectives outlined in the STM.",2019,0,0,
461, Species Differentiation on a Dynamic Landscape: Shifts in Metapopulation Genetic Structure Using the Chronology of the Hawaiian Archipelago,"G. K. Roderick, P. J. Croucher, A. G. Vandergast and R. G. Gillespie", Evol Biol," Species formation during adaptive radiation often occurs in the context of a changing environment. The establishment and arrangement of populations, in space and time, sets up ecological and genetic processes that dictate the rate and pattern of differentiation. Here, we focus on how a dynamic habitat can affect genetic structure, and ultimately, differentiation among populations. We make use of the chronology and geographical history provided by the Hawaiian archipelago to examine the initial stages of population establishment and genetic divergence. We use data from a set of 6 spider lineages that differ in habitat affinities, some preferring low elevation habitats with a longer history of connection, others being more specialized for high elevation and/or wet forest, some with more general habitat affinities. We show that habitat preferences associated with lineages are important in ecological and genetic structuring. Lineages that have more restricted habitat preferences are subject to repeated episodes of isolation and fragmentation as a result of lava flows and vegetation succession. The initial dynamic set up by the landscape translates over time into discrete lineages. Further work is needed to understand how genetic changes interact with a changing set of ecological interactions amongst a shifting mosaic of landscapes to achieve species formation.",2012,0,0,
236, Fracture load of ceramic restorations after fatigue loading,"B. Baladhandayutham, N. C. Lawson and J. O. Burgess", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A clinician must decide what ceramic coping and veneer material to prescribe based on the amount of tooth reduction possible and the desired esthetic outcome of the restoration. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the fracture strength of monolithic and bilayered lithium disilicate (IPS e.max) and zirconia (LAVA) crowns at clinically relevant thicknesses after load cycling. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Crowns (n=8) were fabricated from 6 groups: 1.2-mm monolithic lithium disilicate, 1.5-mm monolithic lithium disilicate, 1.5-mm bilayered lithium disilicate with hand-layered veneer, 0.6 mm monolithic zirconia, 1.2-mm bilayered zirconia with hand-layered veneer, and 1.2-mm bilayered zirconia with milled veneer (dimension represents thickness at the occlusal pit). Crowns were cemented to identical milled resin dies with resin-modified glass ionomer cement. Cemented crowns were stored at 37°C for 24 hours and load cycled for 200,000 cycles at 25 N at a rate of 40 cycles/minute. The ultimate fracture load for each specimen was measured in a universal testing machine. Data were analyzed with a 1-way ANOVA and Tukey honest significant difference post hoc analysis (α=.05). RESULTS: Mean ±SD fracture load values were 1465 ±330 N for monolithic lithium disilicate (1.2-mm thickness) and 2027 ±365 N (1.5-mm thickness) and 1732 ±315 N for bilayered hand-veneered lithium disilicate (1.5-mm thickness). Fracture loads were 1669 ±311 N for monolithic zirconia crowns (0.6mm thickness), 2625 ±300 N for zirconia milled-veneered (1.2-mm thickness), and 2655 ±590N for zirconia hand-veneered crowns (1.2mm thickness). One-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference among the groups (P<.01). Veneered zirconia crowns showed the highest fracture strength, 1.2-mm hand veneered zirconia was similar to that of 1.5-mm monolithic zirconia, and all other groups were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: Crowns of 1.2-mm bilayered zirconia had higher fracture loads than 0.6-mm zirconia or 1.2-mm lithium disilicate monolithic crowns.",2015,0,0,
513, The use of MDP-based materials for bonding to zirconia,"G. de Souza, D. Hennig, A. Aggarwal and L. E. Tam", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A strong and stable bond between the luting resin and overlying ceramic restoration is critical to longevity, but no technique has been established for how to provide such a bond when the core material is zirconia. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different materials containing 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) on the bond strength to yttria-tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) ceramic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty Y-TZP slices (Lava) were cemented to substrates (8 groups; n=5 in each) with or without the previous application of an experimental primer (0.5% MDP) or an MDP-based adhesive (Clearfil S3 Bond Plus or Scotchbond Universal) with either an MDP (Clearfil SA) or a non-MDP (RelyX Ultimate) luting resin. Specimens were cut, stored in distilled water, and microtensile tested (5 beams per specimen) at 48 hours and again at 6 months after luting procedures. The data were analyzed by 4-way ANOVA (α=.05) and the Tukey test (α=.05). The mode of failure was classified with a stereomicroscope, and the treated surfaces were analyzed with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. RESULTS: Both adhesive (P<.001) and time (P<.001) significantly affected bond strength. The interaction of any of the factors was not significant. The use of an MDP-containing adhesive and the shorter storage time were associated with higher bond strengths. At 48 hours, an overall incidence of 50.5% of Type 1 mode of failure (adhesive at ceramic/resin interface) occurred, as opposed to 68% after 6 months of water storage. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy results showed peaks of carbon and phosphorus when MDP-based materials were used. CONCLUSIONS: The application of an MDP-based adhesive may improve bond strength to zirconia. However, microtensile bond strength results for all groups did not remain stable over 6 months.",2014,0,0,
358, Mechanical and optical properties of monolithic CAD-CAM restorative materials,N. Sen and Y. O. Us, J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Achieving natural tooth appearance with sufficient mechanical strength is one of the most challenging issues of computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials. However, limited evidence is available regarding their optical and mechanical properties for proper and evidence-based material selection in clinical practice. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess and compare the translucency and biaxial flexural strength of 5 monolithic CAD-CAM restorative materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Disk-shaped specimens (n=30) of each material (Lava Ultimate [LU], Vita Enamic [VE], Vitablocs Mark II [VMII], Vita Suprinity [VS], and IPS e.max CAD [IPS]) with a diameter of 12 mm and a thickness of 1.2 ±0.05 mm were prepared. A spectrophotometer was used to measure the translucency parameter. The specimens were then subjected to a biaxial flexure test using 3 balls and loaded with a piston in a universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min until failure occurred (International Organization for Standardization standard 6872). Weibull statistics were used to evaluate the characteristic strength and reliability of each material. Chemical compositions were analyzed using an energy dispersive spectrometer, and microstructural analysis was conducted using scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and the Tukey honest significant difference test (α=.05). RESULTS: Significant differences were found among the materials concerning translucency and biaxial flexural strength (P<.05). The highest mean transparency value was obtained in the VS group, whereas the lowest mean value was obtained in the VE group. The VS group produced the highest mean biaxial flexural strength, followed by the IPS, LU, VE, and VMII groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of the present study, zirconia-reinforced glass-ceramic revealed higher mean translucency and biaxial flexural strength than resin nanoceramic, feldspathic ceramic, lithium disilicate ceramic, and dual-network ceramic.",2018,0,0,
279, In vitro evaluation of material dependent force damping behavior of implant-supported restorations using different CAD-CAM materials and luting conditions,D. Taha and A. Sabet, J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Although force-damping behavior that matches natural teeth may be unobtainable, an optimal combination of crown material and luting agent might have a beneficial effect on the force absorption capacity of implant-supported restorations. However, the force-absorbing behavior of various restorative materials has not yet been satisfactorily investigated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the material dependent force-damping behavior of implant-supported crowns fabricated from different computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials luted to implant abutments under different conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Titanium inserts (N=84) were screwed to implant analogs, scanned to design zirconia abutments, and divided into 4 groups to receive CAD-CAM fabricated crowns in 4 materials: zirconia, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polymer-infiltrated ceramics (VITA ENAMIC), and lithium disilicate (e.max). The crowns were subdivided as per the luting agent: none, interim cement, and adhesive resin cement. Measurements were performed by loading specimens in a universal testing machine with an increasing force and measuring the resulting force with a digital forcemeter, followed by image processing and data acquisition. Two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to assess all interactions with multiple pairwise comparisons (α=.05). RESULTS: The curve progression of the applied and resulting forces varied significantly among the investigated materials, resulting in differently inclined slopes for each material (P<.001). With no cementation, the mean slope values of the resulting force curves ranged from 77.5 ±0.03 degrees for zirconia, followed by 71.8 ±0.03 degrees for lithium disilicate, 56.2 ±0.1 degrees for polymer-infiltrated ceramics, and 51.1 ±0.01 degrees for polyetheretherketone. With interim cementation, the mean slope values ranged from 75.4 ±0.01 degrees for zirconia, followed by 70.05 ±0.02 degrees for lithium disilicate, 56.1 ±0.02 degrees for polymer-infiltrated ceramics, and 52.2 ±0.1 degrees for polyetheretherketone. As with adhesive cementation, curve slopes ranged from 73.2 ±0.02 degrees for zirconia, followed by 70.5 ±0.2 degrees for lithium disilicate, 55.9 ±0.04 degrees for polymer-infiltrated ceramics, and 52.3 ±0.1 degrees for polyetheretherketone. Slope loss was significant after the cementation of zirconia and lithium disilicate crowns but less significant for polymer-infiltrated ceramics and polyetheretherketone. CONCLUSIONS: Force damping is generally material dependent, yet implant-supported crowns fabricated from resilient materials such as polymer-infiltrated ceramics and PEEK show better force absorption than rigid materials such as zirconia and lithium disilicate ceramics. Furthermore, cementation of rigid materials significantly increased slope loss, indicating enhancement in their force-damping behavior, whereas less-rigid materials benefit less from cementation. Further studies are essential to investigate the effect of prosthetic materials on the stress distribution to the peri-implant bone in the crown-abutment-implant complex.",2021,1,0,
342, Machinability of CAD-CAM materials,"R. Chavali, A. H. Nejat and N. C. Lawson", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Although new materials are available for computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) fabrication, limited information is available regarding their machinability. The depth of penetration of a milling tool into a material during a timed milling cycle may indicate its machinability. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the tool penetration rate for 2 polymer-containing CAD-CAM materials (Lava Ultimate and Enamic) and 2 ceramic-based CAD-CAM materials (e.max CAD and Celtra Duo). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The materials were sectioned into 4-mm-thick specimens (n=5/material) and polished with 320-grit SiC paper. Each specimen was loaded into a custom milling apparatus. The apparatus pushed the specimens against a milling tool (E4D Tapered 2016000) rotating at 40 000 RPM with a constant force of 0.98 N. After a 6-minute timed milling cycle, the length of each milling cut was measured with image analysis software under a digital light microscope. Representative specimens and milling tools were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. RESULTS: The penetration rate of Lava Ultimate (3.21 ±0.46 mm/min) and Enamic (2.53 ±0.57 mm/min) was significantly greater than that of e.max CAD (1.12 ±0.32 mm/min) or Celtra Duo (0.80 ±0.21 mm/min) materials. SEM observations showed little tool damage, regardless of material type. Residual material was found on the tools used with polymer-containing materials, and wear of the embedding medium was seen on the tools used with the ceramic-based materials. Edge chipping was noted on cuts made in the ceramic-based materials. CONCLUSIONS: Lava Ultimate and Enamic have greater machinability and less edge chipping than e.max CAD and Celtra Duo.",2017,0,0,
126, Effect of color of the cement and the composite resin foundation on the resultant color of resin-matrix ceramics,"Ö. Önöral, B. Günal-Abduljalil and S. Ongun", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: An improper restoration color match to the adjacent natural teeth can jeopardize esthetic success. The type of resin-matrix ceramic (RMC), the shade of the underlying foundation, and the shade of cement may affect the optical behavior of RMC materials, but studies on this issue are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess the cumulative effect of different shades of composite resin foundation (CRF) and cement on the optical behaviors of 3 different RMCs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five rectangular RMC specimens (14×12×1 mm, shade A2) were prepared from 3 different blocks, including a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (Vita Enamic [VE]), a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate [LU]), and a flexible nanoparticle-filled resin (GC Cerasmart [GC]) (n=15 per RMC block). CRFs (14×12×4 mm) were fabricated in white and dentin shades (n=1 per composite resin shade). Cement specimens (G-CEM LinkForce) were prepared from 3 shades (A2, opaque [OP], and translucent [TR]) (n=15 per shade). For control groups, 3 rectangular RMC foundations (14×12×4 mm) were also milled from RMC blocks (n=1 per block). Color coordinates were recorded by using a digital spectrophotometer. The coordinates of 4-mm-thick RMC foundations served as the control groups. The coordinates of RMC specimens on each combination of CRF and cement served as test groups. The CIEDE2000 (ΔE(00)) formula was used to assess color differences. Data were subjected to 3-way ANOVA and Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) tests (α=.05). RESULTS: ΔE(00) values of specimens were influenced by the CRF shade, cement shade, RMC type, as well as the interaction terms of the 3 variables (P<.001). Color differences in groups VE-A2-dentin, VE-OP-dentin, LU-OP-dentin, and GC-OP-dentin showed perceptible but clinically acceptable values (0.8<ΔE(00)≤1.8). The highest and lowest ΔE(00) values were observed in the white-OP-LU (5.32 ±0.34) and dentin-OP-VE (0.94 ±0.31) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Opaque cement on the white foundation led to the highest ΔE(00) values in the resultant colors of all RMC groups. When used with the same shade on the dentin foundation, this cement produced clinically acceptable results.",2021,1,0,
276, In vitro color stainability and relative translucency of CAD-CAM restorative materials used for laminate veneers and complete crowns,"R. Arif, B. Yilmaz and W. M. Johnston", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Assessing the long-term stainability and durability of restorative materials is an important parameter for determining clinical success and longevity. Information remains limited regarding the color stainability and translucency of the recently introduced ceramic materials for restorative treatment. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of cyclic immersion in hot and cold coffee on the color stainability and translucency of 6 computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorative materials at thicknesses which represent a laminate veneer and a complete crown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CAD-CAM restorative materials including zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic (Celtra Duo), lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), polymerized resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate), integrated ceramic and acrylate polymer network material (VITA ENAMIC), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (VITA SUPRINITY), and zirconia (VITA YZ HT) were studied in 2 thicknesses for laminate veneer (0.7 mm) and complete crown application (1.3 mm to 1.5 mm). For each specimen, color difference on a gray backing was calculated using a spectroradiometer between its baseline color and after 6000 cycles of coffee thermocycling. The colors of the specimens on the black and white backings were used to calculate the relative translucency parameter from the CIEDE2000 color difference formula. An ANOVA and the Bonferroni-corrected Student t tests were used for testing statistical significance (α=.05). RESULTS: No difference was found among the means of color change after coffee thermocycling between any 2 materials for the crown thickness (P>.999), and no difference was found among the means of color change between the 2 thickness groups within each material (P≥.187). However, the mean color change of the resin nanoceramic material in laminate veneer application (0.7 mm) was greater than that of every other material in the veneer thickness group (P<.001), and the mean color change of the integrated ceramic and acrylate polymer network material was greater than that of the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic material studied at the veneer thickness (P=.014). Translucency was found to be lower for complete crown thickness compared with laminate veneer thickness within each combination of material and coffee thermocycling (P<.001). The translucency of the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic material studied at the laminate veneer thickness was also found to be higher after coffee thermocycling (P=.033). Furthermore, several differences among materials were found for each combination of thickness and coffee. CONCLUSIONS: Color change after coffee thermocycling of the resin nanoceramic material was beyond the acceptability threshold. The lower translucency found for crown thickness compared with veneer thickness was verified.",2019,1,0,
120, Effect of artificial toothbrushing and water storage on the surface roughness and micromechanical properties of tooth-colored CAD-CAM materials,"S. Flury, E. Diebold, A. Peutzfeldt and A. Lussi", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Because of the different composition of resin-ceramic computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials, their polishability and their micromechanical properties vary. Moreover, depending on the composition of the materials, their surface roughness and micromechanical properties are likely to change with time. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of artificial toothbrushing and water storage on the surface roughness (Ra and Rz) and the micromechanical properties, surface hardness (Vickers [VHN]) and indentation modulus (E(IT)), of 5 different tooth-colored CAD-CAM materials when polished with 2 different polishing systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens (n=40 per material) were cut from a composite resin (Paradigm MZ100; 3M ESPE), a feldspathic ceramic (Vitablocs Mark II; Vita Zahnfabrik), a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate; 3M ESPE), a hybrid dental ceramic (Vita Enamic; Vita Zahnfabrik), and a nanocomposite resin (Ambarino High-Class; Creamed). All specimens were roughened in a standardized manner and polished either with Sof-Lex XT discs or the Vita Polishing Set Clinical. Surface roughness, VHN, and E(IT) were measured after polishing and after storage for 6 months (tap water, 37°C) with periodic, artificial toothbrushing. The surface roughness, VHN, and E(IT) results were analyzed with a nonparametric ANOVA followed by Kruskal-Wallis and exact Wilcoxon rank sum tests (α=.05). RESULTS: Irrespective of polishing system and of artificial toothbrushing and storage, Lava Ultimate generally showed the lowest surface roughness and Vitablocs Mark II the highest. As regards micromechanical properties, the following ranking of the CAD-CAM materials was found (from highest VHN/E(IT) to lowest VHN/E(IT)): Vitablocs Mark II > Vita Enamic > Paradigm MZ100 > Lava Ultimate > Ambarino High-Class. Irrespective of material and of artificial toothbrushing and storage, polishing with Sof-Lex XT discs resulted in lower surface roughness than the Vita Polishing Set Clinical (P≤.016). However, the polishing system generally had no influence on the micromechanical properties (P>.05). The effect of artificial toothbrushing and storage on surface roughness depended on the material and the polishing system: Ambarino High-Class was most sensitive to storage, Lava Ultimate and Vita Enamic were least sensitive. Artificial toothbrushing and storage generally resulted in a decrease in VHN and E(IT) for Paradigm MZ100, Lava Ultimate, and Ambarino High-Class but not for Vita Enamic and Vitablocs Mark II. CONCLUSIONS: Tooth-colored CAD-CAM materials with lower VHN and E(IT) generally showed better polishability. However, these materials were more prone to degradation by artificial toothbrushing and water storage than materials with higher VHN and E(IT).",2017,1,1,
271, Impact of simulated toothbrushing on surface properties of chairside CAD-CAM materials: An in vitro study,"G. S. de Andrade, M. G. Augusto, B. V. Simões, C. Pagani, G. Saavedra and E. Bresciani", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Chairside computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials that do not require any firing steps are a promising option to expedite restoration production; however, little information is available to determine the most suitable material for each clinical situation. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of simulated toothbrushing on surface gloss, roughness, and wear of chairside CAD-CAM materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Disk-shaped specimens (n=15) were prepared of the following materials: ENA-VITA Enamic; LAV-Lava Ultimate; EMP-IPS Empress CAD; CER-Cerasmart; GRA-Grandio blocs. Gloss (Gloss Unit-GU) and surface roughness (Ra-μm) were evaluated before and after simulated toothbrushing (100 000 strokes). Wear (μm) was assessed by contact profilometry. Additional analyses of microhardness by scanning electron microscopy were also performed. Data were analyzed with 2-way repeated measures ANOVA test for roughness and gloss, and 1-way ANOVA for wear (α=.05). To estimate the correlation between Ra and GU, the Pearson correlation was calculated. RESULTS: Before brushing, CER showed the lowest Ra (P<.001), and GRA the lowest GU values. After brushing, the feldspathic ceramic-based materials (ENA and EMP) presented the highest gloss, whereas the ceramic group (EMP) showed the lowest Ra. Before and after brushing, GRA showed the lowest GU values. Higher wear values were found for the composite resin groups (CER>GRA), with the exception of LAVA, which was similar to ENA, and EMP showing improved wear resistance. A strong negative correlation (-0.925) between GU and Ra values was detected (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The materials containing a glass phase (ENA and EMP) presented higher wear resistance, higher gloss, and lower roughness after brushing than the other materials tested. The correlation test showed that the higher the surface roughness, the lower the gloss.",2021,1,1,
105, Discoloration and translucency changes of CAD-CAM materials after exposure to beverages,"Ç. Barutçugil, D. Bilgili, K. Barutcigil, A. Dündar, U. Büyükkaplan and B. Yilmaz", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Color and translucency changes of recently introduced composite resin blocks after long-term exposure to various staining agents have not been fully investigated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the color stainability and translucency changes of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials immersed in beverages with staining potential. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three types of CAD-CAM blocks were used: 3M Lava Ultimate (LU), GC Cerasmart (CS), and VITA Enamic (VE). Forty-five rectangular specimens (1.5-mm thickness) of each product were prepared. The specimens were divided into 3 subgroups (n=15 in each) according to the immersion beverage. The specimens were then immersed in distilled water, red wine, and coffee for 30 days. Color parameters (ΔE(00)), the translucency parameter, and the contrast ratio were determined after 24 hours and 1 month. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests and the Wilcoxon, Freidman, and repeated measurement ANOVA tests were used for statistical analysis (α=.05). RESULTS: None of the materials showed clinically perceptible color changes except CS specimens immersed in coffee for 24 hours. The materials immersed in red wine and coffee for 1 month showed greater discoloration than those immersed in water (P<.05). The LU immersed in red wine showed the highest translucency changes, and VE was more resistant to translucency changes, as compared with the other materials tested. The contrast ratio values of the LU material were higher than those of the CS and VE materials in all the beverages. CONCLUSIONS: The red wine and coffee caused significant changes in the color and translucency of these novel CAD-CAM materials after a long immersion period.",2019,0,1,
89, Comparative in vitro wear resistance of CAD/CAM composite resin and ceramic materials,"L. Zhi, T. Bortolotto and I. Krejci", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Composite resin is a promising option in computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) dentistry; however, the wear resistance of composite resin remains a primary concern. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the wear resistance of 5 CAD/CAM materials (n=10), consisting of 4 composite resins (3M Lava Ultimate, Kerr experimental composite resin material, Vita Enamic, 3M Paradigm MZ100) and 1 ceramic (Vita Mark II) in contact with natural human enamel cusps. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens were loaded into a computer-controlled mastication simulator and subjected to 200000 mechanical cycles (49 N) against natural human enamel simultaneously with 500 thermal cycles (5°C to 50°C to 5°C). The wear resistance was analyzed by measuring the vertical substance loss (the maximum depth of the worn area) in the contact point area of the specimen. The worn surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscopy to determine the wear patterns. RESULTS: Vita Mark II exhibited the best wear resistance among the tested materials, followed by 3M Lava Ultimate, Vita Enamic, and 3M Paradigm MZ100. The Kerr experimental material exhibited the lowest wear resistance, yet its results were not significantly different from those of the 3 other composite resin blocks (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this in vitro study, the wear resistance of composite resin blocks in contact with enamel cusps was significantly lower than that of a ceramic block.",2016,0,1,
531, Wear resistance and abrasiveness of CAD-CAM monolithic materials,"F. S. Ludovichetti, F. Z. Trindade, A. Werner, C. J. Kleverlaan and R. G. Fonseca", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorations are in contact with the antagonist tooth, either a natural tooth or a restoration. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the wear resistance of CAD-CAM materials and the wear behavior of the antagonist. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the wear resistance and abrasiveness of CAD-CAM materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a 2-body wear test, the materials IPS e.max CAD (Ivoclar Vivadent AG), Vita Suprinity (Vita Zahnfabrik), Lava Ultimate (3M ESPE), Vita Enamic (Vita Zahnfabrik), and Lava Plus (3M ESPE) acted as abraders and, together with bovine enamel, also as antagonists. Each antagonist wheel ran against each abrader wheel for 200000 cycles, with a spring force of 15 N, and at a rotational speed of 1 Hz in distilled water. The wear rate was determined with a surface profilometer. The surfaces were observed with scanning electron microscopy, and their hardness, coefficient of friction, and roughness were evaluated. RESULTS: Lava Plus and IPS e.max CAD exhibited the highest potential for wear of Lava Ultimate. These 2 materials, together with Vita Suprinity, provided the highest wear of enamel and Vita Enamic. Vita Suprinity and IPS e.max CAD had higher wear than Lava Plus, and the inverse was also true. Vita Enamic and Lava Ultimate were among the materials that caused the lowest wear of enamel and all other evaluated materials. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that except for Lava Ultimate, all other materials damaged enamel, in which Vita Suprinity and IPS e.max CAD were more aggressive when sliding against the materials. Lava Plus had the greatest hardness, followed by Vita Suprinity and IPS e.max CAD, Vita Enamic, and then Lava Ultimate. The coefficient of friction varied from 0.42 to 0.53. The Vita Enamic and Lava Ultimate showed the highest surface roughness. CONCLUSIONS: The nanofilled composite resin and polymer-infiltrated ceramic were more antagonist-friendly (whether enamel or CAD-CAM material) than glass-ceramics and zirconia. Care should be taken when selecting the material that will contact mainly with glass-ceramics. Hardness should also be considered when selecting a material.",2018,1,1,
293, Influence of CAD/CAM tool and material on tool wear and roughness of dental prostheses after milling,"N. Lebon, L. Tapie, E. Vennat and B. Mawussi", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) machining influences the surface roughness of dental restorations and tool wear. Roughness must be suitable to meet clinical requirements, and the tool must last as long as possible. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the influence of the CAD/CAM tool-material couple on tool wear and surface roughness after milling. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three tools (Lyra conical tool Ø1 mm; GACD SASU, Lyra conical tool Ø1.05 mm; GACD SASU, and Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12S; Sirona Dental Systems GmbH) and 3 CAD/CAM materials (Lava Ultimate; 3M ESPE, Mark II; VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH, and Enamic; VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH) were tested. The tool wear of 6 tool-material couples at a feed rate of 2 m/min was analyzed before and after 8 minutes of flank and climb milling with optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and tool weighing. The surface roughness after milling was observed for 9 tool-material couples for flank and climb milling. Feed rates of 1, 2, 3, and 4.8 m/min were used for each couple. Ra, Rt, Rz, Sa, Sq, and Sz roughness criteria were measured. A paired comparison of tool-material couples was conducted with the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The Mark II material led to more severe tool wear. Milling of Lava Ultimate resulted in chip deposits on the tool grit. The Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12S was less worn for each material tested. The Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12S and the Lyra conical tool Ø1.05 mm provided similar roughness measurements for the 3 materials tested. The Lyra conical tool Ø1.05 mm tool provided better roughness than the Lyra conical tool Ø1 mm tool for the Enamic material. CONCLUSION: Tool lifetime calculated by volume of milled material removed should be the measure provided by CAD/CAM manufacturers instead of a number of blocks. This tool lifetime should be provided for the milling conditions associated with the material milled. Material hardness and tool grit are key factors for achieving a given roughness.",2015,0,0,
465, Staining and aging-dependent changes in color of CAD-CAM materials,"D. D. Stamenković, R. N. Tango, A. Todorović, D. Karasan, I. Sailer and R. D. Paravina", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Consumption of some beverages and aging may affect the color of dental materials used in fixed prosthodontics, but their effect on recently introduced materials is not well known. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate staining, aging, and the exposure interval on color changes of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) resin nanoceramics (RNC), polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) materials, and lithium silicate and lithium disilicate ceramics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 288 square-shaped, 1-mm-thick specimens prepared from Cerasmart, IPS e.max, Lava Ultimate, Shofu HC, Vita Enamic, and Vita Suprinity were polished by using laboratory and chairside methods in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions. Color data were recorded with a benchtop spectrophotometer, and CIEDE2000 color differences (ΔE(00)) were calculated. After the baseline measurements (T0), the specimens were divided into 3 groups (n=8) and exposed to staining in coffee and wine and to accelerated artificial aging. The specimens were stored in staining solutions at 37 °C for 60 (T1) and 120 hours (T2). Accelerated aging was performed by using a xenon lamp weathering test chamber for a total exposure of 150 (T1) and 300 kJ/m(2) (T2). The results were analyzed by using the t test, ANOVA, and the Tukey honestly significant difference test (α=.05). Color differences of ΔE(00) ≤0.8 and ≤1.8 corresponding to the 50:50% perceptibility threshold and 50:50% acceptability threshold were used to interpret the results. RESULTS: As color differences (ΔE(00)) between laboratory and chairside polishing were not statistically significant (T=-0.81, P=.418), only the results for chairside polished specimens were presented. Color differences for the T0-T1 comparisons ranged from 0.2 to 4.2, T0-T2 from 0.3 to 6.5, and T1-T2 from 0.1 to 2.3. ANOVA showed significance of factors and for interactions (P<.05). Lithium silicate-based and lithium disilicate-based ceramic materials were more color stable than RCN and PICN materials on exposure to coffee and red wine. Color changes greater than acceptability threshold after immersion in coffee were recorded for 3 (T0-T1), 4 (T0-T2), and 2 (T1-T2) materials. Corresponding findings after immersion in wine were 1, 3, and 0 and after artificial aging 0, 2, and 0. ΔE(00) and ΔE(ab) values were highly correlated (R(2)=0.97). CONCLUSIONS: No difference was found in color stability among laboratory and chairside polished specimens. Coffee caused the greatest color changes for T0-T2 interval. Staining-dependent color differences increased with increased exposure, except for IPS e.max and Vita Suprinity. For artificial aging, color change appeared to be material dependent.",2020,1,0,
96, Computer-aided-design/computer-assisted-manufactured adhesive restoration of molars with a compromised cusp: effect of fiber-reinforced immediate dentin sealing and cusp overlap on fatigue strength,"P. Magne, L. L. Boff, E. Oderich and A. C. Cardoso", J Esthet Restor Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Cracked teeth may traditionally require the use of complete coverage crowns. Alternative conservative treatments involve the use of adhesive inlays/onlays with the possibility of including a fiber patch to reinforce the cracked cusp. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fatigue strength of compromised molars restored with computer-aided-design/computer-assisted-manufactured (CAD/CAM) composite resin inlays/onlays with and without fiber-reinforced immediate dentin sealing (IDS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Large mesio-occluso-distal preparations with cracked/undermined palatal cusps were simulated on 40 extracted maxillary molars. All teeth received IDS (Optibond FL, Kerr, Orange, CA, USA), and composite resin (Paradigm MZ100, 3M-ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) inlays (N = 20) and onlays (N = 20). A fiber patch (Ribbond, Ribbond Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) was applied in half of the preparations. Restorations were adhesively luted with pre-heated composite resin (Z100, 3-M ESPE) and submitted to cyclic isometric loading at 5 Hz, starting with a load of 50 N (5,000 cycles), followed by stages of 150, 300, 450, 600, 750, 900, and 1,050 N at a maximum of 25,000 cycles each. Specimens were loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 180,000 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table survival analysis. RESULTS: Differences in survival probability were found (p = 0.04). The inlay group with fiber patch failed at an average load of 870 N, and none of the specimens withstood all 180,000 load cycles; survival rates of inlays and onlays without fibers, and onlays with fibers were 10, 30, and 50%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Onlays (with or without fibers) increased the fatigue resistance of compromised molars in this in vitro study.",2012,0,1,
398, Optical behaviors of esthetic CAD-CAM restorations after different surface finishing and polishing procedures and UV aging: An in vitro study,H. Kilinc and S. Turgut, J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Esthetic computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials have various chemical compositions and can be prepared by using different finishing and polishing procedures. Their optical properties may change over time, depending on these factors. However, information about their stain resistance is still scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the optical properties of esthetic CAD-CAM materials after different finishing and polishing procedures and ultraviolet (UV) aging. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Lava Ultimate, Cerasmart, Vita Enamic, Vita Suprinity, and Vita Mark II materials were used. A total of 150 specimens (14×12×1 mm) were prepared (n=10). A spectrophotometer was used to measure color parameters after different finishing and polishing procedures (control, manual polishing, glazing) and ultraviolet (UV) aging. Lightness (L*), green-red (a*), blue-yellow (b*), chroma (Ch), and hue (h) parameters were recorded, and change in lightness (ΔE*) values were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed with 2-way ANOVA, the Fisher least significant difference test, and the paired samples t test (α=.05). RESULTS: Significant interactions were noted between the aging conditions, material type, and finishing and polishing procedures for all evaluated parameters (P<.001). Vita Suprinity and Vita Mark II glazing groups resulted in significantly higher L(1)* values (P<.05) after the first color measurements. The b(1)* and C(1) values of Vita Suprinity were higher than for other materials (P<.05). The highest ΔE* value was observed in the Lava Ultimate-glazing group (ΔE*=22.7) and the lowest in the Vita Mark II-control group (ΔE*=0.86). CONCLUSIONS: The optical properties of CAD-CAM materials can be affected by the material type and the applied surface finishing and polishing procedure. Manual polishing seems to be a better choice for Lava Ultimate and Cerasmart and glazing for Vita Enamic. For ceramic materials, manual polishing or glazing can be recommended in terms of color stability.",2018,0,0,
116, Effect of acidic pH on surface roughness of esthetic dental materials,"M. Alnasser, M. Finkelman, A. Papathanasiou, M. Suzuki, R. Ghaffari and A. Ali", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Exposure to gastric acid in patients with bulimia nervosa and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) causes demineralization of hard tooth structures. This chemical attack also causes the degradation of dental ceramics, which results in increased surface roughness and reduced strength. However, studies comparing the effect of acidic pH on resin matrix ceramic with other computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) esthetic materials are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the surface roughness changes of different CAD-CAM restorative dental materials after exposure to acidic pH by using a 3D optical interferometer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five esthetic CAD-CAM block materials, a leucite glass-ceramic (IPS Empress CAD), a zirconia (BruxZir Solid Zirconia), a resin matrix ceramic (VITA Enamic), a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), and a feldspathic porcelain (VITABLOCS Mark II CAD) were tested. Eighteen specimens were sectioned from CAD-CAM blocks into 2-mm-thick rectangular plates and immersed in 10 mL of 5% hydrochloric acid (HCl) with (pH=2) at 37 °C for 45 and 91 hours. The surface roughness average (Ra) of the specimens was measured by using a 3D optical interferometer before the storage period (baseline), after 45 hours, and after 91 hours of exposure to HCl. Statistical analyses were performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test and the post hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni correction (α=.05). RESULTS: Regarding the comparison of surface roughness changes at different periods of evaluation (baseline, 45 hours, 91 hours), there were no statistically significant differences for lithium disilicate (P=.063) or zirconia (P=.513). Leucite glass-ceramic, feldspathic porcelain, and the resin matrix ceramic demonstrated statistically significant differences (P<.001). For all tests that were statistically significant, greater surface roughness was found at the time point with the longer HCl exposure. Regarding the comparison of materials in terms of change in surface roughness between baseline to 45 hours and baseline to 91 hours, the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a statistically significant difference among the materials in both cases (P<.001). Lithium disilicate and zirconia exhibited the least change in surface roughness among the 5 materials. CONCLUSIONS: Leucite glass-ceramic, feldspathic porcelain, and resin matrix ceramic showed statistically significant increases in surface roughness when they were exposed to simulated gastric acid for 45 and 91 hours. Lithium disilicate and zirconia showed no statistically significant change in surface roughness after exposure to HCl for 45 and 91 hours.",2019,1,0,
346, Marginal adaptation of CAD-CAM onlays: Influence of preparation design and impression technique,"F. F. Lima, C. F. Neto, J. H. Rubo, G. C. Santos, Jr. and M. J. Moraes Coelho Santos", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Factors that may affect the marginal adaptation of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorations include preparation design, impression technique, and CAD-CAM system. The influence of impression technique and preparation design on CAD-CAM partial coverage restorations has not been fully addressed. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of direct and indirect digital scanning techniques and 2 preparation designs on the marginal adaptation of CAD-CAM onlays. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two mesio-occlusal buccal onlay preparations with reduction of the mesiobuccal cusp were made: conventional preparation (CP) with a 1.2-mm modified shoulder margin and modified preparation (MP) flat cuspal reduction without shoulder. Virtual models were generated from each preparation by using a digital scanner (BlueCam; Dentsply Sirona) from the plastic teeth (direct digital scan) or from the stone dies (indirect digital scan). Onlays were designed using a CAD-CAM system (CEREC 4.0; Dentsply Sirona), and nanoceramic resin blocks (Lava Ultimate Restorative; 3M ESPE) were milled using the CEREC MCX milling machine. Marginal discrepancy was evaluated using an optical stereomicroscope at ×25 magnification in 18 locations distributed along the margins of the preparation. The data were analyzed by using 3-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey HSD test (α=.05). RESULTS: CP presented a statistically significant reduced average marginal adaptation (59 ±50 μm) than did MP (69 ±58 μm) (P<.001). The Tukey HSD test showed the presence of a significantly larger marginal discrepancy in the mesial and buccal locations of MP when compared with CP. Regarding impression techniques, the buccal location presented the smallest average marginal discrepancy in restorations fabricated with indirect impression when compared with direct impression (42 ±33 μm and 60 ±39 μm) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that conventional preparation with a modified shoulder margin presented improved marginal adaptation compared with modified preparation with flat cuspal reduction. Direct and indirect digital scanning techniques produced restorations within a clinically acceptable range; however, the indirect scanning technique resulted in the fabrication of restorations with superior marginal adaptation on the buccal location.",2018,1,0,
91, Comparison of mechanical properties of three machinable ceramics with an experimental fluorophlogopite glass ceramic,"B. T. Leung, J. K. Tsoi, J. P. Matinlinna and E. H. Pow", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Fluorophlogopite glass ceramic (FGC) is a biocompatible, etchable, and millable ceramic with fluoride releasing property. However, its mechanical properties and reliability compared with other machinable ceramics remain undetermined. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the mechanical properties of 3 commercially available millable ceramic materials, IPS e.max CAD, Vitablocs Mark II, and Vita Enamic, with an experimental FGC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Each type of ceramic block was sectioned into beams (n=15) of standard dimensions of 2×2×15 mm. Before mechanical testing, specimens of the IPS e.max CAD group were further fired for final crystallization. Flexural strength was determined by the 3-point bend test with a universal loading machine at a cross head speed of 1 mm/min. Hardness was determined with a hardness tester with 5 Vickers hardness indentations (n=5) using a 1.96 N load and a dwell time of 15 seconds. Selected surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Data were analyzed by the 1-way ANOVA test and Weibull analysis (α=.05). Weibull parameters, including the Weibull modulus (m) as well as the characteristic strength at 63.2% (η) and 10.0% (B10), were obtained. RESULTS: A significant difference in flexural strength (P<.001) was found among groups, with IPS e.max CAD (341.88 ±40.25 MPa)>Vita Enamic (145.95 ±12.65 MPa)>Vitablocs Mark II (106.67 ±18.50 MPa), and FGC (117.61 ±7.62 MPa). The Weibull modulus ranged from 6.93 to 18.34, with FGC showing the highest Weibull modulus among the 4 materials. The Weibull plot revealed that IPS e.max CAD>Vita Enamic>FGC>Vitablocs Mark II for the characteristic strength at both 63.2% (η) and 10.0% (B10). Significant difference in Vickers hardness among groups (P<.001) was found with IPS e.max CAD (731.63 ±30.64 H(V))>Vitablocs Mark II (594.74 ±25.22 H(V))>Vita Enamic (372.29 ±51.23 H(V))>FGC (153.74 ±23.62 H(V)). CONCLUSIONS: The flexural strength and Vickers hardness of IPS e.max CAD were significantly higher than those of the 3 materials tested. The FGC's flexural strength was comparable with Vitablocs Mark II. The FGC's Weibull modulus was the highest, while its Vickers hardness was the lowest among the materials tested.",2015,1,0,
49, Bonding effectiveness of tooth-colored materials to resin cement provided by self-etching silane primer after short- and long-term storage,F. Murillo-Gómez and M. F. De Goes, J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Glass-ceramic materials are typically treated with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and silane to improve their bond to composite resin; however, HF may be harmful to human tissues and the integrity of the material, and its application is a technique-sensitive procedure. A novel self-etching ceramic primer has been introduced with the claim that it can solve those problems. However, independent scientific evidence regarding its performance is scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of self-etching silane primer on glass-ceramic surface roughness and on long-term bonding between glass-ceramic and composite resin cement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plates of 3 materials (n=10), lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LDC) (IPS e.max CAD), leucite-based glass-ceramic (LEU) (IPS Empress CAD), and resin-modified ceramic (PIC) (VITA ENAMIC), were treated in the following ways: no treatment (C), HF (5%) applied during the recommended time for each material (HF), and self-etching ceramic primer (Monobond Etch & Prime [MBEP]). Surface roughness (Sa) was analyzed with a laser 3D profiler. Ceramic sticks were subjected to (n=20) no treatment (C); treatment with hydrofluoric acid plus silane (HF+S); and treatment with self-etching ceramic primer (MBEP) bonded to prepolymerized composite resin sticks with composite resin cement (Variolink II) and stored for 24 hours and 1 year (n=10). The assemblies were submitted to microtensile bond strength testing (μTBS). Data were analyzed using ANOVA and the Tukey pairwise, post hoc test (α=.05). Failure pattern and surface and interface morphology were assessed using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Only individual factors resulted in statistically significant differences for both variables (material: P<.001; surface treatment: P=.020), interaction (P=.570). HF group (0.49 ±0.11 μm) showed statistically higher roughness values (P≤.05) than control groups (0.44 ±0.97 μm), while MBEP (0.48 ±0.11 μm) was comparable with both. HF produced greater surface alterations than MBEP and C. PIC (0.60 ±0.051 μm) exhibited significantly higher roughness values (P≤.05) than LDC (0.37 ±0.07 μm) and LEU (0.45 ±0.04). Regarding μTBS, the general mean of PIC (24.6 ±10.1 MPa) was higher (P≤.05) than LEUs (14.7 ±6.7 MPa) and LDCs (13.1 ±4.8 MPa), while treatment groups HF+S (17.9 ±10.0 MPa) and MBEP (20.5 ±9.7 MPa) produced higher μTBS values than control groups (14.2 ±5.5 MPa). Adhesive failure was associated with low μTBS values and aged specimens, while cohesive failure within the composite resin-cement layer and mixed failures were associated with higher μTBS values. Interface debonding was detected in C groups for LDC and LEU. PIC exhibited better interface stability. CONCLUSIONS: MBEP produced smoother surfaces than HF. HF+S and MBEP significantly improved ceramic and composite resin cement bonding.",2019,1,0,
319, Influence of simulated gastric juice on surface characteristics of CAD-CAM monolithic materials,"M. E. M. Cruz, R. Simões, S. B. Martins, F. Z. Trindade, L. N. Dovigo and R. G. Fonseca", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: How the surfaces of monolithic esthetic restorations behave in the presence of acidic substances is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of simulated gastric juice on roughness, morphology, microhardness, substance loss, and color change of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) monolithic materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Disks from Lava Ultimate, VITA ENAMIC, IPS e.max CAD, and VITA SUPRINITY were analyzed for roughness, morphology, and microhardness by using a confocal microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Vickers hardness tester. Substance loss was determined by weighing the specimens on an analytical balance, and color change (ΔE) was assessed by using a spectrophotometer based on the CIELab parameters. All analyses were carried out before and after acid exposure. RESULTS: Acid exposure significantly decreased the roughness, having a very high effect size on this property. The material was highly decisive in determining the microhardness, presenting the following order: VITA SUPRINITY>IPS e.max CAD>VITA ENAMIC>Lava Ultimate. The mass was not significantly affected by the acidic challenge. No significant difference in ΔE was found between Lava Ultimate and VITA ENAMIC and between IPS e.max CAD and VITA SUPRINITY. Lava Ultimate showed a higher ΔE than IPS e.max CAD and VITA SUPRINITY, whereas VITA ENAMIC exhibited higher ΔE only when compared with VITA SUPRINITY. All materials presented ΔE<1. CONCLUSIONS: The simulated gastric juice significantly influenced the roughness of all the evaluated materials and promoted a color change classified as clinically undetectable in all materials.",2020,0,0,
315, Influence of remaining tooth structure and restorative material type on stress distribution in endodontically treated maxillary premolars: A finite element analysis,"J. Zhu, Q. Rong, X. Wang and X. Gao", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: How tooth preparation and material type affect the stress distribution of endodontically treated teeth restored with endocrowns remains unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this finite element (FE) study was to determine the influence of the quantity of remaining dental tissues and material type on stress distribution in endodontically treated maxillary premolars using 3-dimensional FE analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five 3-dimensional FE models were constructed on the basis of the restorative methods used and the quantity of preserved tooth tissues: a sound maxillary premolar, an endodontically treated maxillary premolar restored with composite resin, and endodontically treated maxillary premolars restored with endocrowns with thicknesses of 1.0 mm, 2.0 mm, and 3.0 mm. The following endocrown materials were used: Paradigm MZ100, IPS Empress, IPS e.max CAD, and In-Ceram Zirconia. Stress distributions were analyzed under vertical and oblique loads. RESULTS: As the quantity of preserved dental tissues increased, the von Mises stress in dentin decreased, and the peak von Mises strain value of the cement layer increased. When the elastic modulus of the endocrown material increased, the von Mises stress in endocrown and dentin increased, and the peak von Mises strain value of the cement layer decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Although the conservative preparation of teeth for endocrowns is likely to protect the residual tooth structure, it may cause future cohesive bonding failure. An increase in the elastic modulus of the material may benefit the durability of bonding between the endocrown and the abutment tooth; however, it may cause fracture of the residual tooth structure.",2017,0,0,
36, Assessment of reliability of CAD-CAM tooth-colored implant custom abutments,"N. M. Guilherme, K. H. Chung, B. D. Flinn, C. Zheng and A. J. Raigrodski", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Information is lacking about the fatigue resistance of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) tooth-colored implant custom abutment materials. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the reliability of different types of CAD-CAM tooth-colored implant custom abutments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Zirconia (Lava Plus), lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD), and resin-based composite (Lava Ultimate) abutments were fabricated using CAD-CAM technology and bonded to machined titanium-6 aluminum-4 vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V) alloy inserts for conical connection implants (NobelReplace Conical Connection RP 4.3×10 mm; Nobel Biocare). Three groups (n=19) were assessed: group ZR, CAD-CAM zirconia/Ti-6Al-4V bonded abutments; group RC, CAD-CAM resin-based composite/Ti-6Al-4V bonded abutments; and group LD, CAD-CAM lithium disilicate/Ti-6Al-4V bonded abutments. Fifty-seven implant abutments were secured to implants and embedded in autopolymerizing acrylic resin according to ISO standard 14801. Static failure load (n=5) and fatigue failure load (n=14) were tested. Weibull cumulative damage analysis was used to calculate step-stress reliability at 150-N and 200-N loads with 2-sided 90% confidence limits. Representative fractured specimens were examined using stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy to observe fracture patterns. RESULTS: Weibull plots revealed β values of 2.59 for group ZR, 0.30 for group RC, and 0.58 for group LD, indicating a wear-out or cumulative fatigue pattern for group ZR and load as the failure accelerating factor for groups RC and LD. Fractographic observation disclosed that failures initiated in the interproximal area where the lingual tensile stresses meet the compressive facial stresses for the early failure specimens. Plastic deformation of titanium inserts with fracture was observed for zirconia abutments in fatigue resistance testing. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly higher reliability was found in group ZR, and no significant differences in reliability were determined between groups RC and LD. Differences were found in the failure characteristics of group ZR between static and fatigue loading.",2016,0,1,
519, Translucency of esthetic dental restorative CAD/CAM materials and composite resins with respect to thickness and surface roughness,"D. Awad, B. Stawarczyk, A. Liebermann and N. Ilie", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Little information is available about the translucency of monolithic CAD/CAM materials. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the translucency of restorative CAD/CAM materials and direct composite resins with respect to thickness and surface roughness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 240 disk-shaped specimens (12×14×1 mm and 12×14×2 mm) of 3 different CAD/CAM glass ceramics (CELTRA Duo, IPS e.max CAD, IPS Empress CAD), a fine-structure feldspathic ceramic (VITA Mark II), a hybrid ceramic (VITA Enamic), a resin nanoceramic composite resin (LAVA Ultimate), an experimental (CAD/CAM nanohybrid composite resin), 2 interim materials (Telio CAD; VITA CAD-Temp), and 3 direct composite resins (Tetric EvoCeram; Filtek Supreme XTE; Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill) were fabricated (n=10). After 3 different surface pretreatments (polished, rough SiC P1200, or SiC P500), absolute translucency and surface roughness were measured using spectrophotometry and tactile profilometry. The influence of material type, thickness, and roughness on absolute translucency was analyzed using a multivariate analysis, 1-way ANOVA, and the Tukey HSD post hoc test (P<.05). Pearson correlations and statistical hypothesis tests were used to assess the results (P<.05). RESULTS: The effect of all tested parameters was significant among the materials (P<.05). The greatest influence on the measured translucency was thickness (partial eta squared ηP²=.988), closely followed by material (.982), and the pretreatment method (.835). The surface roughness was strongly influenced by the pretreatment method (.975) and type of material (.941). CONCLUSION: Thickness and surface roughness are major factors affecting the absolute translucency of adhesively luted restorations.",2015,1,1,
304, Influence of low-temperature degradation on the wear characteristics of zirconia against polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network material,"Z. Hao, Y. Ma, W. Liu, Y. Meng, K. Nakamura, J. Shen and H. Wang", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Low-temperature degradation may affect zirconia restorations during their clinical service. Concerns have been raised about the effect of low-temperature degradation on the wear behavior of zirconia. Moreover, the wear resistance of this novel polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network material needs to be better evaluated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of aging on the wear resistance of zirconia opposing polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve specimens for 2 newly developed polymer-based materials (a polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network material VITA ENAMIC and a resin nanocomposite material Lava Ultimate), 2 commonly used glass-ceramic materials (IPS e.max CAD and VITABLOCS Mark II), and 2 conventional composite resin materials (VITA CAD-Temp and PMMA Disk) were tested; human enamel was used as a control group. The wear simulator used was a ball-on-disk type with zirconia balls, with and without autoclaving (134°C, 200 kPa, 20 hours) as antagonists. The vertical loss and volume loss of specimens and the roughness average of zirconia antagonists were measured with a 3-dimensional optical profilometer. Vickers hardness values were determined using a micro-Vickers hardness tester. Data were statistically analyzed with a mixed-model ANOVA for wear loss (vertical loss [μm] and volume loss [mm(3)]) and roughness average (μm) of zirconia antagonists and with the Kruskal-Wallis test for Vickers hardness values (α=.05). The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between wear loss and hardness. RESULTS: Results showed that specimens opposing the non-aged zirconia balls demonstrated significantly higher wear than those opposing the aged ones (P<.001). The polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network material VITA ENAMIC group (vertical loss=27.44-33.53 μm, volume loss=0.0198-0.315 mm(3)) and the resin nanocomposite material Lava Ultimate group (vertical loss=24.42-27.83 μm, volume loss=0.0159-0.0233 mm(3)) showed lower vertical loss and volume loss than the conventional composite resin groups (vertical loss=43.95-61.87 μm, volume loss=0.0395-0.0593 mm(3)) but higher wear than the glass-ceramic groups (IPS e.max CAD and VITABLOCS Mark II; vertical loss=8.95-11.47 μm, volume loss=0.0072-0.0094 mm(3)) and human enamel (vertical loss=9.95-12.32 μm; volume loss=0.0089-0.0103 mm(3)). The aged zirconia antagonists indicated greater roughness average values than the aged zirconia balls after the wear test (P<.001). Distinct abrasion-induced tracks were observed on the contact surfaces of the aged zirconia antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: Even though zirconia ceramic subjected to low-temperature degradation exhibited increased roughness after the wear test, it was still nonabrasive toward opposing materials. The polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network material showed intermediate wear resistance compared with glass-ceramic and conventional composite resin.",2018,1,1,
373, Microleakage of thin-walled monolithic zirconia and polymer-containing CAD-CAM crowns,"M. A. Schlenz, C. Fiege, A. Schmidt and B. Wöstmann", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Monolithic restorations facilitate computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) processability and provide thin-walled restorations, which require less tooth reduction. For the long-term success of these restorations, their durable sealing is important. However, data in this regard are sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the microleakage of monolithic complete crowns made from current CAD-CAM materials after mastication simulation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-four identical test specimens (crown and tooth) were milled based on corresponding standard tessellation language data sets: one for the crowns and another for the human molar teeth. Four CAD-CAM restoration materials were investigated: 2 polymer-containing materials, Brilliant Crios (BC) and Vita Enamic (VE), and 2 zirconia materials, ultra-high-translucent Nacera Pearl Q³ Multi-Shade (ultraHT) and high-translucent Nacera Pearl Multi-Shade (HT). The crowns were adhesively luted to the CAD-CAM milled human molars with 1 of 3 luting systems: OneCoat7Universal and DuoCem (BC); A.R.T.Bond and DuoCement (VE); or EDPrimer/Panavia F2.0 (ultraHT and HT). The specimens were divided in 2 subgroups, and 2 different mastication simulations were applied: normal function (NF) and bruxism (B). A dye penetration test was used to detect microleakage, and the specimens were sectioned. A digital microscope (Zeiss) was used for analysis and to calculate the percentage of leakage in relation to the height of the tooth. Data were subjected to the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests (α=.05). RESULTS: Microleakage was identified in all groups. VE reported the highest leakage with a mean of 13.0%, followed by ultraHT (4.8%), HT (3.6%), and BC (3.0%). No significant difference was detected between the 2 simulation programs (normal function and bruxism). However, VE and the zirconia group HT exhibited a significant difference (P<.014), whereas no significant difference was noted among the zirconia groups or the polymer-containing groups BC and VE. CONCLUSIONS: Thin-walled restorations made of CAD-CAM composite resin and zirconia exhibited reduced microleakage compared with the polymer-containing ceramic. Thus, from the specific viewpoint of microleakage, CAD-CAM composite resins and zirconia seem to be suitable materials for thin-walled complete crowns.",2021,1,1,
42, Bond strength of CAD-CAM and conventional veneering materials to different frameworks,"F. Wiedenmann, M. Klören, D. Edelhoff and B. Stawarczyk", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: New materials and precise manufacturing processes allow for new processes in the veneering and production of fixed dental prostheses. However, data on the bond strength of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) and conventional veneering materials to substrates bonded with different composite resins are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the shear bond strength (SBS) of 2 CAD-CAM, Lava Ultimate (LVU) and VITABLOCS Mark II (VMII), and 3 conventional veneering materials (VM9, VM13, VTI) to 3 different substrates: zirconia (ZIR), cobalt-chromium (CC), and titanium (TIT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Substrates and veneering cylinders were manufactured and bonded by using 3 different composite resins, RelyX Unicem (RUL), RelyX Ultimate (RXU), and Sinfony (SIN), after various pretreatments (n=18). Half the specimens underwent artificial aging before SBS testing, and failure types were analyzed. Univariate 1-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U were computed (α=.05). RESULTS: CC substrates bonded with RUL showed the highest SBS (P=.007). ZIR substrates bonded with RXU presented higher SBS than TIT substrates (P=.007). ZIR substrates bonded with SIN showed higher SBS than CC substrates (P<.001). SIN veneered groups showed lower SBS than that observed for VM9/13/VTI (P<.001). SIN veneered LVU and VMII substrates presented lower SBS (P<.001). Thermocycling led to a reduction in SBS for most groups (P=.001-.022). SIN veneered substrates and RXU veneered VMII substrates resulted in lower SBS than that seen for VM9/13/VTI and veneered ZIR substrates bonded with SIN or RXU (P<.001). Adhesive failures were most common. CONCLUSIONS: While RUL is capable of forming a stable bond to CC without pretreatment, ZIR substrates achieve higher SBS after conditioning with an MDP-containing primer when using RXU or SIN than that seen for RUL. Pretreated CAD-CAM-veneered ZIR substrates bonded with SIN or RXU led to similar SBS results to those observed for conventional veneers, while veneering with SIN resulted in lower SBS.",2021,0,1,
408, Physicomechanical characterization of polyetheretherketone and current esthetic dental CAD/CAM polymers after aging in different storage media,"A. Liebermann, T. Wimmer, P. R. Schmidlin, H. Scherer, P. Löffler, M. Roos and B. Stawarczyk", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) can be used to support fixed dental prostheses. However, information about physicomechanical characterization is still scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess effects of different aging regimens/durations on roughness, solubility, water absorption, Martens hardness (HM), and indentation modulus/EIT on different computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) polymers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty standardized specimens of the following materials were fabricated: PEEK: Dentokeep (DK); hybrid material: VITA Enamic (EN); composite resins: LAVA Ultimate (LU) and an experimental CAD/CAM nanohybrid-composite resin (EX); poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-based: VITA CAD-Temp (CT); Telio CAD (TC), artBloc Temp (AT), and ZENOTEC ProFix (ZP). A nanofilled-polymer for interim restorations, Protemp 4 (CG), served as the control group. Specimens were stored in sodium chloride, artificial saliva, physiological saliva, and distilled water at 37°C for 1, 7, 14, 28, 90, and 180 days. Roughness, water absorption, HM, and EIT were investigated after each storage period; solubility was determined after 180 days only. Data were analyzed using weighted 3/2/1-way ANOVA and the post hoc Scheffé tests (α=.05). RESULTS: Storage media had no effect on surface roughness and water absorption. Physiological saliva revealed the highest significant impact on solubility followed by artificial saliva, sodium chloride, and distilled water. Water absorption increased significantly with storage duration. PEEK showed the lowest solubility and water absorption values. The highest solubility was observed for the conventional polymer CG, and the highest water absorption was found for the composite LU. PMMA-based TC, ZP, CG, and AT showed the lowest HM and indentation modulus, followed by CT, and PEEK. The highest values were observed for the hybrid material EN, followed by LU and EX. CONCLUSIONS: The hardness parameters of PEEK were comparable with those of PMMA-based materials.",2016,0,1,
363, Mechanical properties and internal fit of 4 CAD-CAM block materials,"A. Goujat, H. Abouelleil, P. Colon, C. Jeannin, N. Pradelle, D. Seux and B. Grosgogeat", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Recent polymer-based computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials have been commercialized for inlay restorations, a polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) and composite resin nanoceramics. Little independent evidence regarding their mechanical properties exists. Internal adaptation is an important factor for the clinical success and longevity of a restoration, and data concerning this parameter for inlays made with these blocks are scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate and compare the mechanical properties (flexural strength, flexural modulus, Vickers hardness, fracture toughness) and the internal adaptation of these recent polymer-based blocks with a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic block. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The materials tested in this study were a PICN material (Vita Enamic), 2 composite resin nanoceramics (Lava Ultimate; 3M ESPE and Cerasmart; GCDental Products), and a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD). Mechanical properties were evaluated according to ISO norm DIS 6872:2013. Bar-shaped specimens (18×3×3 mm) were prepared and submitted to a 3-point bend test using a universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min. In addition, identical cavities were prepared in 60 human mandibular extracted molars (n=15) and optically scanned to receive mesioocclusodistal inlays milled with the 4 materials tested in a CEREC Inlab milling machine. The replica technique and a stereomicroscope (×20) were used to measure the internal fit of the inlays at 9 preselected locations. All data were statistically analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and the post hoc Tukey multiple comparison or Games-Howell test (α=.05). RESULTS: The mean flexural strength of the tested blocks ranged from 148.7 ±9.5 MPa (Vita Enamic) to 216.5 ±28.3 MPa (Cerasmart). The mean flexural modulus ranged from 23.3 ±6.4 GPa (Vita Enamic) to 52.8 ±10.5 GPa (IPS e.max CAD). The mean Vickers hardness ranged from 0.66 ±0.02 GPa (Cerasmart) to 5.98 ±0.69 GPa (IPS e.max CAD). The mean fracture toughness ranged from 1.2 ±0.17 MPa.m(1/2) (Cerasmart) to 1.8 ±0.29 MPa.m(1/2) (IPS e.max CAD). The values for internal discrepancy ranged from 119 ±55 μm to 234 ±51 μm. The mean internal discrepancy was significantly higher for Lava Ultimate (P<.05) than IPS e.max CAD and Cerasmart but not for Vita Enamic. The factor ''material'' was statistically significant in relation to the mechanical properties evaluated in this study (P<.05). The Pearson correlation was negative between the flexural strength results and the internal discrepancy of the materials tested (R(2)=0.941; P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The mechanical properties of the CAD-CAM block materials tested were within the acceptable range for fabrication of single restorations according to the ISO standard for ceramics (ISO 6872:2008). IPS e.max CAD and Cerasmart were observed to have superior flexural strength and better internal fit.",2018,1,1,
130, Effect of different CAD-CAM materials on the marginal and internal adaptation of endocrown restorations: An in vitro study,"W. A. El Ghoul, M. Özcan, H. Ounsi, H. Tohme and Z. Salameh", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Recent resin-based and ceramic-based computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials have been used to restore endodontically treated teeth. Adaptation of the restoration is important for clinical success, but studies evaluating the effect of these materials on the adaptation of endocrowns are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of resin-based and ceramic-based materials on the marginal and internal adaptation of endocrowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty mandibular molars were divided into 4 groups (n=10); each group was restored with a different CAD-CAM material: group C: hybrid nanoceramic (Cerasmart; GC Corp), group T: fiber-composite material (Trilor; Bioloren Srl), group E: lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD; Ivoclar Vivadent AG), and group V: zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (Vita Suprinity; VITA Zahnfabrik GmbH). A digital scan was made with an intraoral digital scanner (TRIOS 3; 3Shape A/S), and endocrowns were milled with a 5-axis milling machine (Coritec 250i; imes-icore GmbH). The replica technique and a stereomicroscope (×70) were used to measure the marginal and internal adaptation of the endocrowns at 32 points. All data were statistically analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and the Tukey honestly significant difference test (α=.05). RESULTS: Statistical tests showed significant differences among the tested groups (P<.001). The resin-based groups displayed larger discrepancies than the ceramic-based groups. The resin-based groups showed a mean marginal gap larger than the mean internal gap C (P=.009), T (P<.001), whereas the ceramic-based groups showed similar gaps, V (P=.396), E (P=.936). The largest gap was observed at the pulpal floor (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: All materials had clinically acceptable internal and marginal gaps (≤150 μm), except for the marginal gap of the Trilor group.",2020,1,0,
160, Effect of supporting substrate on the failure behavior of a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network material,"J. C. Facenda, M. Borba, P. Benetti, A. Della Bona and P. H. Corazza", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Restorative materials are cemented on different types of substrates, such as dentin, metal, and glass-fiber posts with composite resin cores. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the failure behavior after cycling fatigue of a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network material (PICN; VITA ENAMIC) cemented on different supporting substrates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PICN plates (N=80) were obtained from computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM) blocks and cemented with a resin cement to 4 different supporting substrates (n=20): (1) human dentin (PICNDen); (2) dentin analog (PICNDenAn); (3) nickel-chromium alloy (PICNNiCr); and (4) composite resin plus fiberglass post (PICNRc). For comparison, the fracture behavior of a feldspathic ceramic (FelDenAn; VITABLOCS Mark II) and an indirect composite resin (ResDenAn; Opallis LAB Resin) cemented to the DenAn substrate was investigated (n=20). Thus, specimens were composed of the restorative material layer (1-mm thick) resin cemented (0.1-mm-thick layer) to a 2-mm-thick supporting substrate. All specimens were subjected to mechanical cycling (MC) using a pneumatic cycling machine (500 000 cycles, 2 Hz, 50 N). Specimens that did not fracture during cycling were tested under compression using a universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min until the sound of the first crack was detected using an acoustic system. Failure data were statistically evaluated using Weibull distribution. Failures were classified as radial crack, cone crack, combined, and catastrophic fracture. RESULTS: All FelDenAn specimens were fractured during MC. Only 4 PICNRc specimens survived MC, so their fracture load data were not statistically analyzed. PICNNiCr showed the greatest characteristic load (L(0)) value, followed by ResDenAn. Groups PICNDenAn and PICNDen showed lower and similar L(0) but statistically different Weibull modulus (m). There was a significant relationship between experimental group and failure mode (P<.001). FelDenAn and PICNRc had a higher frequency of radial cracks, whereas PICNNiCr failed from cone cracking. CONCLUSIONS: The supporting substrate influenced the failure behavior of PICN. When the substrate had a higher elastic modulus than the restorative material, better mechanical behavior was observed.",2019,1,0,
154, Effect of saliva contamination and artificial aging on different primer/cement systems bonded to zirconia,"J. Pitta, T. C. Branco and J. Portugal", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Saliva contamination has been shown to decrease bonding to zirconia. Adopting a less contamination-sensitive cement system may be an alternative to decontamination. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess the ability of different primer/cement systems to promote a durable bond to zirconia after saliva contamination. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Zirconia blocks (Lava Plus) (N=320) were airborne-particle abraded (50 μm Al(2)O(3)) and divided into 32 experimental groups (n=10) according to the variables in the study: saliva contamination; primer/cement system (Panavia SA [PSA]; RelyX Unicem 2 [RU2]; Bifix SE [BSE]; Panavia F2.0 [PF2]; Scotchbond Universal + RelyX Ultimate [SBU+RXU]; Futurabond M+ + Bifix QM [FBM+BQM]; All-Bond Universal + Duo-link [ABU+DL]; Z-Prime Plus + Duo-link [ZPP+DL]; and aging period (72 hours; 30 days with 10 000 thermocycles at 5°C to 55°C). After half of the blocks had been contaminated with fresh human saliva for 10 minutes, rinsed with water, and air-dried, each primer/cement was applied. Polymerized composite resin disks were then placed over the cement, and the resin cement was light-polymerized for 20 seconds each at 2 opposite margins. After the aging time, the specimens were tested in shear (1 mm/min). The failure mode was classified as adhesive, cohesive, or mixed. Statistical analysis of the shear bond strength (SBS) data was performed with ANOVA followed by Tukey honest significant difference post hoc tests. Chi-square tests were used to analyze the failure mode data (α=.05). RESULTS: The mean SBS ranged between 4.2 and 34.5 MPa. Shear bond strength was influenced (P<.001) by all the factors studied (cement system, saliva contamination, aging time). SBU+RXU and FBM+BQM showed a higher mean SBS than those of the other experimental groups (P<.05) and were the only groups not affected by saliva contamination (P>.05). Failure was predominantly classified as adhesive. CONCLUSIONS: In general, saliva contamination and aging decreased bonding efficacy. Two systems, combining an application of a universal adhesive and a resin cement (SBU+RXU and FBM+BQM) were not affected by saliva contamination.",2018,0,0,
481, Survival rate and load to failure of premolars restored with inlays: An evaluation of different inlay fabrication methods,"M. Pivetta Rippe, C. Monaco, T. Missau, V. F. Wandscher, L. Volpe, R. Scotti, M. A. Bottino and L. F. Valandro", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Studies that evaluate the survival rate and load to fracture of premolars restored with inlays produced using different methods are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the survival rate and fracture load of premolars restored with inlays fabricated using different methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty maxillary premolars were selected, embedded, and prepared to receive inlays fabricated using different methods (n=10): LaCom-digital scanning with Lava C.O.S. scanner (3M ESPE), followed by milling of composite resin block (Lava Ultimate; 3M ESPE) in a milling unit; CeCom-digital scanning with Cerec 3D Bluecam scanner (Dentsply Sirona), followed by milling of a Lava Ultimate block in Cerec (Dentsply Sirona); PresDis-impression with polyvinyl siloxane, inlay made using the lost wax technique, and IPS e.max Press (Ivoclar Vivadent AG) pressed ceramic (lithium disilicate). A dual-polymerizing resin cement system was used to lute the inlays. Inlays were mechanically cycled (2 Hz, 10(6) mechanical pulses, 80 N) after 24 hours, and the specimens were stored in distilled water at 37°C for 11 months. Then, a fatigue test was conducted using a 10-Hz frequency and 400-N load on the inner inclines of the cusps. The test was complete when the specimen fractured or when the specimen reached 1.5×10(6) cycles. The specimens that survived fatigue testing were submitted to a single-load fracture test in a universal testing machine and analyzed using a stereoscope for failure classification. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test (Mantel-Cox). Fracture load data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA (α=.05). RESULTS: No significant differences were detected among the groups for the survival rate (P=.87) or for the load to fracture (P=.78). Most failures were longitudinal, catastrophic fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Premolars restored with inlays fabricated using the tested methods had similar survival rates and loads to fracture.",2019,0,1,
281, In vitro evaluation of the marginal integrity of CAD/CAM interim crowns,"K. Y. Kelvin Khng, R. L. Ettinger, S. R. Armstrong, T. Lindquist, D. G. Gratton and F. Qian", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The accuracy of interim crowns made with computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems has not been well investigated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the marginal integrity of interim crowns made by CAD/CAM compared with that of conventional polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) crowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A dentoform mandibular left second premolar was prepared for a ceramic crown and scanned for the fabrication of 60 stereolithical resin dies, half of which were scanned to fabricate 15 Telio CAD-CEREC and 15 Paradigm MZ100-E4D-E4D crowns. Fifteen Caulk and 15 Jet interim crowns were made on the remaining resin dies. All crowns were cemented with Tempgrip under a 17.8-N load, thermocycled for 1000 cycles, placed in 0.5% acid fuschin for 24 hours, and embedded in epoxy resin before sectioning from the mid-buccal to mid-lingual surface. The marginal discrepancy was measured using a traveling microscope, and dye penetration was measured as a percentage of the overall length under the crown. RESULTS: The mean vertical marginal discrepancy of the conventionally made interim crowns was greater than for the CAD/CAM crowns (P=.006), while no difference was found for the horizontal component (P=.276). The mean vertical marginal discrepancy at the facial surface of the Caulk crowns was significantly greater than that of the other 3 types of interim crowns (P<.001). At the facial margin, the mean horizontal component of the Telio crowns was significantly larger than that of the other 3 types, with no difference at the lingual margins (P=.150). The mean percentage dye penetration for the Paradigm MZ100-E4D crowns was significantly greater and for Jet crowns significantly smaller than for the other 3 crowns (P<.001). However, the mean percentage dye penetration was significantly correlated with the vertical and horizontal marginal discrepancies of the Jet interim crowns at the facial surface and with the horizontal marginal discrepancies of the Caulk interim crowns at the lingual surface (P<.01 in each instance). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly smaller vertical marginal discrepancy was found with the interim crowns fabricated by CAD/CAM as compared with PMMA crowns; however, this difference was not observed for the horizontal component. The percentage dye penetration was correlated with vertical and horizontal discrepancies at the facial surface for the Jet interim crowns and with horizontal discrepancies at the lingual surface for the Caulk interim crowns.",2016,0,0,
200, Evaluation of marginal and internal adaptation of hybrid and nanoceramic systems with microcomputed tomography: An in vitro study,"G. Yildirim, I. H. Uzun and A. Keles", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The accuracy of recently introduced chairside computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) blocks is not well established, and marginal integrity and internal adaptation are not known. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the marginal and internal adaptation of hybrid and nanoceramics using microcomputed tomography (μ-CT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The marginal and internal adaptation of 3 polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) materials (Vita Enamic [VE]; Lava Ultimate [LU]; Vita Suprinity [VS]) were compared with lithium disilicate (IPS e.max.CAD, IPS). Ninety-six specimens (48 dies and 48 crowns) were prepared (n=12 each group) using a chairside CAD-CAM system. The restorations were scanned with μ-CT, with 160 measurements made for each crown, and used in 2-dimensional (2D) analysis. The marginal adaptation of marginal discrepancy (MD), absolute marginal discrepancy (AMD), internal adaptation of shoulder area (SA), axial space (AS), and occlusal space (OS) were compared using appropriate statistical analysis methods (α=.05). Cement volumes were compared using 3D analysis. RESULTS: The IPS blocks showed higher MD (130 μm), AMD (156 μm), SA (111 μm) (P<.05), AS (52 μm), and OS (192 μm) than the other blocks (P<.01). The adaptation values of VS were significantly lower than those of the IPS block (P<.05). The adaption values of the LU and VE blocks were significantly lower than those of others (P<.01) but were statistically similar to one another (P>.05). IPS had the largest cement space at 18 mm(3) (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: The marginal and internal adaptation values were within a clinically acceptable range for all 3 hybrids and nanoceramics tested.",2017,1,0,
294, Influence of cement type and ceramic primer on retention of polymer-infiltrated ceramic crowns to a one-piece zirconia implant,"N. Rohr, S. Brunner, S. Märtin and J. Fischer", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The best procedure for cementing a restoration to zirconia implants has not yet been established. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to measure the retention of polymer-infiltrated ceramic crowns to zirconia 1-piece implants using a wide range of cements. The effect of ceramic primer treatment on the retention force was also recorded. The retention results were correlated with the shear bond strength of the cement to zirconia and the indirect tensile strength of the cements to better understand the retention mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retention test was performed using 100 polymer-infiltrated ceramic crowns (Vita Enamic) and zirconia implants (ceramic.implant CI) The crowns were cemented with either interim cement (Harvard Implant semipermanent, Temp Bond), glass-ionomer cement (Ketac Cem), self-adhesive cement (Perma Cem 2.0, RelyX Unicem Automix 2, Panavia SA), or adhesive cement (Multilink Implant, Multilink Automix, Vita Adiva F-Cem, RelyX Ultimate, Panavia F 2.0, Panavia V5 or Panavia 21) (n=5). Additionally ceramic primer was applied on the intaglio crown surface and implant abutment before cementation for all adhesive cements (Multilink Implant, Multilink Automix: Monobond plus; RelyX Ultimate Scotchbond Universal; Vita Adiva F-Cem: Vita Adiva Zr-Prime; Panavia F2.0, Panavia V5: Clearfil Ceramic Primer) and 1 self-adhesive cement containing 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) (Panavia SA: Clearfil Ceramic Primer). Crown debond fracture patterns were recorded. Shear bond strength was determined for the respective cement groups to polished zirconia (n=6). The diametral tensile strength of the cements was measured (n=10). Statistical analysis was performed using 1-way or 2-way analysis of variance followed by the Fisher LSD test (α=.05) within each test parameter. RESULTS: Adhesive and self-adhesive resin cements had shear bond strength values of 0.0 to 5.3 MPa and revealed similar retention forces. Cements containing MDP demonstrated shear bond strength values above 5.3 MPa and displayed increased retention. The highest retention values were recorded for Panavia F 2.0 (318 ±28 N) and Panavia 21 (605 ±82 N). All other adhesive and self-adhesive resin cements attained retention values between 222 ±16 N (Multilink Automix) and 270 ±26 N (Panavia SA), which were significantly higher (P<.05) than glass-ionomer (Ketac Cem: 196 ±34 N) or interim cement (Harvard Implant semipermanent: 43 ±6 N, Temp Bond: 127 ±13 N). Application of manufacturer-specific ceramic primer increased crown retention significantly only for Panavia SA. CONCLUSIONS: Products containing MDP provided a high chemical bond to zirconia. Self-adhesive and adhesive resin cements with low chemical bonding capabilities to zirconia provided retention force values within a small range (220 to 290 N).",2018,1,0,
131, Effect of different cement systems and aging on the bond strength of chairside CAD-CAM ceramics,S. Ustun and E. A. Ayaz, J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The bond strength of different chairside computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorative materials to dentin with different resin cements needs to be evaluated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of 3 different cementation systems after thermal aging on the shear bond strength of different CAD-CAM materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The occlusal surfaces of 63 molar teeth of similar size were removed, and 21 zirconia-reinforced lithium disilicate (Vita Suprinity-VS), 21 polymer infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic-VE), and 21 resin nanoceramic (GC Cerasmart-GC) rectangular specimens of 2.5 mm in thickness were obtained. The ceramics were cemented using total etch (TE), self-etch (SE), and self-adhesive (SA) cement systems. Half of the specimens were subjected to thermal aging with 5000 cycles. The shear bond strength test of all the specimens was measured. Fractured ceramic surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk test, 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Fisher Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests were used to analyze the shear bond strength test data (α=.05). RESULTS: The highest bond strength value was found in the nonthermal aged VS-TE and the lowest in the thermal aged VE-TE. Significant interaction was found between TE and SE cemented ceramics (P<.001). For specimens cemented with the SA system, significant interaction was found among ceramics with thermal aged specimens (P<.001). Thermal aging significantly decreased the mean bond strength (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in bond strength were observed in chairside CAD-CAM ceramics when cemented with TE, SE, and SA systems. Additionally, thermal aging significantly reduced the bond strength values of all the ceramic materials, regardless of the cementation procedure. Clinicians should consider these variables and choose the most suitable cementation systems for the material used.",2021,1,0,
77, Color change of CAD-CAM materials and composite resin cements after thermocycling,"I. Gürdal, A. Atay, M. Eichberger, E. Cal, A. Üsümez and B. Stawarczyk", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The color of resin cements and computer-aided-design and computer-aided-manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorations may change with aging. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to analyze the influence of thermocycling on the color of CAD-CAM materials with underlying resin cement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven different CAD-CAM materials, composite resins and glass-ceramics were cut into 0.7-mm and 1.2-mm thicknesses (n=10) and cemented with a dual-polymerizing resin cement, a light-polymerizing resin cement, and a preheated composite resin (N=420). Color values were measured by using spectrophotometry. Specimens were subjected to thermocycling (5°C and 55°C; 5000 cycles). The measured color difference (ΔE) data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. Normality of data distribution was tested by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Three-way and 1-way ANOVA followed by the Scheffé post hoc test and unpaired 2-sample Student t test were computed to determine the significant differences among the tested parameters (α=.05). RESULTS: ΔE values were significantly influenced by the CAD-CAM material (η(p)(2)=0.85, P<.001) and the resin composite cement (η(P)(2)=0.03, P=.003) but were not influenced by thickness (P=.179). Significant interactions were present among thickness, cement, and CAD-CAM materials (P<.001). Vita Suprinity and GC Cerasmart showed significantly the lowest ΔE values (P<.001). The highest ΔE values were observed for IPS Empress CAD. The dual-polymerizing resin cement showed significantly lower ΔE values than the preheated composite resin (P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: Restoration materials and composite resin cement types used for cementation influence the amount of color change due to aging.",2018,0,1,
80, Color stainability of CAD/CAM and nanocomposite resin materials,"O. Acar, B. Yilmaz, S. H. Altintas, I. Chandrasekaran and W. M. Johnston", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The color stainability of recently introduced computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) hybrid ceramic and resin nanoceramic is unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of coffee staining on the color of 3 different CAD/CAM restorative materials and a nanocomposite resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens from a hybrid dental ceramic (VITA Enamic), a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate), a lithium disilicate glass ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), and a nanocomposite resin (Filtek Supreme Ultra Universal) were evaluated for color change due to thermocycling in coffee (n=5). Specimens 0.5 to 0.7 mm and 1 to 1.2 mm in thickness were thermocycled for 5000 cycles. CIEDE2000 color differences (ΔE00) due to thermocycling in coffee were calculated using the color coordinates obtained from a spectroradiometer. ANCOVA was used to analyze the color differences among the materials with thickness as the covariate. Significant differences at average thickness were analyzed with the Tukey-Kramer test. RESULTS: For color difference due to staining, thickness was a significant covariate (P<.001). Regarding the analysis of color differences, every pair of the tested materials was significantly different (P<.001). Least squares means of color differences (ΔE00) at mean thickness were 4.34 for the nanohybrid composite resin, 3.66 for the resin nanoceramic, 1.35 for the hybrid ceramic, and 0.43 for the lithium disilicate ceramic. CONCLUSION: When exposed to hot and cold coffee, the color change was beyond clinical acceptability for the tested resin nanoceramic and nanocomposite resin materials. The average color change of the hybrid ceramic was clinically perceivable over the tested thickness values. The color change of lithium disilicate ceramic was not clinically perceivable at any tested thickness.",2016,1,0,
364, Mechanical properties of resin-ceramic CAD-CAM materials after accelerated aging,"C. Blackburn, H. Rask and A. Awada", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The development of polymer-based computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) milling bocks and the limited availability of independent studies on these materials make it pertinent to evaluate changes in their mechanical properties after simulated aging to identify strengths and limitations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to measure the effect of thermocycling on the flexural properties of ceramic, resin, and resin-ceramic CAD-CAM materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studied materials included Lava Ultimate Restorative (LVU; 3M ESPE), Enamic (ENA; VITA Zahnfabrik), Vitablocs Mark II (VM2; VITA Zahnfabrik), and Paradigm MZ100 (MZ1; 3M ESPE). Polished 4×1.2×14 mm bars (n=45 per material) were prepared from standard-size milling blocks. The 2 distilled water baths of the thermocycling apparatus were set to 5°C and 55°C, with a specimen immersion time of 15 seconds and transfer time of 4 seconds. Fifteen specimens from each material group were subjected to a 3-point flexural test at 3 different thermocycling intervals: 0 (control), 5000, and 10 000 cycles. The flexural test was performed over a 12-mm span with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data were subjected to multiple analyses of variance and the Tukey HSD post hoc tests (α=.05). RESULTS: Mean flexural strength values for 0, 5000, and 10 000 cycles were 133, 130, and 128 MPa for VM2; 175, 139, and 134 MPa for LVU; 154, 144, and 138 MPa for MZ1; and 149, 136, and 132 MPa for ENA. Mean flexural modulus values were 51, 52, and 54 GPa for VM2; 14, 13, and 13 GPa for LVU; 16, 15, and 15 GPa for MZ1; and 31, 30, and 31 GPa for ENA. Mean modulus of resilience values were 0.17, 0.16, and 0.15 MPa for VM2; 10.1, 0.76, and 0.72 MPa for LVU; 0.77, 0.69, and 0.62 MPa for MZ1; and 0.42, 0.31, and 0.28 MPa for ENA. A significant difference was found among the materials in the mean change of flexural strength (P<.001) and modulus of resilience (P<.05) after thermocycling. No significant difference was found among the materials in the mean change of flexural modulus after thermocycling (P=.113). CONCLUSIONS: The mean flexural strength of resin-ceramics is significantly different from that of the feldspathic ceramic control at 0 and 5000 cycles, but not at 10 000 cycles. The mean modulus of resilience of resin-ceramics varies significantly after thermocycling, unlike the feldspathic ceramic control. Conversely, the mean flexural modulus of tested materials did not vary significantly after thermocycling.",2018,1,0,
141, Effect of grinding and polishing on the roughness and fracture resistance of cemented CAD-CAM monolithic materials submitted to mechanical aging,"F. S. Ludovichetti, F. Z. Trindade, G. L. Adabo, L. Pezzato and R. G. Fonseca", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The effect of clinical adjustments on the strength of cemented computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) monolithic materials under aging challenge is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess the surface roughness and fracture resistance (with or without mechanical aging) of cemented CAD-CAM monolithic materials submitted to grinding and polishing procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Disks of Lava Ultimate, Vita Enamic, crystallized Vita Suprinity, and IPS e.max CAD were analyzed for roughness after polishing by using silicon carbide papers (Lava Ultimate and Vita Enamic) or glazing (IPS e.max CAD and Vita Suprinity) (control), after grinding by using 30-μm grit diamond rotary instruments, and after grinding and polishing by using a polishing kit. For fracture resistance, a simplified trilayer model consisting of a restorative disk, an epoxy resin disk, and a steel ring was used. The bonded trilayer disks received the same treatments described for the roughness analysis. Half of the specimens underwent mechanical aging for 1×10(6) cycles. All specimens were loaded until failure. The Weibull modulus was calculated. RESULTS: The IPS e.max CAD and Vita Suprinity showed the highest roughness after grinding and the lowest at baseline. For the Lava Ultimate and Vita Enamic, polishing provided lower roughness than at baseline. Grinding, followed or not by polishing, and mechanical aging did not adversely affect the fracture resistance or the reliability of the materials. CONCLUSIONS: Polishing did not recover the initial surface roughness of the glass-ceramic materials. Fracture resistance was not affected by grinding, followed or not by polishing, even after mechanical aging.",2019,1,0,
135, Effect of different resin cements and surface treatments on the shear bond strength of ceramic-glass polymer materials,"G. Alp, M. G. Subaşı, W. M. Johnston and B. Yilmaz", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The effect of different surface treatment techniques on the bond strength of different types of ceramic-glass polymer computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials and resin cements after aging is unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the surface roughness of different ceramic-glass polymer CAD-CAM materials after 2 different surface treatments and the effect of material, surface treatment, resin cement, and aging on bond strength. Additionally, it was to determine any correlation between the surface roughness and bond strength. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CAD-CAM ceramic-glass polymer materials, a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) (VITA ENAMIC), a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate), and a nanoparticle-filled resin (Cerasmart) (1.5 mm in thickness; n=144) were divided into 2 subgroups in terms of surface treatments: airborne-particle abraded or silica-coated. The surface roughness values of specimens were measured. Composite resin cylinders were prepared and bonded to the restorative specimens using 2 different types of resin cements (dual-polymerizing [DP] and light-polymerizing [LP]). Half of the specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 hours, while the other half were submitted to 5000 thermocycles. The shear bond strength was measured, and the failure modes of the specimens were evaluated. The data were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests (α=.05). The correlation between roughness and bond strength values was analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS: Material (P=.012) and surface treatment type (P=.031) significantly affected the surface roughness. For bond strength, significant interactions were found among the material type, surface treatment, resin cement, and aging factors (P=.009). No significant correlation was found between roughness and bond strength (P=.943). CONCLUSIONS: The surface treatment and resin cement type affected the bond strength and surface roughness of tested restorative materials. DP resin cement provided higher bond strength for airborne-particle abraded nanohybrid composite resin materials. LP resin cement achieved a higher bond strength when used with silica-coated, nanoparticle-filled resin and PICN materials.",2018,1,0,
166, Effect of surface treatment and glaze application on shade characterized resin-modified ceramic after toothbrushing,"J. P. M. Tribst, A. Maria de Oliveira Dal Piva, A. Werner, L. T. Sampaio Silva, L. C. Anami, M. A. Bottino and C. J. Kleverlaan", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The extrinsic characterization with pigments and glaze application on the surface of ceramic restorations promotes individualization and esthetics. However, whether this characterization is resistant to toothbrushing abrasive wear is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the abrasive wear resistance of characterized and glazed resin-modified ceramic with different surface treatments before characterization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty rectangular specimens (10×8×6 mm) were precision cut from Vita Enamic and randomly divided in 4 groups as per the surface treatment before the characterization technique. These groups included the following: no additional treatment or polishing only, acid etching, airborne-particle abrasion, and self-etching silanization. For each surface treatment, 2 subgroups were created considering the presence or absence of the glaze layer after shade characterization, totaling 8 groups (n=10). The specimens were submitted to toothbrushing simulation (150 000 cycles, 2.45-N, 180 strokes per minute) with a soft and straight toothbrush and a solution of toothpaste and distilled water (250 g/L). After each 50 000 cycles, the wear of the characterized surface was measured by using a contact profilometer in μm which was equivalent to 5, 10, and 15 years of simulated toothbrushing. The rates were analyzed by using 3-way ANOVA and the post hoc Tukey test (α=.05). Scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed to access the surface profile between the evaluated periods. RESULTS: The mean wear rate (Rz) of the characterized surface was affected by the isolated factors, including surface treatment, glaze, and time (P<.001), with no interactive effects noted. A higher mean value of Rz was observed for polishing only (12.9 ±4.4 μm), followed by airborne-particle abrasion (10.2 ±4.5 μm), acid etching (9.4 ±2.4 μm), and then self-etching silanization (7.6 ±2.9 μm). Mean wear rate was also increased by the glaze (11.1 ±4.7 μm) compared with its absence (9 ±3.2 μm) and by the length of time, with 15 years (11.3 ±4.5 μm) followed by 10 years (9.8 ±4.0 μm) and 5 years (9 ±3.6 μm). The scanning electron microscopy images showed similar worn surfaces for each subgroup, glaze removal after 150 000 cycles, and surface homogeneity in function of time. CONCLUSIONS: Self-etching silanization was found to be the treatment suitable for reducing the wear of characterized resin-modified ceramic during prolonged brushing of more than 5 years. Glaze application did not protect the characterization from surface wear, regardless of the ceramic surface treatment performed on the specimens.",2021,1,0,
361, Mechanical performance of implant-supported posterior crowns,"P. de Kok, C. J. Kleverlaan, N. de Jager, R. Kuijs and A. J. Feilzer", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The fracture of implant-supported restorations, especially of the veneering layer, is a common problem in dentistry. Monolithic ceramic or resin restorations might help solve this problem. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to obtain additional insight into the risk of fracture of implant-supported restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Identical crowns (n=10) of 10 different ceramic and composite resin materials were cemented on conventional abutments on implant replicas embedded in polymethyl methacrylate blocks. The specimens were subjected to compressive load in a universal testing machine to record initial load to failure (ILF). Additionally, the flexural strength (FS), compressive strength (CS), and elastic modulus (E) of the investigated materials were determined. These results were used in a finite element analysis model of a composite resin and a lithium disilicate crown. RESULTS: Anatomic contour zirconia (Lava Plus) crowns had the highest ILF (6065 N), followed by lithium disilicate (IPS e.max) (2788 N) and the composite resin materials (Protemp 4, Majesty Flow, Telio CAD, Estenia C&B, Lava Ultimate, VITA Enamic) (2386 to 1935 N). Veneered zirconia (Lava) crowns showed the lowest ILF (1477 N). The highest FS, CS, and E were found for Lava Plus and IPS e.max. No direct relationship was found between ILF and the FS, CS, or E. The finite element analysis showed stresses that did not exceed the FS or CS of IPS e.max. The surface roughness of these crowns might have caused initial failure at relatively low stresses. CONCLUSIONS: In this laboratory study, monolithic implant-supported crowns showed a higher ILF than conventional veneered ceramic crowns. Monolithic ceramic restorations might perform better than composite resin crowns.",2015,0,1,
14, A 3-year clinical evaluation of endodontically treated posterior teeth restored with two different materials using the CEREC AC chair-side system,"T. Lu, L. Peng, F. Xiong, X. Y. Lin, P. Zhang, Z. T. Lin and B. L. Wu", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The introduction of polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) materials may provide more options for dentists in restoring short clinical crowns and extensively damaged posterior teeth, but clinical data for their performance are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical study was to compare the 3-year performance and survival rates of PICN material with those of conservative ceramic onlay restorations for endodontically treated posterior teeth using the CEREC AC chair-side system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 101 onlay restorations of endodontically treated posterior teeth using the CEREC AC chair-side system were provided in 93 participants. The 101 teeth were divided into 2 groups: Vita Enamic group and Vitablocs Mark II group. Using the modified US Public Health Service quality evaluation system, 2 calibrated evaluators examined the performance of the onlay restorations over 3 years. The Kaplan-Meier method was adopted to analyze the survival rate of restorations (α=.05). The log rank test was used to compare the survival rates of the 2 groups. The Fisher exact test was performed to detect differences in the success rates for extensively damaged teeth and short clinical crown restorations between the 2 groups. The Silness and Löe gingival index was also recorded. RESULTS: The restoration survival rates in the 2 groups were 97.0% (Vita Enamic) and 90.7% (Vitablocs Mark II) (P>.05). Five failures were recorded (4.95%). These failures were caused by restoration debonding (60%), ceramic fractures (20%), and tooth fractures (20%). There were no significant differences between the success rates of restoring extensively damaged teeth and short clinical crowns between the 2 groups (P>.05). The periodontal condition of 25% of participants was improved 3 years after the onlay restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Onlay restorations of endodontically treated posterior teeth with Vita Enamic using the CEREC AC chair-side system are clinically promising prosthodontic alternatives, with a survival rate of 97.0% after 3 years. More research is needed to verify the results of this study.",2018,1,0,
209, Evaluation of the response of esthetic restorative materials to ultraviolet aging,"Y. S. Choi, K. H. Kang and W. Att", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The optical properties of esthetic computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials can change depending on the clinical situation. Studies that compare esthetic CAD-CAM materials based on their optical properties are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the optical properties of esthetic CAD-CAM specimens after ultraviolet (UV) aging based on the type and thickness of the material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 240 plate-shaped specimens (14×12×1 mm and 14×12×2 mm) of a nanohybrid composite resin (Tetric CAD), a fine-structure feldspathic ceramic (Vitablocs Mark II), 2 different glass-ceramics (IPS Empress CAD and IPS e.max CAD), a zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (Celtra Duo), a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (Vita Enamic), and 2 different resin nanoceramics (Cerasmart and Lava Ultimate) were fabricated (n=15). The optical parameters were analyzed by spectrophotometry before and after UV aging. The brightness (L∗), red green (a∗), yellow-blue (b∗), chroma (Ch), and hue (h) were measured, and the color difference (ΔE(00)) values were calculated. The translucency parameter (TP), total transmittance (Tt), and contrast ratio (CR) were also determined. Statistical analyses were performed with 1-way ANOVA, the Tukey honestly significant difference post hoc test, independent- and paired-samples t tests, and 2-way ANOVA (α=.05). RESULTS: Significant interactions were observed for the aging process, material type, and thickness for all optical parameters (P<.05). L∗, TP, and Tt had lower values, while CR had higher values for the aging group than that of the control group (P<.05). The h, TP, and Tt values were higher, whereas the b∗ and CR values were lower for the 1-mm group than those of the 2-mm group (P<.05). The highest ΔE(00) value was found in the Lava Ultimate 1-mm group (ΔE(00)=3.21) and 2-mm group (ΔE(00)=2.42). The lowest ΔE(00) value was found in the Vitablocs Mark II 1-mm group (ΔE(00)=0.31). The highest TP and Tt and the lowest CR values were observed for Tetric CAD; the lowest TP and Tt, and the highest CR values were noted in Celtra Duo (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The optical properties of the CAD-CAM specimens were affected by the aging process, material type, and thickness, and the color stability was clinically applicable in all CAD-CAM materials except groups Lava Ultimate and Cerasmart(ΔE(00)<2.25). Resin nanoceramics exhibited the greatest color changes after UV aging, and a 2-mm thickness is recommended to ensure acceptable color stability. The zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic was the most opaque, with a 1-mm thickness providing increased translucency.",2020,1,1,
38, Biomechanical behavior of endocrown restorations with different CAD-CAM materials: A 3D finite element and in vitro analysis,"Z. Zheng, Y. He, W. Ruan, Z. Ling, C. Zheng, Y. Gai and W. Yan", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The performance of endocrowns fabricated with different types of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this finite element analysis (FEA) and in vitro study was to compare and evaluate the stress distribution, failure probability, and fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored with endocrowns from CAD-CAM milling blocks including ceramic, polymer-infiltrated ceramic (PICN), and composite resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An endodontically treated first mandibular molar restored with an endocrown was modeled by using a CAD software program and imported into an FEA software program. The model was duplicated and received restorations made from CAD-CAM blocks: Vita Suprinity (VS), IPS e.max CAD (EMX), Vita Enamic (VE), Lava Ultimate (LU), and Grandio blocs (GR). Stress distributions under axial and oblique loading were analyzed. The Weibull function was combined with the FEA results to predict long-term failure probability. The mechanical failure behavior of endocrowns manufactured with these materials was tested by using a universal testing machine. Load-to-failure was recorded, and fractured specimens were subjected to fractography. The data were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA and the post hoc Tukey test (α=.05). RESULTS: The models of GR and LU exhibited a more even stress distribution. The Weibull analysis revealed that 5 models performed in a similar manner under normal occlusal forces, while LU and VE models achieved the highest probabilities during clenching. The fracture loads of GR (3808 ±607 N) were significantly higher than those of other materials (P<.05). More favorable failure modes were observed in the GR and VE groups. Fractography showed a greater probability of compression curls and arrest lines in the endocrowns of VE, LU, and GR groups. CONCLUSIONS: When restoring endodontically treated teeth, endocrown fabricated with composite resin exhibited a more uniform stress distribution and higher fracture resistance. More evidence from long-term clinical studies is needed to verify this effect.",2021,1,1,
423, Repair bond strength and nanoleakage of artificially aged CAD-CAM composite resin,"C. Arpa, L. Ceballos, M. V. Fuentes and J. Perdigão", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The polymerization of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) composite resins during their manufacture enhances their physical properties and biocompatibility but might compromise their reparability. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine the microtensile bond strength and nanoleakage (NL) of aged LAVA Ultimate (LU) CAD-CAM composite resin after different repair protocols. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-eight LU miniblocks were prepared, thermocycled (10000 cycles, 5°C to 55°C), and assigned to 10 surface pretreatment and bonding protocols: (1) tribochemical silica coating (CoJet, CoJet Sand; 3M ESPE)+Scotchbond Universal Adhesive (SBU; 3M ESPE); (2) CoJet+silane (SI, ESPE Sil; 3M ESPE)+Adper Scotchbond 1 XT Adhesive (XT; 3M ESPE); (3) CoJet+10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate-based silane (MO; Monobond Plus; Ivoclar Vivadent AG)+XT; (4) CoJet+XT; (5) 30-μm alumina airborne-particle abrasion (AL)+SBU; (6) AL+SI+XT; (7) AL+MO+XT; (8) AL+XT; (9) no pretreatment+SBU; and (10) no pretreatment+XT. All blocks were repaired using the Filtek Supreme XTE (3M ESPE) composite resin. Stick-shaped specimens (0.9×0.9 mm) were obtained and submitted to microtensile bond strength (μTBS) and %NL testing after 24 hours. μTBS data were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey post hoc test, and NL data with nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (α=.05). RESULTS: For μTBS, CoJet, and AL pretreatments showed significantly higher mean μTBS, especially when used together with SBU. No pretreatment+XT yielded the lowest mean μTBS. For NL, marginal sealing improved significantly after the use of SBU regardless of the surface treatment. This improvement was only statistically different after tribochemical silica coating. CONCLUSIONS: Airborne-particle abrasion with alumina particles, silica coated or not, together with the application of SBU resulted in the highest mean μTBS. The lowest %NL was recorded when aged LU blocks were repaired using SBU.",2019,0,1,
348, Marginal and internal fit of CAD-CAM-fabricated composite resin and ceramic crowns scanned by 2 intraoral cameras,"A. C. de Paula Silveira, S. B. Chaves, L. A. Hilgert and A. P. Ribeiro", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The precision of fit of chairside computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) complete crowns is affected by digital impression and restorative material. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate by microcomputed tomography (μCT) the marginal and internal adaptation of composite resin and ceramic complete crowns fabricated with 2 different intraoral cameras and 2 restorative materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten extracted human third molars received crown preparations. For each prepared molar, 2 digital impressions were made with different intraoral cameras of the CEREC system, Bluecam and Omnicam. Four groups were formed: LB (Lava Ultimate+Bluecam), EB (Emax+Bluecam), LO (Lava Ultimate+Omnicam), and EO (Emax+Omnicam). Before measuring the precision of fit, all crowns were stabilized with a silicone material. Each unit (crown + prepared tooth) was imaged with μCT, and marginal and internal discrepancies were analyzed. For the 2D analysis, 120 measurements were made of each crown for marginal adaptation, 20 for marginal discrepancy (MD), and 20 for absolute marginal discrepancy (AMD); and for internal adaptation, 40 for axial space (AS) and 40 for occlusal space (OS). After reconstructing the 3D images, the average internal space (AIS) was calculated by dividing the total volume of the internal space by the contact surface. Data were analyzed with 2-way ANOVA and quantile regression. RESULTS: Regarding marginal adaptation, no significant differences were observed among groups. For internal adaptation measured in the 2D evaluation, a significant difference was observed between LO and EO for the AS variable (Mann-Whitney test; P<.008). In assessment of AIS by the 3D reconstruction, LB presented significantly lower values than the other groups (Tukey post hoc test; P<.05). Bluecam presented lower values of AIS than Omnicam, and composite resin crowns showed less discrepancy than did ceramic crowns. CONCLUSIONS: The marginal adaptations assessed in all groups showed values within the clinically accepted range. Moreover, the composite resin blocks associated with the Bluecam intraoral camera demonstrated the best results for AIS compared with those of the other groups.",2017,0,1,
13, A 3-dimensional finite element and in vitro analysis of endocrown restorations fabricated with different preparation designs and various restorative materials,Ç. Ural and E. Çağlayan, J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The preparation design and fabrication materials directly affect the clinical success of endocrown restorations, and yet, knowledge is lacking about the biomechanical impact of specific designs or materials on endocrown restorations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro and finite element analysis study was to evaluate the biomechanical behavior of endocrown restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 36 freshly extracted mandibular first molars were collected. The teeth were prepared as per 2 different preparation geometries: with the buccal wall intact (Class 2) and without the buccal wall (Class 3). Teeth were restored with endocrowns made from 3 different fabricating materials, Vita Enamic, GC Cerasmart, and Lava Ultimate. To analyze the in vitro fracture strength, cemented endocrowns were loaded in a universal test machine with a 200-N oblique force until the restoration fractured. Finite element analysis was used to evaluate the stress distribution on both the dentin tissue and the restorative materials. The data were analyzed with a 2-way ANOVA test and the Tukey post hoc test (α=.05). RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the different preparation designs (Class 2 and Class 3) on fracture strength (P>.05). The highest mean ±standard deviation fracture strength values were found in the Lava Ultimate material (Class 2, 606.20 ±293; Class 3, 659.40 ±226 N) (P>.05), but the lowest fracture strength test values were obtained in the Vita Enamic material (Class 2, 439.60 ±136; Class 3, 340 ±98 N) (P>.05) for both preparation design test groups. CONCLUSIONS: A statistically significant difference was not found between the 2 tooth preparation classifications. However, significant differences were observed among the test groups in the Class 2 preparation specimens. The Class 2 preparation design exhibited a higher number of irreparable failures.",2021,0,0,
189, Effects of thermal and mechanical cycling on the mechanical strength and surface properties of dental CAD-CAM restorative materials,"S. H. Kim, Y. S. Choi, K. H. Kang and W. Att", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The properties of dental computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials vary. Studies regarding the effects of aging on the properties of these materials are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the changes in the mechanical and surface properties of different CAD-CAM materials after thermocycling and mechanical loading. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 150 bar-shaped specimens (17.0×4.0×2.0 mm) were prepared from feldspathic glass-ceramic (VM; Vitablocs Mark II), lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (EX; IPS e.max CAD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (CD; Celtra Duo), polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (VE; Vita Enamic), and resin-nanoceramic (CS; Cerasmart). Each type was divided into 2 groups (n=15; each). One group was subjected to thermocycling in distilled water at 5 °C to 55 °C for 6000 cycles and 50 N mechanical loading for 1.2×10(6) cycles. The other group was stored in 37 °C water for 24 hours. Nanoindentation hardness, Young modulus, and 3-point flexural strength were measured for the analyses of the mechanical properties. Surface roughness, surface microstructure, and elemental composition were measured to analyze the surface characteristics. Statistical analyses were performed with 1-way ANOVA with the Tukey HSD post hoc test, independent samples t test, Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni post hoc test, Mann-Whitney U test, and 2-way ANOVA (α=.05). RESULTS: Before and after aging, CS exhibited the lowest hardness (1.20 to 1.04 GPa) and Young modulus (13.76 to 13.48 GPa) values (P<.05). EX exhibited the highest flexural strengths (393.43 to 391.86 MPa), and VM exhibited the lowest (109.98 to 112.73 MPa) values (P<.05). CS exhibited the highest surface roughness (S(a) and S(q); 10.60 to 28.82, 14.21 to 38.27 nm) values (P<.05). After aging, the hardness and Young modulus of VM, EX, and VE decreased significantly (P<.001). No significant difference was observed in the flexural strengths of the CAD-CAM materials (P>.05). Significant increases were observed in the surface roughness of all the materials (P<.05), with altered microstructures. Except for the flexural strength, the mechanical properties and surface characteristics of the CAD-CAM materials were significantly affected by the material type after aging. CONCLUSIONS: Before and after aging, resin-nanoceramic exhibited the lowest hardness and Young modulus, and the highest surface roughness. Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic exhibited the highest flexural strength and feldspathic glass-ceramic exhibited the lowest value. After aging, increased surface roughness and microstructure alterations were observed. Significant interactions between aging process and material type were found for the mechanical properties and surface characteristics except for the flexural strength.",2021,1,0,
365, Mechanical properties of resin-ceramic CAD/CAM restorative materials,A. Awada and D. Nathanson, J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The recent development of polymer-based computer-aided design and computer-aided manufactured (CAD/CAM) milling blocks and the limited availability of independent studies on these materials make it pertinent to evaluate their properties and identify potential strengths and limitations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine and compare mechanical properties (flexural strength, flexural modulus, modulus of resilience) and compare the margin edge quality of recently introduced polymer-based CAD/CAM materials with some of their commercially available composite resin and ceramic counterparts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The materials studied were Lava Ultimate Restorative (LVU; 3M ESPE), Enamic (ENA; Vita Zahnfabrik), Cerasmart (CES; GC Dental Products), IPS Empress CAD (EMP; Ivoclar Vivadent AG), Vitablocs Mark II (VM2; Vita Zahnfabrik), and Paradigm MZ100 Block (MZ1; 3M ESPE). Polished 4×1×13.5 mm bars (n=25) were prepared from standard-sized milling blocks of each tested material. The bars were subjected to a 3-point flexural test on a 10-mm span with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. In addition, 42 conventional monolithic crowns (7 per material) were milled. Margin edge quality was observed by means of macrophotography and optical microscopy, providing a qualitative visual assessment and a measurement of existing roughness. The results were analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Tukey HSD test (α=.05). RESULTS: The mean flexural strength of the tested materials ranged from 105 ±9 MPa (VM2) to 219 ±20 MPa (CES). The mean flexural modulus ranged from 8 ±0.25 GPa (CES) to 32 ±1.9 GPa (EMP). The mean modulus of resilience ranged from 0.21 ±0.02 MPa (VM2) to 3.07 ±0.45 MPa (CES). The qualitative assessment of margin edge roughness revealed visible differences among the tested materials, with mean roughness measurements ranging from 60 ±16 μm (CES) to 190 ±15 μm (EMP). The material factor had a significant effect on the mean flexural strength (P<.001), flexural modulus (P<.001), modulus of resilience (P<.001), and margin edge roughness (P<.001) of the tested specimens. CONCLUSIONS: The new-generation polymer-based materials tested in this study exhibited significantly higher flexural strength and modulus of resilience, along with lower flexural modulus values compared with the tested ceramic or hybrid materials. Crowns milled from the new resin-based blocks seemed to exhibit visibly smoother margins compared with the ceramic materials studied.",2015,0,1,
300, Influence of different surface treatments and universal adhesives on the repair of CAD-CAM composite resins: An in vitro study,"S. Sismanoglu, Z. Yildirim-Bilmez, A. Erten-Taysi and P. Ercal", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The repairability of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) composite resins might be adversely affected by the high degree of matrix polymerization that occurs during their manufacturing process. However, information on their repairability is lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the microtensile bond strength of CAD-CAM composite resins subjected to simulated repair procedures by using varying surface treatments and universal adhesives. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four different CAD-CAM blocks (Brilliant Crios, Lava Ultimate, Shofu Block HC, and Vita Enamic) were thermocycled (5000 times, 5/55 °C) and divided into 4 groups according to the surface treatment: control, 9% hydrofluoric acid etching, aluminum oxide airborne-particle abrasion, and tribochemical silica airborne-particle abrasion. After surface treatments, the surface roughness was measured with a nanoindenter and further examined with scanning electron microscopy. After the application of 3 different universal adhesives (Clearfil Universal Bond, Prime&Bond Universal, and Single Bond Universal), the specimens were subjected to a simulated repair process with composite resin. Bonded specimens were cut into 1 mm(2) beams, and microtensile bond strength values were determined until failure at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The bond strength data were analyzed with 3-way analysis of variance, and surface roughness data were analyzed with 2-way analysis of variance tests. Pairwise analyses were performed with the Tukey test (α=.05). RESULTS: All surface treatments effectively improved repair microtensile bond strength values compared with the control (P<.05). Aluminum oxide airborne-particle abrasion had similar mean bond strength values compared with tribochemical silica airborne-particle abrasion (P>.05). Among the CAD-CAM blocks treated with hydrofluoric acid etching, Vita Enamic had the highest mean bond strength values. The highest mean microtensile bond strength repair values with the highest cohesive failure rates were found with the silane-containing universal adhesive (Single Bond Universal). CONCLUSIONS: Surface treatment with aluminum oxide airborne-particle abrasion and tribochemical silica airborne-particle abrasion produced successful repair results for aged resin nanoceramics, whereas hydrofluoric acid etching can be used for aged hybrid ceramic repair. Silane-containing universal adhesive reported increased bond strength. Application of universal adhesive after surface treatment is recommended to increase repair strength.",2020,0,1,
268, Impact of artificial aging by thermocycling on edge chipping resistance and Martens hardness of different dental CAD-CAM restorative materials,"R. Hampe, B. Theelke, N. Lümkemann and B. Stawarczyk", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The selection of an appropriate restorative material based on fracture behavior is important for the marginal integrity of a dental restoration. For computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorative materials, information regarding their edge chipping resistance is scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine the edge chipping resistance (ECR) and Martens hardness (HM) of 6 different dental CAD-CAM restorative materials before and after thermocycling. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four composite resin materials including Brilliant Crios; Cerasmart, an experimental material; Lava Ultimate, a polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) material (VITA Enamic), and a glass-ceramic control (IPS Empress CAD) were tested. The specimens were tested before and after thermocycling (30 000 times, 5 °C/55 °C). The ECR was measured for each material (n=25) and related to the point of loading and to the maximum chipping depth. HM was determined for each material (n=25). The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare materials (α=.05). The impact of thermocycling was analyzed by using the Wilcoxon test (α=.05). The correlations between all parameters were calculated by using the Spearman-Rho test (α=.05). For fractographic analysis of chip patterns, chipped surfaces were analyzed by laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: For ECR and HM, the materials showed different values. ECR(md) and ECR(pl) showed a positive correlation, but both showed a negative correlation to HM. The materials showed a different chip size (P<.001). Chip patterns revealed brittle material behavior in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: All tested CAD-CAM materials behaved as brittle materials, but HM and ECR differed among the materials. The control glass-ceramic material showed the highest values for HM, followed by the PICN material. ECR values revealed the opposite order of materials, with the highest for composite resins. Artificial aging by thermocycling affected all dental CAD-CAM restorative materials. Especially for composite resin materials, ECR changed after aging.",2021,1,1,
343, Macro- and microtopographical examination and quantification of CAD-CAM composite resin 2- and 3-body wear,"C. Stöckl, R. Hampe, B. Stawarczyk, M. Haerst and M. Roos", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The selection of an appropriate restorative material based on wear behavior is important for the long-term success of a dental restoration. For computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) composite resins, information about their wear resistance and wear mechanism is scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the 2- and 3-body wear of CAD-CAM composite resins with that of lithium disilicate ceramic and to develop analysis software. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Flat specimens were prepared from the following CAD-CAM composite resins: Cerasmart (CS), SHOFU Block HC (SH), Katana Avencia (KA), Brilliant Crios (BC), an experimental composite resin (EXP), and lithium disilicate ceramic IPS e.max CAD (REF). The specimens underwent 2-body wear (50 N, 5/55°C, 400 000 cycles) opposed by human enamel antagonists. Specimen wheels were prepared with each material on each wheel for 3-body wear with a millet slurry (15 N, 15% slip, 200 000 cycles). All specimens were digitized by using a dedicated laser scanner. Analysis software was developed to calculate macrotopographical examination of volume loss. The microtopography of the surfaces was examined by using scanning electron microscopy. For data analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test with the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test and the 1-sample Wilcoxon test were used (α=.05). RESULTS: After 2-body wear simulation, SH and KA presented higher volume loss than the other CAD-CAM materials. For 3-body wear, REF had lower volume loss than CS, SH, or BC. In addition, BC led to higher volume loss than EXP. The patterns of 2- and 3-body wear were different. CONCLUSIONS: The ceramic showed good global wear resistance. The volume loss of the CAD-CAM composite resins differed and depended on the material. The 2- and 3-body wear test methods tended to differ with regard to volume loss. Examination of the worn surfaces revealed different mechanisms acting in 2- and 3-body wear test.",2018,0,1,
283, In vitro fatigue resistance of CAD/CAM composite resin and ceramic posterior occlusal veneers,"P. Magne, L. H. Schlichting, H. P. Maia and L. N. Baratieri", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Thin, bonded, posterior occlusal veneers constitute a conservative alternative to traditional complete coverage crowns. Information regarding selection of the appropriate material and its influence on fatigue resistance, which may affect the longevity of the restoration, is missing. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the fatigue resistance of composite resin and ceramic posterior occlusal veneers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty extracted molars received a standardized nonretentive tooth preparation (simulating advanced occlusal erosion), including removal of occlusal enamel, exposure of dentin, and immediate dentin sealing (Optibond FL). All teeth were restored with a 1.2-mm-thick occlusal veneer (Cerec 3 chairside CAD/CAM system). The restorations (n=10) were milled from leucite-reinforced and lithium disilicate ceramics (IPS Empress CAD and IPS e.max CAD, respectively) and a composite resin (Paradigm MZ100). The intaglio surfaces of the ceramic restorations were conditioned by hydrofluoric acid etching and silane. Airborne-particle abrasion and silane were used to condition the composite resin restorations. Preparations were airborne-particle abraded and etched. All restorations were bonded with preheated luting material and submitted to cyclic isometric loading at 5 Hz, starting with a load of 200 N (x5000 cycles), followed by stepwise loading of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 N at a maximum of 30,000 cycles each. The number of cycles at initial failure (first cracks) was recorded. Specimens were loaded for a maximum of 185,000 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table survival analysis (alpha=.016, Bonferroni method). RESULTS: IPS Empress CAD failed at an average load of 900 N, with no specimen withstanding all 185,000 load cycles (survival 0%), while IPS e.max CAD and Paradigm MZ100 demonstrated survival rates of 30% and 100%, respectively. None of the specimens exhibited catastrophic failure, but only cracks limited to the restorative material. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior occlusal veneers made of composite resin (Paradigm MZ100) had significantly higher fatigue resistance (P<.002) compared to IPS Empress CAD and IPS e.max CAD.",2010,0,1,
395, Novel-design ultra-thin CAD/CAM composite resin and ceramic occlusal veneers for the treatment of severe dental erosion,"L. H. Schlichting, H. P. Maia, L. N. Baratieri and P. Magne", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Ultra-thin bonded posterior occlusal veneers represent a conservative alternative to traditional inlays and complete coverage crowns for the treatment of severe erosive lesions. There is a lack of data regarding selection of the most appropriate material and its influence on fatigue resistance, which may affect restoration longevity. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of CAD/CAM restorative material (ceramic vs. composite resin) on fatigue resistance of ultra-thin occlusal veneers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A standardized nonretentive tooth preparation (simulating advanced occlusal erosion) was applied to 40 extracted molars including removal of occlusal enamel, and immediate dentin sealing (Optibond FL). All teeth were restored with a 0.6 mm-thick occlusal veneer (Cerec3 chairside CAD/CAM system). Reinforced ceramics (Empress CAD and e.max CAD) and composite resins (Paradigm MZ100 and XR (experimental blocks)) were used to mill the restorations (n=10). The intaglio surfaces were HF-etched and silanated (reinforced ceramics) or airborne-particle abraded and silanated (composite resins). Preparations were airborne-particle abraded and etched before restoration insertion. All restorations were adhesively luted with preheated Filtek Z100. Cyclic isometric loading was applied at 5 Hz, beginning with a load of 200N (x5,000), followed by stages of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1,400N at a maximum of 30,000 cycles each. The number of cycles at initial failure (first cracks) was recorded. Specimens were loaded until catastrophic failure (lost restoration fragment) or to a maximum of 185,000 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table survival analysis (α=.008, Bonferroni-method). RESULTS: Empress CAD and e.max CAD initially failed at an average load of 500N and 800N, respectively with no specimen withstanding all 185,000 load cycles (survival 0%); with MZ100 and XR the survival rate was 60% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both composite resins (MZ100 and XR) increased the fatigue resistance of ultra-thin occlusal veneers (P<.001) when compared to the ceramics evaluated (Empress CAD and e.max CAD).",2011,0,1,
193, Energy dissipation capacities of CAD-CAM restorative materials: A comparative evaluation of resilience and toughness,"T. Niem, N. Youssef and B. Wöstmann", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Well-balanced physical properties of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials are important to ensure the clinical success and longevity of restorations. Therefore, the capacity of a material to dissipate destructive fracture energy by means of elastic and plastic material deformation is of interest. However, little information is available on how to quantify the resilience and toughness of CAD-CAM materials. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate and compare the resilience and toughness of CAD-CAM restorative materials and assess their capability to dissipate destructive fracture energy in comparison with a high-gold-content alloy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Restorative materials for 3-unit fixed partial dentures (Alphador No. 1, IPS e.max CAD, Lava Plus, PEEK Optima), crowns and onlays (CERASMART, CEREC Blocs, Lava Ultimate, VITA ENAMIC), and interim prostheses (M-PM Disc, Telio CAD) were investigated. The strain energy density was determined with a 3-point bend test to calculate the modulus of toughness, the modulus of resilience, and the elastic recovery and thus characterize the material properties of resilience and toughness. Data were statistically analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model by using the Huber-White sandwich estimator (α=.05). RESULTS: Significant differences were found among the materials concerning the modulus of toughness, the modulus of resilience, the elastic recovery, and the difference between the elastic recovery and the modulus of resilience (P<.001). Alphador produced the highest mean regarding the modulus of toughness followed by Telio CAD, Lava Plus, M-PM Disc, CERASMART, and Lava Ultimate; all showed significantly higher capacities to dissipate energy by elastic and plastic deformation when compared with the ceramic materials (IPS e.max CAD, VITA ENAMIC, CEREC Blocs). For the modulus of resilience and elastic recovery, Lava Plus and Alphador showed the highest mean values and therefore better able to only elastically absorb destructive fracture energy; the least able materials were VITA ENAMIC and CEREC Blocs. As PEEK Optima, M-PM Disc, and Lava Ultimate showed higher mean values for the modulus of resilience than IPS e.max CAD, they were better able to elastically dissipate energy. CONCLUSIONS: Alphador had the highest values for the modulus of toughness, the elastic recovery, and the difference between the elastic recovery and the modulus of resilience; this was equivalent to pronounced energy dissipation capacities. In comparison, Lava Plus showed the highest modulus of resilience but significantly lower results for all other parameters and therefore fewer energy-consuming capabilities. The new polymer-based CAD-CAM restorative materials in general had a higher modulus of toughness and elastic recovery than ceramics and thereby partially resemble Lava Plus, all with similar capacities to dissipate destructive energy.",2019,1,0,
323, Influence of thermomechanical fatigue on the fracture strength of CAD-CAM-fabricated occlusal veneers,"M. Al-Akhali, M. Kern, A. Elsayed, A. Samran and M. S. Chaar", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: With the development of new computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorative dental materials, limited data regarding their survival rate and fracture strength are available when they are used as occlusal veneers. Therefore, these materials should be evaluated under conditions similar to those of the oral environment before being recommended for clinical use. PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of thermomechanical fatigue loading on the fracture strength of minimally invasive occlusal veneer restorations fabricated from different CAD-CAM materials and bonded to human maxillary premolars using self-etchnig bonding technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-four CAD-CAM occlusal veneer restorations were fabricated from group LD (lithium disilicate [e.max CAD]), LS (zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate [Vita Suprinity]), PI (polymer-infiltrated ceramic [Vita Enamic]), and PM (polymethylmethacrylate [Telio CAD]). The occlusal veneers were luted to enamel (n=16) using a self-etching primer (Multilink Primer A/B) and a luting composite resin (Multilink Automix). Half of the specimens of each group (n=8) were randomly selected and subjected to thermomechanical fatigue loading in a masticatory simulator (1.2 million cycles at 98 N with 5(°)C-55(°)C thermocycling). All specimens were quasistatically loaded until fracture. The statistical analysis was made using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (α=.05). RESULTS: According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis after the thermomechanical fatigue of the 4 groups, the cumulative survival rate was as follows: group LD, 50% group LS, 62.5% group PI, 37.5%; and group PM, 50%. Although some of the surviving specimens exhibited microcracking, their integrity or bonding to teeth was not affected. Thermomechanical fatigue significantly reduced the fracture strength of group PI (P=.047) and group PM (P=.025). Without thermomechanical fatigue, group PM showed significantly higher fracture strength than group LS (P=.015). CONCLUSIONS: In general, thermomechanical fatigue decreased the survival rate and fracture strength in all test groups.",2019,1,0,
123, Effect of CAD-CAM ceramic materials on the color match of veneer restorations,"Y. Su, M. Xin, X. Chen and W. Xing", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: With the different translucency levels and types of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) ceramic materials, choosing the most appropriate CAD-CAM ceramic materials to better reproduce the color appearance of natural teeth can be challenging. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to analyze the color differences between natural teeth and milled veneers fabricated with the different types of CAD-CAM ceramic materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten extracted maxillary central incisor teeth with the A2 shade in the body region were prepared for ceramic veneers. The veneer restorations were designed by using the duplicating method and fabricated from 9 milling blocks (IPS e.max CAD HT/LT, Lava Ultimate CAD HT/LT, VITA SUPRINITY HT/T, IPS Empress CAD HT/LT/Multi) in a dental milling unit (n=10). The bonding surface of the abutment tooth was coated with a thin layer of a separating agent, and the veneer specimen with resin cement was then bonded to the corresponding abutment tooth. A clinical spectrophotometer was used to measure the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage Lab values of natural teeth, abutment teeth, and milled veneers in the cervical, body, and incisal regions. Color differences between the natural tooth and A2 shade tab (ΔE(1)) and between the milled veneer and natural tooth (ΔE(2)) were calculated. The ΔE(2) values were compared with the perceptibility threshold (ΔE=2.6) and acceptability threshold (ΔE=5.5). The paired-samples t test, 1-way analysis of covariance, and 2-way ANOVA were used to analyze data (α=.05). RESULTS: The results of 1-way analysis of covariance showed that ceramic materials significantly affected the a∗ and b∗ values of the milled veneers (P<.001) but did not affect the L∗ values of the milled veneers (P>.05). The results of 2-way ANOVA indicated that the ΔE(2) values were not significantly affected by different CAD-CAM ceramic materials (F=1.560, P=.138), while statistically significant differences were found in the veneer regions (F=6.588, P=.002). The ΔE(2) values ranged from 2.41 to 5.36, less than the clinically acceptable color threshold of 5.5. CONCLUSIONS: The color parameters of milled veneers were affected by the different types of CAD-CAM ceramic materials. The color of the veneer restoration was able to match that of the natural tooth.",2021,1,0,
370, Microhardness of light- and dual-polymerizable luting resins polymerized through 7.5-mm-thick endocrowns,"L. Gregor, S. Bouillaguet, I. Onisor, S. Ardu, I. Krejci and G. T. Rocca", J Prosthet Dent," STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: The complete polymerization of luting resins through thick indirect restorations is still questioned. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree of polymerization of light- and dual-polymerizable luting resins under thick indirect composite resin and ceramic endocrowns by means of Vickers microhardness measurements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Vickers microhardness measurements of a light-polymerizable microhybrid composite resin and a dual-polymerizable luting cement directly polymerized in a natural tooth mold for 40 seconds with a high-power light-emitting diode lamp (control) were compared with measurements after indirect irradiation through 7.5-mm-thick composite resin and ceramic endocrowns for 3 × 90 seconds. A test-to-control microhardness values ratio of 0.80 at a depth of 0.5 mm below the surface was assumed as the criterion for adequate conversion. RESULTS: For the Vickers microhardness measurements of a dual-polymerizable luting cement, no differences (P>.05) were found between Vickers microhardness control values and values reported after polymerization through composite resin and ceramic endocrowns. For The Vickers microhardness measurements (±SD) of a light-polymerizable microhybrid composite resin, control values were significantly (P<.05) higher (111 ±3.3) than those reported after polymerization through composite resin (100.5 ±3.8) and ceramic (99.7 ±2.3) endocrowns. However, the hardness values of The Vickers microhardness measurements of a light-polymerizable microhybrid composite resin polymerized through the endocrowns were approximately 10% to 12% lower than those of the control values. Two-way ANOVA showed the influence of the luting material on the Vickers microhardness values (P<.05). The effect of endocrown material was not significant (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this in vitro study, Vickers microhardness values of the dual-polymerizable resin cement and the light-polymerizable restorative composite resin irradiated for 3 × 90 seconds with a high irradiance light-emitting diode lamp through 7.5-mm-thick endocrowns reached at least 80% of the control Vickers microhardness values, which means that both materials can be adequately polymerized when they are used for luting thick indirect restorations.",2014,0,1,
387, Minimal preparation designs for single posterior indirect prostheses with the use of the Cerec system,E. A. Tsitrou and R. van Noort, Int J Comput Dent," The advantages of minimally invasive dentistry are well established, especially for direct restorations. However, when it comes to indirect restorations traditional tooth preparation designs are still advised by most manufacturers. The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the ability of a CAD/CAM machine (Cerec) to produce minimal preparation designs and identify limiting parameters. Crown preparations based on the proposed minimal design were made using phantom teeth. Gauged burs (Intensiv SA; Meissinger, Germany) and a paralleling device were used to standardize preparations. Cerec Scan/Cerec 3D was used for scanning and designing. The materials tested were a resin composite (Paradigm MZ100, 3M ESPE) and two ceramic materials (ProCAD, Ivoclar Vivadent, and VITA Mark II, Vita). The morphology, marginal integrity, and materials' integrity were examined. The design was subjected to an interactive process as material property limitations and constraints imposed by the system became apparent. SEM, optical microscopy, and transillumination were used for the qualitative control of the crowns. The results of this study showed that only the composite material produced acceptable crowns with intact margins for the minimal design initially proposed. The ceramic materials required a wider preparation design in order to produce acceptable crowns. Within the limitations of this study, the null hypothesis was partially rejected as it was found that only the composite material could produce acceptable crowns based on the proposed minimal design. It was also found that the materials' properties, the milling mode, and cutting instruments are determining factors in establishing the extent of the minimal preparation.",2008,0,1,
297, Influence of different composite materials and cavity preparation designs on the fracture resistance of mesio-occluso-distal inlay restoration,"N. Tekçe, K. Pala, M. Demirci and S. Tuncer", Dent Mater J," The aim of the study to evaluate the fracture resistance of a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and three indirect composite materials for three different mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) inlay cavity designs. A total of 120 mandibular third molar were divided into three groups: (G1) non-proximal box, (G2) 2-mm proximal box, and (G3) 4-mm proximal box. Each cavity design received four composite materials: Estenia, Epricord (Kuraray, Japan), Tescera (Bisco, USA), and Cerasmart CAD/CAM blocks (GC, USA). The specimens were subjected to a compressive load at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The data was analyzed using the two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc test (p<0.05). Estenia exhibited significantly higher fracture strength than Epricord and Cerasmart in G1. In G2 and G3, there was no significant difference among the four materials. Using a non-proximal box design for the cavity can improve the fracture resistance of the inlay restoration.",2016,0,1,
114, Effect of accelerated staining and bleaching on chairside CAD/CAM materials with high and low translucency,"C. Gasparik, B. Culic, M. A. Varvara, A. Grecu, A. Burde and D. Dudea", Dent Mater J," The aim of the study was to assess the effect of staining and bleaching on CAD/CAM materials with high (HT) and low translucency (LT or T). Samples were stored in coffee and subsequently bleached. CIELAB parameters were recorded at baseline, after coffee immersion, after bleaching. Translucency parameter (TP), whiteness index (WID) and color changes were calculated (ΔE(00)). Influence of staining and bleaching was analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and color differences between materials were analyzed with one-way ANOVA (α=0.05). Staining and bleaching significantly affected CIELAB parameters and WID for all materials (p<0.001). TP was significantly influenced by staining and bleaching for Crios and Enamic (p<0.05). Mean color differences were significantly different between materials (p<0.001). The greatest color changes due to staining were observed for Lava Ultimate while the lowest for e.max CAD. Both coffee staining and bleaching induced greater color changes for HT materials of the same brand compared to LT.",2019,0,0,
151, Effect of Preparation Depth on the Marginal and Internal Adaptation of Computer-aided Design/Computer-assisted Manufacture Endocrowns,M. D. Gaintantzopoulou and H. M. El-Damanhoury, Oper Dent," The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of preparation depth and intraradicular extension on the marginal and internal adaptation of computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) endocrown restorations. Standardized preparations were made in resin endodontic tooth models (Nissin Dental), with an intracoronal preparation depth of 2 mm (group H2), with extra 1- (group H3) or 2-mm (group H4) intraradicular extensions in the root canals (n=12). Vita Enamic polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network material endocrowns were fabricated using the CEREC AC CAD/CAM system and were seated on the prepared teeth. Specimens were evaluated by microtomography. Horizontal and vertical tomographic sections were recorded and reconstructed by using the CTSkan software (TView v1.1, Skyscan).The surface/void volume (S/V) in the region of interest was calculated. Marginal gap (MG), absolute marginal discrepancy (MD), and internal marginal gap were measured at various measuring locations and calculated in microscale (μm). Marginal and internal discrepancy data (μm) were analyzed with nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance by ranks with Dunn's post hoc, whereas S/V data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni multiple comparisons (α=0.05). Significant differences were found in MG, MD, and internal gap width values between the groups, with H2 showing the lowest values from all groups. S/V calculations presented significant differences between H2 and the other two groups (H3 and H4) tested, with H2 again showing the lowest values. Increasing the intraradicular extension of endocrown restorations increased the marginal and internal gap of endocrown restorations.",2016,1,0,
285, In Vitro Investigation of Wear of CAD/CAM Polymeric Materials Against Primary Teeth,"J. W. Choi, E. J. Song, J. H. Shin, T. S. Jeong and J. B. Huh", Materials (Basel)," The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of polymeric computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing CAD/CAM materials on antagonistic primary tooth wear. Five CAD/CAM polymeric materials were examined: Vipi Block Monocolor (VBM), Yamahachi polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (YAP), Mazic Duro (MZD), Vita Enamic (ENA), and Pekkton (PEK). All of the specimens were tested in a thermomechanical loading machine with the primary canine as the antagonist (50 N, 1.2 × 10⁵ cycles, 1.7 Hz, 5/55 °C). The wear losses of the antagonist tooth and the restorative materials were calculated using reverse modelling software and an electronic scale. VBM and ENA showed significantly higher antagonist tooth wear than PEK (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference observed among VBM, YAP, MZD, and ENA (p > 0.05). PEK showed the largest value in both material volumetric and weight losses. In terms of material volumetric losses, there was no significant difference between all of the groups (p > 0.05). In terms of material weight losses, PEK was significantly larger than ENA (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between VBM, YAP, MZD, and ENA (p > 0.05). Volumetric and weight losses of materials showed similar wear behaviour. However, the wear patterns of antagonists and materials were different, especially in PEK.",2017,0,0,
59, Cerec anterior crowns: restorative options with monolithic ceramic materials,S. Reich and K. Fiedlar, Int J Comput Dent," The aim of this article is to discuss the different types of monolithic ceramic crowns that can be placed on anterior teeth with existing shoulder preparations. Anterior crowns were indicated for the teeth 12 to 22 in the present case. The patient, a 65-year-old male, had received all-ceramic crowns 20 years earlier, which had started to develop cracks and palatal fractures over the last few years. The patient's teeth were prepared and four sets of crowns were fabricated using different monolithic ceramic materials: IPS e.max CAD, Cerec Blocs C In, VITABLOCS Real Life, and ENAMIC. Both shade characterization and crystallization firing were performed on the monolithic lithium disilicate glass ceramic crowns. The silicate ceramic crowns received glaze firing alone.

310, Influence of Post-Core and Crown Type on the Fracture Resistance of Incisors Submitted to Quasistatic Loading,"S. Uctasli, Y. Boz, S. Sungur, P. K. Vallittu, S. Garoushi and L. Lassila", Polymers (Basel)," The aim of this paper was to evaluate the fracture resistance and failure type of maxillary incisor teeth, rebuilt with various types of post-core restorations and full crowns made of either direct conventional particulate filler composite (PFC, G-aenial Anterior, GC, Tokyo, Japan) or indirect CAD/CAM restorations (composite Cerasmart 270 and glass ceramic LiSi Block from GC). One hundred (n = 10/group) central incisors were cut and divided into 10 experimental groups restored with different approaches. In approach A, teeth were restored with a core build-up composite (Gradia Core, GC) for a core and full crown of PFC. Approach B had teeth restored using composite core and prefabricated fiber posts, and a complete crown of either PFC or CAD/CAM. Approach C contained teeth restored with a core of short fiber-reinforced composite (everX Flow, GC) and prefabricated fiber posts, and a complete crown of either PFC or CAD/CAM. In approach D, the teeth had a core of short fiber-reinforced composite only, and a complete crown of either PFC or CAD/CAM restorations. The root canals were prepared, and when posts were used, they were luted with either a dual-cure resin cement (LinkForce, GC) or everX Flow. As the control, sound teeth (n = 10) were used. Restorations were quasi-statically loaded until fracture. Failure type was visually investigated. The interface between the fiber post and luting cement was investigated using SEM, before and after completion of the loading test. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance (p = 0.05) followed by Tukey's test. None of the restorative approaches restored the fracture load strength of intact teeth (p < 0.05). Restorations with additional fiber posts (Approaches B and C) had higher load-bearing capacity (p < 0.05) than restorations without fiber posts (Approaches A and D). Restorations that had short fiber-reinforced composite cores with or without fiber posts presented more repairable failures. Using short fiber-reinforced composite as post-luting and core build-up material with conventional fiber posts proved to be a promising method to strengthen severely damaged incisors.",2021,0,1,
456, Shear-bond strength and optical properties of short fiber-reinforced CAD/CAM composite blocks,"E. Mangoush, L. Lassila, P. K. Vallittu and S. Garoushi", Eur J Oral Sci," The aim of this study was to assess the shear-bond strength (SBS) of resin-luting cement to experimental short fiber-reinforced CAD/CAM composite (SFRC) compared to conventional CAD/CAM (Cerasmart 270), 3D printed (GC TEMP PRINT, Pro3dure GR-17), and laboratory (Gradia Plus) composites. Moreover, translucency parameter values and light transmission were evaluated. For each of the five types of composites, discs were prepared (n = 16/group) and divided into subgroups (n = 8/group) according to surface treatment protocol (hydrofluoric acid or air-particle abrasion). SBS test was performed using universal testing machine until failure, and failure modes were visually analyzed. Translucency parameter and curing-light transmission values through 1, 2, and 3 mm thickness were quantified using spectrophotometry and the MARC resin calibrator, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the CAD/CAM composites after surface treatment. Composite type and surface treatment had a significant effect on SBS. Laboratory composite showed the highest SBS value (22.4 MPa). Cerasmart 270 exhibited higher translucency parameter values (19.8, 11.0, 5.0) than SFRC (14.5, 5.2, 1.6) at the three composite thicknesses tested. Air-particle abrasion was more effective in enhancing SBS than acid etching. Experimental SFRC CAD/CAM composite showed higher SBS values than Cerasmart 270. For all composites, translucency parameter values and light transmission decreased as thickness increased.",2021,0,1,

Edelhoff", Dent Mater J," The aim of this study was to compare the light translucency and fluorescence 5 manually and 11 CAD/CAM polymer materials to a glass-ceramic material. Light-transmission was measured using a spectrophotometer. Overall light transmission (n=40) was calculated as the integration (tc (λ) dλ [10(-5)]) of all tc values for the wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm.

Miyazaki", Dent Mater J," The aim of this study was to determine the influence of different surface treatments of CAD/CAM composite blocks on bonding effectiveness of resin cements, based on the shear bond strength test and the surface science examination. Specimens were fabricated from two types of CAD/CAM composite blocks (Cerasmart and VITA Enamic), and the specimen surfaces were alumina sandblasted. Specimen surfaces were treated with i) silane, ii) primer, and iii) silane+primer, then two types of cements (Block HC Cem and Super Bond) were bonded. After 24 h storage, bond strengths were measured. Surface free energy measurements were performed of the treated CAD/CAM composite blocks surfaces. The groups ii) and iii) showed significantly higher bond strengths than the group i), apart from VITA Enamic with Block HC Cem. Although the total surface free energy showed different trends in different surface treatments, a similar trend was found in both CAD/CAM composite blocks.",2020,0,1,
112, Effect of 2 Bleaching Agents with a Content of High Concentrated Hydrogen Peroxide on Stained 2 CAD/CAM Blocks and a Nanohybrid Composite Resin: An AFM Evaluation,İ. Karakaya and E. Cengiz, Biomed Res Int," The aim of this study was to evaluate color stability of 3 restorative materials, discoloration ability of different solutions, efficacy of 2 office bleaching agents, and surface roughness and topography. Sixty specimens for Clearfil Majesty Esthetic (CME), Lava Ultimate (LU), and Vita Enamic (VE) were prepared. They were immersed into 3 staining solutions for 2 weeks and then they were bleached. According to the measured L(⁎), a(⁎), and b(⁎) parameters described by CIELAB system, color changes (ΔE(00)), translucency parameters (TP), whiteness index values (W(⁎)), and changes in closeness to pure white (ΔW(⁎)) were calculated. Then 3 specimens from each group were scanned with an atomic force microscope for surface analysis. After staining, CME groups and control groups of LU and VE showed clinically acceptable color changes (ΔE(00) < 1,8). After bleaching, while a reverse effect on color was observed, VE showed the furthest color values to pure white. There was no statistically significant difference between whiteness index values of LU and CME. LU was the most translucent material during the study and TP values of materials showed minimal differences. Most of the VE groups and a control group of LU showed surface roughness (R(a) ) values higher than critical value for biofilm accumulation (0,2 μm).",2017,0,0,
104," Different Methods for Inlay Production: Effect on Internal and Marginal Adaptation, Adjustment Time, and Contact Point","M. P. Rippe, C. Monaco, L. Volpe, M. A. Bottino, R. Scotti and L. F. Valandro", Oper Dent," The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different production methods of resin and ceramic inlays on marginal and internal adaptation, adjustment time, and proximal contacts. Forty premolars were selected, embedded (their roots), and prepared to receive inlays that were made as follows (n=10): LaRe-digital impression with a Lava C.O.S. scanner, followed by milling of Lava Ultimate block (composite resin) in a milling center; CeRe-digital impression with a Cerec 3D Bluecam scanner, followed by milling of Lava Ultimate block in Cerec; CeDis-digital impression with a Cerec 3D Bluecam scanner, followed by milling of IPS e.max CAD block (lithium disilicate) in Cerec; and PresDis-impression with polyvinyl siloxane, inlay made using the lost wax technique and IPS e.max Press pressed ceramic (lithium disilicate). Marginal and internal adaptations were measured using the replica technique. The inlay adjustments were performed using diamond burs in a contra-angle hand piece, and the time for adjustment was recorded using a timer, in seconds. The tightness of the proximal contact was measured using standardized metal blades. The statistical analyses for marginal fit data showed that at the cervical edge, CeDis (177.8 μm) had greater misfit than CeRe (116.7 μm), while all the groups had similar adaptation at the occlusal edge. The groups had similar internal fit at the pulpal wall, while LaRe (104.7 μm) > CeDis (66.7 μm) = CeRe (76.7 μm) at the axial wall. The groups restored with lithium disilicate ceramic took more time for adjustment when compared to the resin restorative material. The lowest proximal contact, in micrometers, was seen in the CeRe group (8.8 μm).",2017,0,1,
56, Can different etching protocols change the properties of a hybrid ceramic?,"J. S. Miranda, J. B. Monteiro, P. N. F. Silva, M. C. Valera, E. Bresciani and R. M. Melo", Gen Dent," The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and etching times on the flexural strength, roughness, wettability, and type of failure of a hybrid ceramic (VITA ENAMIC). Blocks of the ceramic material were made according to the norms of International Organization for Standardization standard 6872:2015 and randomly divided into 7 groups (n = 13): control (no treatment); surface etching with 5% HF for 30 (HF5-30), 60 (HF5-60), or 90 (HF5-90) seconds; and surface etching with 10% HF for 30 (HF10-30), 60 (HF10-60), or 90 (HF10-90) seconds. The adhesive surface of 10 specimens in each group was cemented with dual-curing resin cement. The specimens were submitted to biaxial flexural tests and fractographic analysis. Surface analyses were carried out using 3 noncemented specimens from each group. The surface roughness was evaluated through optical profilometry and the surface wettability through goniometry (contact angle). The values obtained were analyzed by a Dunnett test followed by 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey test (α = 5%). The flexural test results indicated a statistically significant reduction in the resistance of the ceramic when conditioned with 10% acid (P < 0.01). Etching with HF, at any concentration used for any applied time, significantly modified the ceramic roughness of the experimental groups (P < 0.01). The wettability was also significantly altered in the HF5-90 group and in all HF10 groups (P < 0.01). The higher the concentration of the acid, the lower the wettability of the ceramic (P < 0.01). Based on these results, a 5% HF concentration is best indicated for the surface treatment of VITA ENAMIC.",2020,1,0,
138, Effect of Endocrown Restorations with Different CAD/CAM Materials: 3D Finite Element and Weibull Analyses,L. Gulec and N. Ulusoy, Biomed Res Int," The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two endocrown designs and computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials on stress distribution and failure probability of restorations applied to severely damaged endodontically treated maxillary first premolar tooth (MFP). Two types of designs without and with 3 mm intraradicular extensions, endocrown (E) and modified endocrown (ME), were modeled on a 3D Finite element (FE) model of the MFP. Vitablocks Mark II (VMII), Vita Enamic (VE), and Lava Ultimate (LU) CAD/CAM materials were used for each type of design. von Mises and maximum principle values were evaluated and the Weibull function was incorporated with FE analysis to calculate the long term failure probability. Regarding the stresses that occurred in enamel, for each group of material, ME restoration design transmitted less stress than endocrown. During normal occlusal function, the overall failure probability was minimum for ME with VMII. ME restoration design with VE was the best restorative option for premolar teeth with extensive loss of coronal structure under high occlusal loads. Therefore, ME design could be a favorable treatment option for MFPs with missing palatal cusp. Among the CAD/CAM materials tested, VMII and VE were found to be more tooth-friendly than LU.",2017,0,0,

Tagami", Dent Mater J," The aim of this study was to evaluate the time elapsed bond strength of the CAD/CAM resin block (CRB) to bovine dentin after alumina blasting. CRB (KATANA AVENCIA BLOCK) slices were ground with #600-SiC paper and divided into three groups according to alumina blasting pressure -0.1 MPa, 0.2 MPa or untreated- and then divided into two subgroups according to the time elapsed after alumina blasting -same-day or one-week ""dry-storage"" at controlled laboratory conditions before cementation. The CRB slices were then cemented to bovine dentin with Panavia V5 (Kuraray Noritake Dental), and divided into two subgroups -light curing or chemical curing. After 24 h storage in distilled water at 37°C, the specimens were then subjected to micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) testing. One-week group showed a significant decrease in µTBS. The µTBS values showed that CRBs must be cemented with light curing immediately after alumina blasting at 0.1 or 0.2 MPa to obtain a stable adhesion.",2019,0,0,
178, Effect of various surface treatments on the bond strength of resin luting agent and the surface roughness and surface energy of CAD/CAM materials,"P. Chuenjit, M. Suzuki and K. Shinkai", Dent Mater J," The aim of this study was to examine the effect of various surface treatments on the bond strength of a resin luting agent and the surface roughness and surface energy of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials. Four types of CAD/CAM blocks (Shofu Block HC: BHC; GC Cerasmart: CER; VITA Enamic: ENA; and Lava Ultimate: LAV) were used. All blocks were randomly divided into eight groups based on the surface treatment as follows: no surface treatment (C), airborne-particle abrasion (AA), hydrofluoric acid etching (HA), silane coupling agent application (SL), AA/SL, HA/SL, AA/HA, and AA/HA/SL. The microtensile bond strength (µTBS), surface roughness and surface energy were measured. Three-way ANOVA revealed that all surface treatments significantly influenced the µTBS between the resin luting agent and all types of CAD/CAM materials; however, the effect of each surface treatment on surface roughness and energy was dependent on the CAD/CAM materials.",2021,0,0,
155, Effect of sandblasting and/or priming treatment on the shear bond strength of self-adhesive resin cement to CAD/CAM blocks,"Y. Nagasawa, Y. Eda, H. Shigeta, M. Ferrari, H. Nakajima and Y. Hibino", Odontology," The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two different priming agents and/or sandblasting on the shear bond strength of self-adhesive resin cement to the resin composite for core build-up to CAD/CAM blocks. A CAD/CAM ceramic block (GN I CERAMIC BLOCK, GC) and a CAD/CAM resin composite block (CERASMART 270, GC), a self-adhesive resin cement (G-CEM ONE, GC) and two different primers, i.e., a multipurpose primer (MP; G-Multi Primer, GC) and a ceramic primer (CP; Ceramic Primer II, GC), were examined. Five different surface treatments with priming and/or sandblasting and no surface treatment (control) were performed on the block. Disk specimens (6 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness) made from core composites were cemented to the blocks after the surface treatments. Then, the 24-h shear bond strength of the resin cement between the block and the resin composite core was determined (n = 15). Sandblasted specimens had greater bond strength than controls for both blocks (p < 0.05). Priming to both blocks significantly increased the bond strength of resin cement compared to that of controls (p < 0.05). Although Weibull moduli were not significantly changed among all surface treatments for both blocks, the strengths with 5% and 95% failure probability of sandblasted and/or primed blocks were estimated to be greater than those of controls. The combination of priming and sandblasting to the CAD/CAM composite and ceramic surface was effective in increasing the bond strength of the resin cement.",2021,0,1,
97, Correlation between microstructure of CAD/CAM composites and the silanization effect on adhesive bonding,"H. T. Yano, H. Ikeda, Y. Nagamatsu, C. Masaki, R. Hosokawa and H. Shimizu", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the microstructure of a CAD/CAM composite and the silanization effect on adhesive bonding, using surface free energy (SFE) analysis. Six commercial CAD/CAM composites, as well as control samples of two glass-ceramics and a resin, were investigated. The samples were characterized by morphological observations and SFE analysis. The bonding characteristics of the samples with the resin-cement were evaluated according to the silanization effect, which was determined from the ratio between the shear-bond strengths for the sample groups, with and without a silane-primer application. The composites were classified into two groups in terms of their microstructure; ENAMIC exhibits a polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network (PICN) structure, while the other composites have a dispersed-filler (DF) structure. The dispersive component of the SFE was significantly lower in the PICN composite than in the DF composites. On the other hand, the polar component of the SFE was significantly higher in the PICN composite than in the DF composites. These SFE components were similar to those of glass-ceramics for the PICN composite and to those of the resin for the DF composites. The silanization effect increased linearly with the polar component or with a decrease in the dispersive component. Additionally, the silanization effect increased with the inorganic content. As a result, the silanization effect was found to be the highest for the PICN structure of ENAMIC. The results revealed that the silanization effect on the adhesive bonding is more effective for a PICN composite than for a DF composite.",2020,1,1,
245, Fracture resistance of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing-generated composite resin-based molar crowns,"A. Harada, K. Nakamura, T. Kanno, R. Inagaki, U. Örtengren, Y. Niwano, K. Sasaki and H. Egusa", Eur J Oral Sci," The aim of this study was to investigate whether different fabrication processes, such as the computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system or the manual build-up technique, affect the fracture resistance of composite resin-based crowns. Lava Ultimate (LU), Estenia C&B (EC&B), and lithium disilicate glass-ceramic IPS e.max press (EMP) were used. Four types of molar crowns were fabricated: CAD/CAM-generated composite resin-based crowns (LU crowns); manually built-up monolayer composite resin-based crowns (EC&B-monolayer crowns); manually built-up layered composite resin-based crowns (EC&B-layered crowns); and EMP crowns. Each type of crown was cemented to dies and the fracture resistance was tested. EC&B-layered crowns showed significantly lower fracture resistance compared with LU and EMP crowns, although there was no significant difference in flexural strength or fracture toughness between LU and EC&B materials. Micro-computed tomography and fractographic analysis showed that decreased strength probably resulted from internal voids in the EC&B-layered crowns introduced by the layering process. There was no significant difference in fracture resistance among LU, EC&B-monolayer, and EMP crowns. Both types of composite resin-based crowns showed fracture loads of >2000 N, which is higher than the molar bite force. Therefore, CAD/CAM-generated crowns, without internal defects, may be applied to molar regions with sufficient fracture resistance.",2015,0,1,
262, High-temperature-pressure polymerized resin-infiltrated ceramic networks,"J. F. Nguyen, D. Ruse, A. C. Phan and M. J. Sadoun", J Dent Res," The aim of this study was to produce composite blocks (CB) for CAD/CAM applications by high-temperature-pressure (HT/HP) polymerization of resin-infiltrated glass-ceramic networks. The effect of network sintering and the absence/presence of initiator was investigated. Mechanical properties were determined and compared with those of Paradigm MZ100 (3M ESPE) blocks and HT/HP polymerized experimental ""classic"" CB, in which the filler had been incorporated by conventional mixing. The networks were made from glass-ceramic powder (VITA Zahnfabrik) formed by slip casting and were either sintered or not. They were silanized, infiltrated by urethane dimethacrylate, with or without initiator, and polymerized under HT/HP (300 MPa, 180°C) to obtain resin-infiltrated glass-ceramic network (RIGCN) CB. HT/HP polymerized CB were also made from an experimental ""classic"" composite. Flexural strength (σf), fracture toughness (KIC), and Vickers hardness were determined and analyzed by one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Scheffé multiple-means comparisons (α = 0.05), and Weibull statistics (for σf). Fractured surfaces were characterized with scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical properties of RIGCN CB were significantly higher. Sintering induced significant increases in σf and hardness, while the initiator significantly decreased hardness. The results suggested that RIGCN and HT/HP polymerization could be used to obtain CB with superior mechanical properties, suitable for CAD/CAM applications.",2014,1,1,
433, Resin Bonding to a Hybrid Ceramic: Effects of Surface Treatments and Aging,"F. Campos, C. S. Almeida, M. P. Rippe, R. M. de Melo, L. F. Valandro and M. A. Bottino", Oper Dent," The aim of this study was to verify the effects of different surface treatments on the microtensile bond strength between resin cement and a hybrid ceramic. Thirty-two hybrid ceramic slices (8 × 10 × 3 mm) were produced and allocated among four groups according to the surface treatment: Cont = no treatment, HA = 10% hydrofluoric acid applied for 60 seconds, PA = 37% phosphoric acid applied for 60 seconds and CJ = air abrasion with silica particle coated alumina (Cojet Sand, 3M ESPE, 30 μm/2.8 bar). As a control group, eight blocks of feldspathic ceramic (8 × 10 × 3 mm) were etched by hydrofluoric acid for 60 seconds (VMII). After the surface treatments, the ceramic slices were silanized (except the Cont group) and adhesively cemented to composite resin blocks (8 × 10 × 3 mm ) with a load of 750 g (polymerized for 40 seconds each side). The cemented blocks were cut into beams (bonded surface area of ∼1 mm(2)). Half of the beams were aged (thermocycling of 5°C-55°C/6000 cycles + water storage at 37°C/60 days), and the other half were tested immediately after being cut. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (non-aged groups) and by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey test (aged groups; α=0.05%). The mode of failure was classified by stereomicroscopy. The surface treatment significantly affected the bond strength in each set of groups: non-aged (p=0.001) and aged (p=0.001). Before being aged, samples in the CJ, HA, and PA groups achieved the highest bond strength values. However, after being aged, only those in the HA group remained with the highest bond strength values. Adhesive failure was found most often. In conclusion, hydrofluoric acid etching should be used for surface conditioning of the studied hybrid ceramic.",2016,1,0,

Garoushi", Dent Mater J," The aim was to determine the fracture-behavior of incisors restored with different post-core foundations and crown made of conventional composite (PFC, G-aenial Anterior). Forty bovine-incisors were cut and divided into 5 groups. Group A had teeth restored using fiber-post and Gradia Core as core build-up and crown of PFC. Group B contained teeth restored with fiber-post and core made of everX Flow and crown of PFC. In Group C, the teeth were restored with everX Flow as post-core and crown of PFC. Group D, post-core-crown restorations were indirectly made from CERASMART. Group E, teeth were restored with Gradia Core as post-core and crown of PFC. Restored teeth were statically-loaded until fracture. ANOVA revealed that restoration technique significantly affected load-bearing capacity (p<0.05).

132, Effect of Different Computer-aided Design/Computer-aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) Materials and Thicknesses on the Fracture Resistance of Occlusal Veneers,"J. P. Andrade, D. Stona, H. R. Bittencourt, G. A. Borges, L. H. J. Burnett and A. M. Spohr", Oper Dent," The aim was to evaluate, in vitro, the influence of different computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials (IPS e.max CAD, Vita Enamic, and Lava Ultimate) and thicknesses (0.6 mm and 1.5 mm) on the fracture resistance of occlusal veneers. Sixty human third molars were prepared to simulate advanced erosion of the occlusal surface, and the teeth were randomly divided into six experimental groups (n=10) according to the material and thickness used to build the veneers. Ten sound teeth formed the control group. The veneers were adhesively luted and submitted to mechanical cyclic loading (1 million cycles at 200-N load). The fracture resistance test was performed in a universal testing machine. The failures were classified as ""reparable"" and ""irreparable."" According to two-way analysis of variance and the Tukey test, the interaction (material × thickness) was significant ( p=0.013). The highest fracture resistance was obtained for IPS e.max CAD at a 1.5-mm thickness (4995 N) and was significantly higher compared to the other experimental groups ( p<0.05). The lowest fracture resistance was obtained for Vita Enamic at 0.6 mm (2973 N), although this resistance was not significantly different from those for IPS e.max CAD at 0.6 mm (3067 N), Lava Ultimate at 0.6 mm (3384 N), Vita Enamic at 1.5 mm (3540 N), and Lava Ultimate at 1.5 mm (3584 N) ( p>0.05). The experimental groups did not differ significantly from the sound teeth (3991 N) ( p>0.05). The failures were predominantly repairable. The occlusal veneers of IPS e.max CAD, Vita Enamic, and Lava Ultimate, with thicknesses of 0.6 mm and 1.5 mm, obtained fracture resistances similar to those associated with sound teeth.",2018,0,0,

Peutzfeldt and A. Lussi", Dent Mater J," The aim was to investigate dentin bond strength of two resin-ceramic materials and five cements after 24 h and six months storage. Cylinders (n=15/group) of Lava Ultimate (3M ESPE) and VITA ENAMIC (VITA Zahnfabrik) were cemented to mid-coronal dentin of 300 extracted human molars with RelyX Ultimate (3M ESPE), PANAVIA F2.0 (Kuraray), Variolink II (Ivoclar Vivadent), els cem (Saremco Dental), or Ketac Cem Plus (3M ESPE). Shear bond strength (SBS) was measured after 24 h or six months storage (37°C, 100% humidity) and statistically analyzed (significance level: α=0.05). SBS varied markedly between Lava Ultimate and VITA ENAMIC, between the five cements, and between storage of either 24 h or six months. After six months, SBS was highest when Lava Ultimate was cemented with RelyX Ultimate and when VITA ENAMIC was cemented with RelyX Ultimate or with Variolink II.

167, Effect of surface treatment on the micro-shear bond strength to zirconia,E. Tashkandi, Saudi Dent J," The constant quest for finding the ultimate esthetic dental restorative material has led to numerous alternatives. These materials, in addition to possessing optical properties simulating natural teeth, should also have physical properties that can withstand the harsh oral environment. Due to their greater toughness, zirconium oxide materials have been used as a core material for all-ceramic restorations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the resin-composite micro-shear bond strength to zirconia using different techniques of surface treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fully sintered zirconia (LAVA, 3M-ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) discs were used in combination with resin-composite (Filtek Supreme, 3M-ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) discs and divided into four groups of surface treatments. The micro-shear bond strength was measured by applying an axial load on the bonded interface until failure occurred. Failure load (N) was determined and the samples were examined under a SEM and the failure type was identified. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data with the level of significance α = 0.05. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed significant difference between the different tested surface treatments with the group using sandblasting and coated with an experimental primer showing the highest failure load and a cohesive fracture pattern. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this in vitro study the use of an experimental primer achieved a better bond strength in combination with air-abrasion particles.",2009,0,0,
7, [How successful can discolored teeth be esthetically restored with monolithic restorative materials - a case report],"A. J. Roesner, S. Hahnel, S. Max Klose and A. Rauch", Swiss Dent J," The discoloration of enamel and dentin often has a lasting negative impact on the esthetic appearance. The current clinical case report illustrates which results can be achieved by supplying a patient with restorations fabricated from translucent tooth-colored materials for a traumatically damaged and discolored anterior tooth. A 20-year-old patient sought dental care due to a severe discrepancy in color and shape of tooth 11. As internal bleaching did not reveal a satisfying esthetic outcome, consequently we decided to supply the tooth with a 360° veneer. For material comparisons, the restorations were fabricated from five different monolithic materials. The preparation was performed following the guidelines for 360° veneers, featuring a circular thickness of 0.9 mm. The selected materials included indirect resin composite (Grandio blocs LT, VOCO), feldspathic ceramic (VITABLOCS Mark II LT, VITA Zahnfabrik), leucite-reinforced glass ceramic (IPS Empress CAD LT, Ivoclar Vivadent), lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max CAD LT, Ivoclar Vivadent), and zirconia with 5 mol% yttrium oxide (VITA YZ XT Multicolor LT, VITA Zahnfabrik). The materials were compared for the parameters profitability, esthetics, and patient satisfaction. With a thin layer thickness (0.8-0.9 mm circular), the tooth discoloration could not be adequately covered by any of the 360° veneers. After more extensive preparation, providing a circular thickness of the restoration up to 1.5 mm, all five monolithic materials as well as an additional individually veneered zirconium dioxide crown, serving as a reference, could achieve a satisfactory result. However, the overall esthetic appearance was completely rounded off by the individualized zirconium dioxide crown.",2021,0,1,

Yatani", Dent Mater J," The effect of cleaner containing 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) for removing temporary cement remnants on dentin surface was evaluated. Flat dentin surfaces were wet-polished (Co) and HY-BOND temporary cement hard (Shofu) was applied to the surface. This temporary cement was removed using an air-scaler (Sc), brush (Br), or phosphoric acid and NaOCl (NC). A prototype cleaner containing MDP (Kuraray Noritake Dental, Tokyo, Japan) was used with agitation mode (MC+AG). KATANA Avencia block (Kuraray Noritake Dental) was luted with SA Cement Plus Automix (Kuraray Noritake Dental). Co showed significantly higher bond strength than Sc or Br (p<0.001 each). Bond strengths with NC (p=0.99) and MC+AG (p=0.38) did not differ significantly from that with Co. Transmission electron microscopy revealed sufficient interaction of MC+AG.

Manabe", Dent Mater J," The effect of etching for 90 s with low concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0%) of hydrofluoric acid (HF) on the adhesiveness of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) resin blocks [CERASMART (CS), SHOFU BLOCK HC (HC), KATANA AVENCIA Block(KA), and VITA ENAMIC (EN)] was investigated. Energy dispersive spectroscopy revealed that the silicon content of HC, KA, and EN groups remained almost constant with HF etching of ≤4%. HF etching increased the surface roughness of all blocks. The HF concentration resulting in the highest shear bond strength in each group was as follows: CS (2.0%), HC (3.0%), KA (3.5%) and EN (0.5%). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the bonding interface of etched surfaces differed significantly from that of airborne-particle abrasion surfaces. Thus, low concentration HF etching is effective for surface treatment of CAD/CAM resin blocks. The etching effect and optimum HF concentration differ with the block composition and structure.",2020,0,0,

Valandro", Braz Oral Res," The effects of several ceramic surface treatments on bond strength of a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network and resin composite as repair material were evaluated. CAD-CAM blocks of a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (Vita Enamic) were sliced and subjected to aging process, followed by embedding in acrylic resin. The bonding/repair area was treated as follows (n = 30): C- without treatment; UA- universal adhesive application; FM- 10% hydrofluoric acid and silane application; OM-airborne-particle abrasion with aluminum oxide and silane application; RP- tribochemical silica coating; and CA- surface grinding and application of universal adhesive. Composite resin cylinders were made on the treated surface. Specimens from each group were assigned randomly to two subgroups (n = 15) considering storage condition: Baseline (shear tests after 48 hours) or Storage (tests after 6 months under distilled water). The treated surfaces were analyzed by goniometry, roughness, and SEM. Two-way ANOVA and 1-way ANOVA were applied to analyze the bond data and roughness / contact angle data, respectively, followed by Tukey's test (α = 5%). Surface treatments and storage conditions affected bond strengths (p < 0.01). Surface grinding (CA) followed by universal adhesive promoted the highest value of bond strength (14.5 ± 4.8 MPa for baseline, 8.5 ± 3.4 MPa for storage) and the roughest ceramic surface. Grinding with silicon carbide paper (simulating diamond bur) followed by the application of a universal adhesive system is the best option for repairing fractures of the polymer-infiltrated ceramic network.",2018,1,0,

Crowns with thicknesses 0.5/1.0/1.5 mm were fabricated with CEREC and adhesively seated to dies fabricated with stereolithography technology (n=144). Thermomechanical loading and fractural loading was performed. Statistical analysis was done with one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Scheffé test. For 1.5 mm, all crowns survived fatigue testing, for 1.0 mm, survival was 100% only for materials e.max CAD and Suprinity. For 0.5 mm, best survival rate was 37.5% for Suprinity. Maximum fractural loading significantly varied among the groups. For 0.5 mm, highest value was found for Suprinity (660.1 N). Mark II showed lowest values for 1.0 mm (482.0 N), and 1.5 mm groups (634.8 N). e.max CAD showed highest values for 1.0 mm (774.2 N), and 1.5 mm groups (1,240.8 N).",2017,1,0,
468, Stress distribution difference between Lava Ultimate full crowns and IPS e.max CAD full crowns on a natural tooth and on tooth-shaped implant abutments,I. Krejci and R. Daher, Odontology," The goal of this short communication is to present finite element analysis comparison of the stress distribution between CAD/CAM full crowns made of Lava Ultimate and of IPS e.max CAD, adhesively luted to natural teeth and to implant abutments with the shape of natural teeth. Six 3D models were prepared using a 3D content-creating software, based on a micro-CT scan of a human mandibular molar. The geometry of the full crown and of the abutment was the same for all models representing Lava Ultimate full crowns (L) and IPS e.max CAD full crowns (E) on three different abutments: prepared natural tooth (n), titanium abutment (t) and zirconia abutment (z). A static load of 400 N was applied on the vestibular and lingual cusps, and fixtures were applied to the base of the models. After running the static linear analysis, the post-processing data we analyzed. The stress values at the interface between the crown and the abutment of the Lt and Lz groups were significantly higher than the stress values at the same interface of all the other models. The high stress concentration in the adhesive at the interface between the crown and the abutment of the Lava Ultimate group on implants might be one of the factors contributing to the reported debondings of crowns.",2017,0,0,

Pini", J Biol Regul Homeost Agents," The laser welding of biological tissues is a particular use of lasers in surgery. The technique has been proposed since the 1970s for surgical applications, such as repairing blood vessels, nerves, tendons, bronchial fistulae, skin and ocular tissues. In vascular surgery, two procedures have been tested and optimized in animal models, both ex vivo and in vivo, in order to design different approaches for blood vessels anastomoses and for the repair of vascular lesions: the laser-assisted vascular anastomosis (LAVA) and the laser-assisted vessel repair (LAVR). Sealing tissues by laser may overcome the problems related to the use of conventional closuring methods that are generally associated with various degrees of vascular wall damage that can ultimately predispose to vessel thrombosis and occlusion. In fact, the use of a laser welding technique provides several advantages such as simplification of the surgical procedure, reduction of the operative time, suppression of bleeding, and may guarantee an optimal healing process of vascular structures, very similar to restitutio ad integrum. Despite the numerous preclinical studies performed by several research groups, the clinical applications of laser-assisted anastomosis or vessel repair are still far off. Substantial breakthrough in the laser welding of biological tissues may come from the advent of nanotechnologies. Herein we describe the present status and the future perspectives in laser welding of vascular structures.",2011,0,0,

Hickel", Int J Comput Dent," The material and antagonist wear of two CAD/CAM ceramic materials, the laboratory-processed IPS Empress ceramic, and the composite mill block material MZ100 were tested in an artificial wear simulator with human enamel as the antagonistic material. The material samples underwent 50,000 test cycles (1 cycle per second, 50 N) in distilled water. The wear of the material samples and of the opposing enamel was documented after 30,000 and 50,000 cycles with replicas, digitized, and evaluated with a 3D evaluation system. The loss of volume and height caused by wear was calculated. No significant difference between the ceramic materials could be found either in the amount of material or in the amount of antagonist wear. The material wear of MZ100 differed significantly from Vita Mark II only in terms of volume loss. Regarding height loss, MZ100 exhibited a significantly higher wear than all ceramic materials. The wear of the enamel antagonists does not differ significantly between the ceramic materials. With MZ100, however, a significantly smaller amount of enamel wear was found when compared with Empress and Vita Mark II. Despite the highest material wear, MZ100 had the lowest material wear rate, the lowest enamel wear rate, and the lowest total wear rate. The laboratory-processed IPS Empress material had a clearly higher material wear rate than the CAD/CAM materials.",2001,1,1,
231, Forensic applications: Fluorescence properties of tooth-coloured restorative materials using a fluorescence DSLR camera,"R. Kiran, L. J. Walsh, A. Forrest, M. Tennant and J. Chapman", Forensic Sci Int," The objective of this study was to compare the fluorescence properties of dry and wet samples of contemporary tooth-coloured restorative materials using a fluorescence based DSLR camera and a variety of LEDs emitting different wavelengths of visible light as excitation sources. The materials examined included resin composites; ceramics and hybrid restorative materials such as ormocers, Vita Enamic™ and resin reinforced glass-ionomer cements. The levels of fluorescence for each sample under different combinations of incident light wavelengths and filters was analysed by using histogram data for colour channels from Adobe Photoshop software. Fluorescence patterns were influenced by water sorption of the materials. UV-A/Violet light (405±nm) produced the greatest range of luminosity values (10-204) amongst the tooth-coloured restorative materials, and showed the greatest differences between restorations and tooth structure. The best filter combinations with violet light were orange or yellow filters. Under ultraviolet excitation, Fuji VIII A2 exhibited a unique bright pink fluorescence emission, while VitaEnamic™, ormocer and glass-ionomer cements emitted bluish-pink fluorescence emissions. In conclusion, restorative materials exhibited varied emission pattern under UV-A (405nm) light, which enables their detection and differentiation from natural tooth structure.",2017,0,0,

Mainjot", J Dent Res," The objective of this study was to evaluate the interfacial fracture toughness (IFT) of composite cement with dispersed filler (DF) versus polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) composite blocks after 2 different surface pretreatments using the notchless triangular prism (NTP) test. Two DFs (Cerasmart [CRT] and Lava Ultimate [LVA]), 2 PICNs (Enamic [ENA] and experimental PICN [EXP]), and e.max CAD lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (EMX, control) prism samples were bonded to their counterparts with Variolink Esthetic DC composite cement after either hydrofluoric acid etching (HF) or gritblasting (GR). Both procedures were followed by silanization. All samples ( n = 30 per group) were thermocycled (10,000 cycles) and tested for their IFT in a water bath at 36°C. Moreover, representative samples from each group were subjected to a developed interfacial area ratio (Sdr) measurement by profilometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization. EXP-HF gave the highest IFT (1.85 ± 0.39 MPa·m(1/2)), followed by EMX-HF and ENA-HF, while CRT-HF gave the lowest (0.15 ± 0.22 MPa·m(1/2)). PICNs gave significantly better results with HF, and DF showed better results with GR. A 2-way analysis of variance indicated that there were significantly higher IFT and Sdr for PICNs than for DF. A positive correlation ( r² = 0.872) was found between IFT and Sdr. SEM characterization showed the specific microstructure of the surface of etched PICNs, indicating the presence of a retentive polymer-based honeycomb structure. Etching of the typical double-network microstructure of PICNs causes an important increase in the Sdr and IFT, while DF should be gritblasted. DF exhibited significantly lower Sdr and IFT values than PICNs. The present results show the important influence of the material class and surface texture, and consequently the micromechanical bond, on the adhesive interface performance of CAD-CAM composites.",2018,1,1,

Coronal dentin from 108 molars were divided into nine groups (n = 12) depending on the adhesive/resin-cement (A-C) assigned. Lava™ Ultimate (4 × 10 × 10 mm) was cemented according to different strategies: IDS1(cementation after dentin sealing), DDS (dentin sealing and cementation at 2-weeks), IDS2 (immediate dentin sealing and cementation at 2-weeks). Samples were sectioned and tested until failure to determine the µTBS. Failure mode was categorized as dentin/cement (DC), at Lava™ Ultimate/cement (LC) and hybrid (H). Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests and influence of the type of failure on the µTBS by survival analysis with competing risk was explored. Mostly, µTBS values were equal or higher in IDS2 than DDS. In general, A-Cs that showed higher µTBS, have high percentages of LC failure. Survival analysis with competing risk between DC + H and LC values showed that some A-Cs would significantly increase the µTBS values for IDS2. A-Cs with the highest adhesion values showed a high percentage of fractures at the LC interface, suggesting that the adhesion at the adhesive/dentin interface would be higher.",2021,0,0,

One hundred and eighty specimens (4X1.5mm) of each material (Maxcem Elite, NX3 Nexus and Vita Enamic) were made and randomly distributed in twelve groups (n=15) according to the material and biodegradation method. The specimens were then submitted to the following challenges: storage in distilled water 37 ºC for 24 h or 7 days, storage for 7 days, at 37 ºC, in stimulated saliva or in situ. The in situ stage corresponded to the preparation of 15 intraoral palatal devices, used for 7 days. Each device presented 3 niches, where a sample of each materials was accommodated. Specimens from both saliva and in situ groups suffered a cariogenic challenge, corresponding to the application of a solution of 20% of sucrose, 10 times throughout each day. After each biodegradation method, the surface roughness (Ra), Vickers hardness (VHN) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyzes were performed. The data collected were evaluated by Levene test, two-way ANOVA and Tukey`s test (α=5%). The in situ challenge promoted the greater biodegradation, regardless of the material. Regarding the materials, the Vita Enamic VHN was negatively affected by all biodegradation methods and the Nexus NX3 presented better performance than the self-adhesive cement tested.

329, Internal Fit and Marginal Gap Evaluation of Zirconia Copings Using Microcomputed Tomography: An In Vitro Analysis,"A. ArRejaie, H. Alalawi, F. A. Al-Harbi, R. Abualsaud and A. M. Al-Thobity", Int J Periodontics Restorative Dent," The purpose of this in vitro study was to measure the marginal and internal fit of single-unit all-ceramic zirconia copings (ZCs) fabricated through three different computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) systems using microcomputed tomography (microCT). A total of 10 ZCs were produced for each experimental group. Scanning of the stainless steel (SS) model with its respective copings was conducted with a SkyScan machine. DataViewer software was used to acquire cross-sectional images. Locations of cross-sections for all specimens were standardized to reduce errors. Seven different cross-section locations were selected: four transverse and three sagittal. Adobe Photoshop CS3 was used for the measurements. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc test were used for the statistical analysis for each group. In addition, t test (α = .05) was used to compare values at each measurement location for the different groups. The results of this study show significant differences in the precision of fit of the experimental groups at the axio-occlusal transition (AOT) location, with a significant gap present in the DeguDent CAD/CAM System compared to the other two systems. Tukey test results indicate a significant difference in the marginal gap between the DeguDent CAD/CAM System and KaVo Everest Dental CAD/CAM System (P = .004). In addition, there is a significant difference in gap size values in the sagittal sections distal to the midline between the DeguDent CAD/CAM System and the Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM System (P = .002). The different CAD/CAM systems showed a clinically acceptable internal fit and marginal adaptation. Different levels of fit were found between the experimental groups. Marginal adaptation was the best in all experimental groups. The gap at the AOT area varied among the three groups, with the DeguDent CAD/CAM System showing the greatest value.",2018,0,0,
530, Wear Properties of Different Additive Restorative Materials Used for Onlay/Overlay Posterior Restorations,"F. De Angelis, C. D'Arcangelo, N. Malíšková, L. Vanini and M. Vadini", Oper Dent," The purpose of this laboratory study was to compare the two-body wear resistance of different restorative materials commonly used for the indirect restoration of posterior teeth. The tested materials, based on ceramic (Imagine Press X, IPS e.max CAD, Milled Celtra Duo, Glaze-Fired Celtra Duo, Vita Mark II) and composite (Enamel Plus HRi, Enamel Plus HRi Bio-Function, Filtek Supreme XTE, Lava Ultimate), were compared with the wear properties of a type III gold alloy (Aurocast 8). Flat samples were prepared with a 6-mm thickness (n=10). Composite samples were tested after a heat polymerization cycle. All samples were exposed to a two-body wear test in a dual axis chewing simulator performing over 120,000 loading cycles. The opposing abrader cusps were fabricated from yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal. The vertical substance loss (mm) and the volume loss (mm(3)) were recorded, as was the wear of the antagonist cusp (mm). Mean values were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences among materials were detected. The heat-cured resin-based composite material Enamel Plus Bio-Function and the type III gold alloy demonstrated similar mean values for wear depth and volumetric loss.",2020,0,1,
179, Effectiveness of current adhesive systems when bonding to CAD/CAM indirect resin materials: A review of 32 publications,"A. Mine, T. Kabetani, A. Kawaguchi-Uemura, M. Higashi, Y. Tajiri, R. Hagino, D. Imai, M. Yumitate, S. Ban, M. Matsumoto and H. Yatani", Jpn Dent Sci Rev," The purpose of this review was to assess the available literature regarding bonding between current adhesive systems and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) indirect resin materials, to provide clinicians with a comparative overview of the relevant bonding procedures. An electronic search was performed through PubMed based on the keywords CAD/CAM and dental bonding. Additional relevant literature was obtained from the citations in the articles. A total of 313 papers were identified, of which 281 were excluded as being unsuitable, and an additional 3 papers were identified, giving a total of 32 articles that are included in this review. Based on this survey, it is recommended that microretentive surfaces should be generated by either blasting or hydrofluoric acid etching. This initial process should be followed by silanization to ensure chemical adhesion prior to bonding to CAD/CAM indirect resin composite materials (including Lava Ultimet, KATANA AVENCIA block, Gradia Block, Cerasmart, Paradigm, and Block HC) and CAD/CAM polymer-infiltrated ceramics (such as Vita Enamic). The use of materials containing methyl methacrylate (MMA) also appears to improve the bonding of CAD/CAM poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resin materials (including XHIPC-CAD/CAM, artBloc Temp, and Telio).",2019,1,1,
16, A comparative study of sliding wear of nonmetallic dental restorative materials with emphasis on micromechanical wear mechanisms,"N. D. Dupriez, A. K. von Koeckritz and K. H. Kunzelmann", J Biomed Mater Res B Appl Biomater," The purpose of this study is to investigate the in vitro tribological behavior of modern nonmetallic restorative materials. Specimen prepared of IPS e.max Press lithium disilicate glass ceramic, IPS Empress Esthetic leucite-reinforced glass ceramic, Everest ZS Blanks yttria-stabilized zirconia and Lava Ultimate composite were subjected to wear using a wear machine designed to simulate occlusal loads. The wear of the investigated materials and antagonists were evaluated by a three-dimensional surface scanner. The quantitative wear test results were used to compare and rank the materials. Specimens were divided into two groups with steatite and alumina antagonists. For each antagonist material an analysis of variance was applied. As a post hoc test of the significant differences, Tukey's honest significant difference test was used. With steatite antagonist: wear of zirconia < wear of leucite-reinforced ceramic < wear of lithium disilicate ceramic < wear of Lava Ultimate composite. No significant wear difference was found for steatite antagonist. The wear of IPS e.max Press and Lava Ultimate against hard alumina was found to be twice lower as compared to their wear when opposing to steatite. The differences were associated with materials mechanical properties (hardness and fracture toughness) and with materials microstructure. Wear mechanisms are discussed.",2015,0,1,
267, Hydroxyapatite coating effect on the bond strength between CAD/CAM materials and a resin cement,"O. Sagsoz, N. Polat Sagsoz, M. T. Yurtcan and N. Ozcelik", Odontology," The purpose of this study was to evaluate the bond strength between CAD/CAM materials and a resin cement using hydroxyapatite coating as a surface treatment method. Different surface treatments (Control, no treatment-C; Sandblasting-SB; Hydrofluoric acid etching-HF; applying tooth desensitizer-TeM; applying topical crème-ToM, HAp coating with Pulse Laser Deposition technique-PLD) were applied to three different CAD/CAM materials (LAVA Ultimate, VITA Enamic, and Cerec Blocs). After surface treatments, a universal adhesive (Single Bond Universal, 3M ESPE) was applied and adhesive resin (Rely X Ultimate, 3M ESPE) were cemented on each material surface using plastic tubes (4 mm in diameter). The shear bond strength values were measured using a universal testing machine. Scanning electron microscope analysis were performed to evaluate failure modes and effects of surface treatments. Obtained data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test (p = 0.05). The bond strength of PLD groups were significantly higher than other groups in resin-ceramics (p < 0.05). In Cerec Blocs, HF resulted significantly higher bond strength than other groups (p < 0.05). SEM analysis of surface treatment methods (except TeM and ToM) revealed an increase in surface alterations compared to control groups. Failure modes were dominantly adhesive in groups C, TeM, and ToM, whereas mostly mix or cohesive failures were observed in PLD, HF, and SB. Hydroxyapatite coating with PLD technique exhibited promising bond strength results for CAD/CAM resin-ceramics. HAp coating can be used as a replacement for hydrofluoric acid etching and sandblasting in CAD/CAM resin-ceramic materials to obtain better bond strength values.",2019,0,0,

The gloss and surface roughness were quantified before and after a toothbrush dentifrice abrasion test; the results were compared to the gloss and surface roughness of a ceramic CAD/CAM block. Knoop hardness was determined before abrasion test. The results were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey HSD, and Dunnett t test (p<0.05). The rank order of Knoop hardness was as follows: Vita Mark II>Vita Enamic>Gradia block>Shofu Block HC, Lava Ultimate≥Katana Avencia block≥Cerasmart. After toothbrush abrasion, a significant difference in the gloss unit was detected between the Shofu Block HC material and the ceramic block.

475, Surface properties and gloss of CAD/CAM composites after toothbrush abrasion testing,"K. Okamura, H. Koizumi, A. Kodaira, H. Nogawa and T. Yoneyama", J Oral Sci," The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surface properties and gloss of CAD/CAM composites after toothbrush abrasion testing. Four CAD/CAM composites for molars (Cerasmart 300, Estelite P block, Katana Avencia P block, and KZR-CAD HR3 Gammatheta), one CAD/CAM composite for premolars (Shofu Block HC Hard), and one feldspathic ceramics (Vitablocs Mark II) were assessed. Knoop hardness number, gloss, and surface roughness (Ra, Rz, and Sa) were measured before and after toothbrush abrasion testing. Knoop hardness number values were in the order Vitablocs Mark II > Katana Avencia P block > Estelite P Block > Shofu Block HC Hard > Cerasmart 300 > KZR-CAD HR3 Gammatheta. After testing, the gloss of Estelite P block and KZR-CAD HR3 Gammatheta was greatly decreased and surface roughness was greatly increased.

Kurbad, Int J Comput Dent," The use of materials with elastic properties for the fabrication of dental implant superstructures seems to be a promising way to reduce the functional occlusal forces on implants. Vita Enamic (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen), a hybrid ceramic material for CAD/CAM technology, is available in a special form that can be relatively easily combined with titanium (Ti) base connectors for the fabrication of abutment crowns and mesostructures. Thus, an easily manageable method is available for reducing peak loads on dental implant fixtures.

194, Erosion of CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel: An in situ/in vivo study,"H. Yang, D. W. Hong, T. Attin, H. Cheng and H. Yu", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," This in situ/in vivo study aimed to evaluate the effects of erosion on the surface microhardness, substance loss, and surface roughness of CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel. This study used a 2-treatment (14 days each) crossover design with 8 healthy volunteers. Each volunteer wore an intraoral appliance containing 3 CAD/CAM restorative material specimens [IPS e.max CAD, Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM Restorative, and a poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) block for CAD/CAM] and 1 human enamel specimen. The specimens were subjected to in vivo erosion cycles by rinsing with 150 ml of cola drink (4 × 5 min/day) for 14 days. The surface microhardness, substance loss, and surface roughness of the specimens were measured at baseline (T1), day 7 (T2) and day 14 (T3). The data were statistically analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05). After erosion, significant increases in substance loss and surface roughness were observed for enamel, though the surface roughness and substance profile of the tested restorative materials remained unchanged. Erosion significantly decreased the surface microhardness of all materials. For IPS e.max and Lava Ultimate, a significantly higher percentage of surface microhardness loss (%SMH(l)) was found at T3 than at T2, while no significant difference was found between T2 and T3 for enamel and the PMMA block. In conclusion, CAD/CAM restorative materials showed smaller changes in surface roughness and the surface profile than human enamel after in situ/in vivo erosion. However, CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel showed similar changes in surface microhardness after in situ/in vivo erosion.",2020,0,0,
386, Microtensile bond strengths of adhesively bonded polymer-based CAD/CAM materials to dentin,"N. Capa, E. C. Say, C. Celebi and A.

CAD/CAM materials were cut into slabs and divided into five groups according to the surface pre-treatments applied: Silane Primer, OptiBond XTR adhesive, Silane Primer+OptiBond XTR adhesive, Single Bond Universal (SBU), and RelyX Ceramic Primer+SBU. The LVU and CS specimens were bonded to the mid-coronal dentin of 50 non-carious human molars using NX3 resin cement with OptiBond XTR or RelyX Ultimate with SBU. µTBS was evaluated after 5,000 thermocycling and analysed with three-way-ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's tests (p<0.05). The µTBS was significantly influenced by the type of CAD/CAM material (p<0.0001) surface pre-treatments (p<0.05) and resin cements (p<0.05). Regardless of the pre-treatments and resin cements, bonding of the composite CAD/CAM material to dentin was higher than the resin nano-ceramic material.",2019,1,1,
227, Fatigue strength of several dental ceramics indicated for CAD-CAM monolithic restorations,"G. Nishioka, C. Prochnow, A. Firmino, M. Amaral, M. A. Bottino, L. F. Valandro and M. Renata Marques de", Braz Oral Res," This in vitro study evaluated the fatigue strength of different ceramic materials indicated for monolithic restorations. Disc-shaped specimens were made according to ISO 6872 from five different ceramic materials: feldspathic ceramic (FC), polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PIC), lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (ZLS), and high translucent tetragonal zirconia polycrystals doped by yttrium (YZ-HT). After obtaining the mean of each material (n = 5) from monotonic load-to-failure tests, specimens (n = 20) were subjected to fatigue tests (staircase method) using a biaxial flexural setup (piston-on-three-balls), to determine the fatigue strength. The parameters used for fatigue tests were: 100,000 cycles at 10 Hz, initial load of ~ 60% of mean load-to-failure, and step size of 5% of the initial load (specific for each ceramic material). Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni's test (α = 0.05) were used to analyze the fatigue strength data. Fatigue strength (MPa) of the materials was statistically different among each other as follows: YZ-HT (370.2 ± 38.7) > LD (175.2 ± 7.5) > ZLS (152.1 ± 7.5) > PIC (81.8 ± 3.9) > FC (50.8 ± 1.9). Thus, it can be concluded that, in terms of fatigue, high translucent polycrystalline zirconia is the best choice for monolithic restorations as it bears the highest load before cracking/fracturing.",2018,1,0,
195, Erosion of CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel: An in vitro study,"H. Yang, Z. C. Lu, T. Attin and H. Yu", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," This in vitro study used the same frequency and duration of acid contact as a previous in situ/in vivo study to evaluate the effect of erosion on CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel and to compare the effects of in vitro and in situ/in vivo acid challenges on CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel. The CAD/CAM restorative materials (IPS e.max CAD, Lava Ultimate, and PMMA block) and human enamel were eroded by immersion in 150 ml of cola drink for 14 days (4 × 5 min/day). The surface microhardness and surface roughness of the specimens were measured at baseline (T1), day 7 (T2), and day 14 (T3). The substance losses were measured at T2 and T3. The data were statistically analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni's test (α = 0.05). Erosion significantly decreased the surface microhardness of the CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel (all P < 0.001). The overall percentage of surface microhardness loss (%SMH(l)) of the PMMA block and enamel due to in vitro erosion was significantly higher than that due to in situ/in vivo erosion (P = 0.02 and P < 0.001, respectively). Consistent with in situ/in vivo erosion, the surface roughness and profile of the tested restorative materials remained unchanged after in vitro erosion. A significant increase in the surface roughness and substance loss was observed for enamel after in vitro erosion (all P < 0.001). The overall substance loss of enamel due to in vitro erosion was significantly higher than that due to in situ/in vivo erosion (P < 0.001). In conclusion, erosion decreased the surface microhardness of the CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel. Moreover, erosion negatively influenced the substance loss and surface roughness of human enamel. For the substance loss of enamel and %SMH(l) of PMMA block and enamel, the in vitro erosive effects were approximately 1-2 times greater than the in situ/in vivo effects. However, for the surface roughness and profile of the CAD/CAM restorative materials, no significant difference was found between in vitro and in situ/in vivo erosion.",2021,0,0,
213," Failure Load and Fatigue Behavior of Monolithic Translucent Zirconia, PICN and Rapid-Layer Posterior Single Crowns on Zirconia Implants","F. A. Spitznagel, S. Röhrig, R. Langner and P. C. Gierthmuehlen", Materials (Basel)," This laboratory study aimed to evaluate the thermo-mechanical fatigue behavior and failure modes of monolithic and rapid-layer posterior single-crowns (SCs) supported by zirconia implants. METHODS: 120 all-ceramic crowns supported by one-piece zirconia implants (ceramic.implant; vitaclinical) were divided into five groups (n = 24 each): Group Z-HT: 3Y-TZP monolithic-zirconia (Vita-YZ-HT); Group Z-ST: 4Y-TZP monolithic-zirconia (Vita-YZ-ST); Z-XT: 5Y-TZP monolithic-zirconia (Vita-YZ-XT); Group E: monolithic-polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN,Vita-Enamic); Group RL (rapid layer): PICN-""table-top"" (Vita-Enamic), 3Y-TZP-framework (Vita-YZ-HT). Half of the specimens of each group (n = 12) were exposed to fatigue with cyclic mechanical loading (F = 198N, 1.2-million cycles) and simultaneous thermocycling (5-55 °C). Single-load-to-failure testing (Z010, Zwick) was performed for all specimens without/with fatigue application. Data analysis was performed using ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc test, two-sample t-test and Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05). RESULTS: All specimens survived fatigue exposure. Significant differences in failure loads were detected among groups (p ≤ 0.004). Materials Z-HT and Z-ST showed the highest failure loads followed by Z-XT, RL and E. The influence of fatigue was only significant for material RL. CONCLUSIONS: All types of tested materials exceeded clinically acceptable failure load values higher than 900N and can be recommended for clinical use. Z-HT and Z-ST appear to be highly reliable towards fatigue. Rapid-layer design of PICN and YZ-HT might be an interesting treatment concept for posterior implant SCs.",2021,1,0,
275, In Vitro Analysis of the Cytotoxicity of Indirect Restorative Materials,"M. Z. Scelza, I. P. Caldas, J. M. Mattos, F. Oliveira, W. Carvalho and G. G. Alves", Braz Dent J," This study aimed to compare the cytotoxicity of the Vita AC12, Lava Ultimate, Vita Enamic and InSync indirect restorative materials. Extracts of each material were prepared by incubation for 1, 7 and 40 days, with daily washing. Human gingival fibroblasts were exposed to the extracts, and cell viability was evaluated by sequential assessment of mitochondrial activity (XTT), membrane integrity (NRU) and cell density (CVDE). Extracts of polystyrene beads and latex fragments were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Differences between groups and experimental times were evaluated by analysis of variance. At the 24 h extraction, significant differences between the control and both Vita AC-12 and InSync were observed in the XTT assay (p<0.05), and between the control and both Enamic and Lava Ultimate, in the CVDE assay (p<0.05). AC12, Lava Ultimate, and InSync presented significantly lower cell viability than Enamic and the control group, in the NRU assay (p<0.05). The Vita Enamic and Lava Ultimate hybrid ceramic-like materials presented better biocompatibility at the 24 h extraction time point than the AC12 and InSync ceramic materials. However, a simulation of the removal of toxic components by biological fluids, conducted by using longer extraction times and daily washing, led to the absence of cytotoxicity in all the tested restorative materials. These findings can be viewed as positive for the clinical indication of these restorative materials, considering their contact with adjacent soft tissues for extended periods of time.",2018,1,0,
119, Effect of air-particle pressures on the surface topography and bond strengths of resin cement to the hybrid ceramics,"J. E. Kim, J. H. Kim, J. S. Shim, B. D. Roh and Y. Shin", Dent Mater J," This study aimed to determine the appropriate pressure for airborne-abrasion by comparing the shear bond strength values for different hybrid ceramic surfaces. Two materials were used to produce hybrid ceramic specimens: Lava Ultimate and MAZIC Duro. The group of specimens whose surfaces were not subjected to airborne-abrasion was set as the control group. In the experimental group, airborne-abrasion was performed at pressures of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 MPa. After the adhesive and resin cement was applied, an SBS test was performed. For the MAZIC Duro block, the SBS increased monotonically with the airborne-abrasion pressure increased, peaking at 0.3 MPa. For the Lava Ultimate block, the SBS increased as the airborne-abrasion pressure increased to 0.2 MPa, and then decreased in the 0.3-MPa group, thereby peaking at 0.2 MPa. This study has confirmed that the bonding strength varies with the material used even when applying the same surface treatment.",2017,1,0,
432, Repolishing in situ eroded CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel,"H. Yang, R. Chen, T. Attin, H. Cheng and H. Yu", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," This study aimed to evaluate the effects of repolishing on the surface microhardness (SMH), color change (ΔE), and translucency parameter (TP) of previously in situ eroded computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) restorative materials and human enamel. Each of 8 volunteers wore an intraoral appliance containing 3 CAD/CAM restorative material specimens (IPS e.max CAD lithium disilicate ceramic, Lava Ultimate hybrid ceramic, and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) block) and 1 human enamel specimen. The specimens were subjected to in situ erosion cycles by rinsing with a cola drink (4 × 5 min/day) for 14 days. After erosion, the specimens were polished with a silicone polishing system (Ceramister, Shofu Inc, Kyoto, Japan). The SMH and color of the specimens were determined at baseline (T1), after erosion (T2), and after repolishing (T3). The ΔE and TP values of the specimens were further calculated. The data were statistically analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni's test (α = 0.05). After erosion, a decrease in the SMH of the restorative materials and enamel was observed (all P < 0.001), and a decrease in the TP of the enamel was observed (P = 0.016). The ΔE values of the enamel (ΔE = 7.32) and Lava Ultimate (ΔE = 3.19) exceeded the clinically unacceptable threshold after erosion. After repolishing, the SMH of the restorative materials and enamel at T3 was significantly higher than that at T2 (all P < 0.001). No significant difference was found in the TP and ΔE values of the restorative materials and enamel between T2 and T3. In conclusion, erosion negatively affected the surface properties and appearance of the CAD/CAM restorative materials and human enamel. Repolishing contributed to restoring the compromised SMH of the eroded restorative materials and enamel to a certain extent. However, repolishing did not restore the color of the eroded restorative materials and enamel.",2021,1,0,
22, Accelerated loading frequency does not influence the fatigue behavior of polymer infiltrated ceramic network or lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations,"H. C. Velho, K. S. Dapieve, G. K. Rocha Pereira, S. Fraga, L. F. Valandro and A. B. Venturini", J Mech Behav Biomed Mater," This study aimed to evaluate the influence of loading frequency on the fatigue mechanical behavior of adhesively cemented polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) and lithium disilicate (LD) simplified monolithic restorations. Thirty (30) disc-shaped specimens (Ø = 10 mm; thickness = 1.0 mm) of each ceramic material (PICN - Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik or LD - IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) were produced and adhesively cemented onto dentin analogue discs made of fiber and epoxy resin material (Ø = 10 mm; thickness = 2.0 mm). PICN and LD cemented assemblies were randomly allocated into 2 groups (n = 15) according to the loading frequency used for the fatigue testing (20 Hz or 2 Hz), composing the PICN_20, PICN_2, LD_20 and LD_2 testing groups. Fatigue tests were run using the step-stress approach (initial load = 200 N; step-size = 100 N; 10,000 cycles per step) and the collected data (fatigue failure load - FFL and number of cycles for failure - CFF) were analyzed by survival tests (Kaplan Meier and Mantel-Cox) and Weibull analysis. Fractographic analysis of failed specimens were also performed. No statistically significant differences were detected in relation to FFL and CFF between the groups within the same ceramic material (PICN_20: 1127 N/102,667 cycles = PICN_2: 1120 N/102,000 cycles; LD_20: 980 N/88,000 cycles = LD_2: 900 N/80,000 cycles). All failures were radial cracks in the cementation surface. Therefore, the use of a 20 Hz loading frequency shows to be a viable alternative to accelerate cyclic fatigue tests without affecting the fatigue mechanical behavior and the failure pattern of simplified restorations made of lithium disilicate glass ceramic or polymer infiltrated ceramic network bonded to the dentin analogue.",2020,1,0,
445, Saliva Influence on the Mechanical Properties of Advanced CAD/CAM Composites for Indirect Dental Restorations,"T. Palacios, S. Tarancón, C. Abad and J. Y. Pastor", Polymers (Basel)," This study aims to evaluate the microstructural and mechanical properties of three commercial resin-based materials available for computer-aid design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-processed indirect dental restoration: Lava(TM) Ultimate Restorative (LU), 3M ESPE; Brilliant Crios (BC), COLTENE and Cerasmart(TM) (CS), GC Dental Product. The three types of resin-based composite CAD/CAM materials were physically and mechanically tested under two conditions: directly as received by the manufacturer (AR) and after storage under immersion in artificial saliva (AS) for 30 days. A global approximation to microstructure and mechanical behaviour was evaluated: density, hardness and nanohardness, nanoelastic modulus, flexural strength, fracture toughness, fracture surfaces, and microstructures and fractography. Moreover, their structural and chemical composition using X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were investigated. As a result, LU exhibited slightly higher mechanical properties, while the decrease of its mechanical performance after immersion in AS was doubled compared to BC and CS. Tests of pristine material showed 13 GPa elastic modulus, 150 MPa flexural strength, 1.0 MPa·m(1/2) fracture toughness, and 1.0 GPa hardness for LU, 11.4 GPa elastic modulus; 140 MPa flexural strength, 1.1 MPa·m(1/2) fracture toughness, and 0.8 GPa hardness for BC; and 8.3 GPa elastic modulus, 140 MPa flexural strength, 0.9 MPa·m(1/2) fracture toughness, and 0.7 GPa hardness for CS. These values were significantly reduced after one month of immersion in saliva. The interpretation of the mechanical results could suggest, in general, a better behaviour of LU compared with the other two despite it having the coarsest microstructure of the three studied materials. The saliva effect in the three materials was critically relevant for clinical use and must be considered when choosing the best solution for the restoration to be used.",2021,0,1,
331, Investigation on the Gradient Nanomechanical Behavior of Dental Fluorosis Enamel,"J. Min, P. Yu, Z. Xu, Z. Li, Q. Zhang, H. Yu and S. Gao", Nanoscale Res Lett," This study aims to investigate the gradient nanomechanical behavior of dental fluorosis enamel and provide appropriate selection criteria for restorative materials. The nanomechanical properties of the outer, middle, and inner layers of normal tooth enamel, mild dental fluorosis enamel, and severe dental fluorosis enamel were tested by nanoindentation under an applied load of 2000 μN and holding time of 30 s. The nanotribological properties were then evaluated through nanoscratch tests under an applied load of 1000 μN. In addition, the nanotribological property of the outer layer of dental fluorosis enamel was compared with that of four restorative materials, namely, lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), polymer-infiltrated-ceramic network (PICN), composite resin block (Lava™ ultimate), and conventional composite resin (Fltek™ Z350XT). The nanohardness and elastic modulus of mild dental fluorosis enamel increased from the outer to the middle layers and then decreased from the middle to the inner layers. By contrast, the changed displacement, friction coefficient, and nanoscratch depth and width decreased from the outer to the middle layers and then increased from the middle to the inner layers. In severe dental fluorosis enamel, nanohardness and elastic modulus increased from the outer to the inner layers, but the changed displacement, friction coefficient, and nanoscratch depth and width decreased from the outer to the inner layers. The nanoscratch depth and width of Lava™ ultimate were similar to those of the outer layer of the mild dental fluorosis enamel. The gradient nanomechanical behavior of dental fluorosis enamel significantly differed from that of normal tooth enamel. Dental materials with a wear resistance similar to that of the opposing enamel are a good choice for restoring dental fluorosis (trial registration: WCHSIRB-D-2014-126, registered 25 December 2014).",2018,1,1,
242, Fracture resistance and microleakage of endocrowns utilizing three CAD-CAM blocks,"H. M. El-Damanhoury, R. N. Haj-Ali and J. A. Platt", Oper Dent," This study assessed marginal leakage and fracture resistance of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) fabricated ceramic crowns with intracoronal extensions into the pulp chambers of endodontically treated teeth (endocrowns) using either feldspathic porcelain (CEREC Blocks [CB], Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany), lithium disilicate (e.max [EX], Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), or resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate [LU], 3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA).). Thirty extracted human permanent maxillary molars were endodontically treated. Standardized preparations were done with 2-mm intracoronal extensions of the endocrowns into the pulp chamber. Teeth were divided into three groups (n=10); each group was restored with standardized CAD/CAM fabricated endocrowns using one of the three tested materials. After cementation with resin cement, specimens were stored in distilled water at 37°C for one week, subjected to thermocycling, and immersed in a 5% methylene-blue dye solution for 24 hours. A compressive load was applied at 35 degrees to long axis of the teeth using a universal testing machine until failure. Failure load was recorded, and specimens were examined under a stereomicroscope for modes of failure and microleakage. Results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparison tests (α=0.05). LU showed significantly (p<0.05) higher fracture resistance and more favorable fracture mode (ie, fracture of the endocrown without fracture of tooth) as well as higher dye penetration than CB and EX. In conclusion, although using resin nanoceramic blocks for fabrication of endocrowns may result in better fracture resistance and a more favorable fracture mode than other investigated ceramic blocks, more microleakage may be expected with this material.",2015,1,0,

Lim", Materials (Basel)," This study compares the color stability of dental reinforced computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) hybrid composite blocks to that of regular blocks. One hundred fifty disc-type specimens (n = 15) were prepared from five sets of hybrid composite blocks (Cerasmart-200/Cerasmart-300, KZR-CAD HR/KZR-CAD HR3, Estelite Block/ Estelite-P Block, Avencia Block/Avencia-P Block, Mazic Duro/Duro Ace). The specimen color and translucency parameter (TP) were assessed using a spectrophotometer before and after immersion in staining solutions (water, 10% ethanol, simulated red wine). Changes in color (ΔE) and translucency (ΔTP) of specimens were calculated. The data were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc test (p < 0.05). Microstructural features of the hybrid composite blocks were also examined using FE-SEM. Immersion in deionized water or 10% ethanol made no significant color or translucency changes (except for Avencia-P Block); however, the simulated red wine caused significant changes to the color and translucency of almost all specimens, especially after 4 weeks of immersion. The reinforced hybrid blocks (except for Estelite-P Block and Duro Ace) showed lower color stability than corresponding regular blocks. Avencia-P Block showed significantly reduced color stability compared to Avencia Block. Even in deionized water and 10% ethanol, Avencia-P Block showed perceptible ΔE and decreased translucency. Estelite Block/ Estelite-P Block and Mazic Duro/Duro Ace showed better color stability than the other materials tested.",2020,0,1,

Elsaka, Odontology," This study evaluated the effect of four different surface treatments methods on the shear bond strength (SBS) of ceramic and metal brackets to Vita Enamic (VE) CAD/CAM hybrid ceramic. A total of 240 plates (10 mm × 10 mm × 3 mm) were cut from VE ceramic blocks and divided into two groups. In each group, four subgroups were prepared by hydrofluoric acid (HF); phosphoric acid (H3PO4); diamond ceramic grinding bur; and silica coating using CoJet system (CJ). Maxillary central incisor metal (Victory Series) and ceramic (Clarity) brackets were bonded with light-cure composite and then stored in artificial saliva for 1 week and thermocycled. The SBS test was performed, and the failure types were classified with adhesive remnant index scores. Surface morphology of the ceramic was characterized after treatment using a scanning electron microscope. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, Tukey HSD test, and Weibull analysis. SBS was significantly affected by the type of bracket and by type of treatment (P < 0.001). Specimens treated with CJ presented with significantly higher SBS compared to other groups (P < 0.05). Improvements in SBS values (MPa) were found in the following order: CJ > HF > Bur > H3PO4. Ceramic bracket showed higher SBS compared to metal bracket. Adhesive failures between the ceramic and composite resin were the predominant mode of failure in all groups. Surface treatment of VE CAD/CAM hybrid ceramic with silica coating enhanced the adhesion with ceramic and metal brackets.",2016,1,0,

The resin cement (RelyX Unicem 2, 3M ESPE) was applied to the diamond surface of a horizontal attenuated-total-reflectance unit and activated using one of following conditions: self-cure, direct light exposure, light exposure through indirect restorative materials (resin nano-ceramic: Lava Ultimate, 3M ESPE or feldspathic ceramic: Vita Blocks Mark II, Vita Zahnfabrik). Four thicknesses (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 mm) of each indirect material were analyzed, and the light-activation was performed using a blue LED light. Data (n=5) were analyzed by three-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc and Dunnett's tests (α=5%). No significant differences in DC were observed between indirect materials of similar thickness. All groups exhibited higher DC after 10 min than after 5 min. At both times points, the self-cure group exhibited significantly lower DC than all the light exposure groups. Only when the overlying indirect restoration had a thickness of 2 mm did DC decrease significantly. The presence of a thick, indirect restoration can decrease the DC of resin cement. DC after 10 min was higher than after 5 min. The self-cure mode yielded lower DC than the light-activating one.",2015,1,0,

Teoh", J Esthet Restor Dent," This study investigated the color (ΔE) and translucency changes (ΔTP) of CAD/CAM composites after exposure to staining solutions using both spectrophotometer and shade-matching device. Direct (Filtek Z350XT [ZT]), indirect (Shofu Ceramage [CE]) and CAD/CAM (Shofu HC Block [HC], Lava Ultimate [LU], Vita Enamic [EN]) composite specimens measuring 12 × 14 × 1.5 mm were fabricated, divided into five groups (n = 8), and immersed in cola, tea, coffee, red wine, distilled water (control) at 37°C for 7 days. Color parameters were determined with both spectrophotometer and shade-taking device at baseline and 1 week. Delta E (ΔE) with white and black backgrounds, and Delta TP (ΔTP) were computed. Statistical testing was performed with ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test (P < .05). Mean ΔE (white) values ranged from 0.20 ± 0.06 to 12.26 ± 1.95 while mean ΔE (black) varied from 0.22 ± 0.11 to 14.21 ± 2.37. Mean ΔTP values ranged from 0.13 ± 0.17 to -3.87 ± 2.16. CAD/CAM composites fared better in red wine than direct and indirect materials. Clinically perceptible color changes (ΔE > 3.3) were observed for almost all materials when exposed to wine, coffee and tea. Direct, indirect, and CAD/CAM composites are all susceptible to various degrees of discoloration and translucency changes after exposure to staining beverages. Red wine caused the most discoloration and translucency changes. Limitations of these materials must be considered when placing an aesthetic restoration. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Direct, indirect, and CAD/CAM composites are all susceptible to various degrees of discoloration and translucency changes after exposure to staining beverages. Red wine generally caused the most discoloration and translucency changes.

Thirty Paradigm blocks (Z100) were mounted in stone, with their top surfaces parallel to the mounting block. High C-factor (HC = 3.8) Class I cavity preparations were then prepared in 15 of the Paradigm blocks using a computer-controlled specimen former. Low C-factor (LC = 1.8) Class II cavity preparations were prepared in the remaining 15 blocks by sectioning them perpendicularly using a slow-speed diamond saw. Five samples, one from each experimental group (3 EASs x 2 C-factors), were prepared and stored in the dark for 48 hours in distilled water at 37 degrees C prior to MTBS testing on the third day and on the remainder of the samples (n = 30). Mode of fracture was determined with a stereomicroscope at 20-40x magnification. The findings of this study indicated that HC, in combination with HIP, had significantly lower bond strength (27.54 MPa) than LC with HIP (51.39 MPa). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between high and low C-factors with the other EASs (LOP or RMP). There was also no significant effect for EAS (HIP, RAMP and LOP), with C-factor (HC or LC) held constant. The HIP-HC group had the highest percentage of adhesive (20%) and mixed adhesive (50%) failures (70% total). Adhesive and mixed adhesive failures occurred in other groups, but with lower percentages (RMP-LC: 40% total) (LOP-HC: 40% total).",2007,0,0,

Ceballos", Odontology," To compare the 1-year clinical performance of lithium disilicate and resin composite CAD/CAM onlay restorations. Twenty patients that required two restorations in posterior teeth, with at least one cusp to be covered, received two onlays. One was made with IPS e.max CAD (Ivoclar-Vivadent) and the other with Lava Ultimate (3M Oral Care). Two blind observers evaluated the restorations at baseline and 1 year after the onlays were cemented, according to FDI criteria. At each recall, digital photographs, bite-wing radiographs and impressions of the restorations were taken for SEM evaluation of the interface. Results were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05). At baseline and in the 1-year recall, both CAD/CAM materials exhibited excellent results in most criteria with similar esthetic, functional and biological properties (p > 0.05). However, deterioration in surface lustre (p = 0.020) and color match/translucency (p = 0.039) were detected for IPS e.max CAD onlays after 1-year. Under SEM evaluation, there were no statistically differences in micromorphological criteria at baseline nor after a year between IPS e.max CAD and Lava Ultimate onlays.

Patient and operator satisfaction levels were assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) after restoration placement. A total of 37 patients and 47 restorations were included for further study. Four teeth were extracted-three due to extensive drug-induced secondary caries in the same patient, and one tooth due to large periapical periodontitis after 44 months of service. The overall survival rate was 91.4%, and success rate was 87.2%. Differences between baseline and endpoint scores were significant for marginal discoloration (p < 0.05) and adaptation (p < 0.001). Color match (p < 0.05) and surface texture (p < 0.001) differed significantly, affecting all restoration types. VAS scores for patient and operator satisfaction showed a significant rank correlation (p < 0.01), and pairwise comparison showed significant differences for mean overall patient and operator VAS scores (p < 0.001).

The pulp chamber was filled with: group 1 (control), hybrid resin composite (G-aenial Posterior, GC); group 2, as group 1 but covered by 3 meshes of E-glass fibres (EverStick NET, Stick Tech); group 3, FRC resin (EverX Posterior, GC); group 4, as group 3 but covered by 3 meshes of E-glass fibres. The crowns of all teeth were restored with CAD/CAM composite resin endocrowns (LAVA Ultimate, 3M). All specimens were thermo-mechanically loaded in a computer-controlled chewing machine (600,000 cycles, 1.6 Hz, 49 N and simultaneously 1500 thermo-cycles, 60 s, 5-55 °C). Marginal analysis before and after the loading was carried out on epoxy replicas by SEM at 200× magnification. For all the groups, the percentage values of perfect marginal adaptation after loading were always significantly lower than before loading (p < 0.05). The marginal adaptation before and after loading was not significantly different between the experimental groups (p > 0.05). Within the limitations of this in vitro study, the use of FRCs to reinforce the pulp chamber of devitalized molars restored with CAD/CAM composite resin restorations did not significantly influenced their marginal quality.",2016,0,1,
464, Stain susceptibility of composite and ceramic CAD/CAM blocks versus direct resin composites with different resinous matrices,"A. Alharbi, S. Ardu, T. Bortolotto and I. Krejci", Odontology," To evaluate the stain susceptibility of CAD/CAM blocks and direct composite after long term exposure to various staining agents. 40 disk-shaped samples were fabricated from each of nine materials; six CAD/CAM (Vitablocs Mark II, Paradigm MZ100, Experimental Vita Hybrid Ceramic, Vita Enamic, Experimental Kerr and Lava Ultimate) and three direct composites (Filtek Supreme, Venus Diamond and Filtek Silorane). Samples were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8) according to different staining solutions (distilled water, tea, red wine, coffee and artificial saliva). Initial L*a*b* values were assessed using a calibrated digital spectrophotometer. Specimens were immersed in staining solutions and stored in an incubator at 37 °C for 120 days. L*a*b* values were assessed again and color change (∆E) was calculated as difference between recorded L*a*b* values. ANOVA, and Duncan test were used to identify differences between groups (α = 0.05). Significant differences in ∆E values were detected between materials (p = 0.000). Among all staining solutions, the highest ∆E value was observed with red wine. The new CAD/CAM blocks (Vita Enamic, Vita Hybrid Ceramic and Lava Ultimate) showed the highest resistance to staining compared to the MZ100 composite resin blocks. Filtek Silorane, a direct composite, showed high stain resistance values compared to CAD/CAM materials and other direct composites. Ceramic and composite CAD/CAM blocks had lower staining susceptibility than methacrylate based direct composite. Staining susceptibility of the new resin based CAD/CAM materials Vita Enamic and Lava Ultimate was comparable to feldspathic ceramic blocks (Vitablocs Mark II). Filtek Silorane showed promising results that were comparable to some CAD/CAM blocks.",2017,1,1,
127, Effect of Curing Mode on Shear Bond Strength of Self-Adhesive Cement to Composite Blocks,"J. Y. Kim, G. Y. Cho, B. D. Roh and Y. Shin", Materials (Basel)," To overcome the disadvantages of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processed indirect restorations using glass-ceramics and other ceramics, resin nano ceramic, which has high strength and wear resistance with improved polish retention and optical properties, was introduced. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the shear bond strength and fracture pattern of indirect CAD/CAM composite blocks cemented with two self-etch adhesive cements with different curing modes. Sand-blasted CAD/CAM composite blocks were cemented using conventional resin cement, Rely X Ultimate Clicker (RXC, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) with Single Bond Universal (SB, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) for the control group or two self-adhesive resin cements: Rely X U200 (RXU, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) and G-CEM Cerasmart (GC, GC corporation, Tokyo, Japan). RXU and GC groups included different curing modes (light-curing (L) and auto-curing (A)). Shear bond strength (SBS) analyses were performed on all the specimens. The RXC group revealed the highest SBS and the GC A group revealed the lowest SBS. According to Tukey's post hoc test, the RXC group showed a significant difference compared to the GC A group (p < 0.05). For the curing mode, RXU A and RXU L did not show any significant difference between groups and GC A and GC L did not show any significant difference either. Most of the groups except RXC and RXU L revealed adhesive failure patterns predominantly. The RXC group showed a predominant cohesive failure pattern in their CAD/CAM composite, Lava(TM) Ultimate (LU, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA). Within the limitations of this study, no significant difference was found regarding curing modes but more mixed fracture patterns were showed when using the light-curing mode than when using the self-curing mode.",2016,1,1,
233," Fractography of clinically fractured, implant-supported dental computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing crowns","U. Lohbauer, R. Belli, M. S. Cune and U. Schepke", SAGE Open Med Case Rep," Today, a substantial part of the dental crown production uses computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. A recent step in restorative dentistry is the replacement of natural tooth structure with pre-polymerized and machined resin-based methacrylic polymers. Recently, a new CAD/CAM composite was launched for the crown indication in the load-bearing area, but the clinical reality forced the manufacturer to withdraw this specific indication. In parallel, a randomized clinical trial of CAD/CAM composite crowns luted on zirconia implant abutments revealed a high incidence of failure within the first year of service. Fractured crowns of this clinical trial were retrieved and submitted to a fractographic examination. The aim of the case series presented in this article was to identify failure reasons for a new type of CAD/CAM composite crown material (Lava Ultimate; 3M Oral Care, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA) via fractographic examinations and analytical assessment of luting surfaces and water absorption behavior. As a result, the debonding of the composite crowns from the zirconia implant abutments was identified as the central reason for failure. The adhesive interface was found the weakest link. A lack of silica at the zirconia surface certainly has compromised the bonding potential of the adhesive system from the beginning. Additionally, the hydrolytic stress released from swelling of the resin-based crown (water absorption) and transfer to the luting interface further added to the interfacial stress and most probably contributed to a great extend to the debonding failure.",2017,0,1,
393, Multichromatic and highly translucent hybrid ceramic Vita Enamic,H. Steinbrenner, Int J Comput Dent," Vita Enamic is a durable hybrid ceramic that can be processed with efficient computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) support. The porous sintered feldspar ceramic block that is infiltrated with polymer does not require a ceramic furnace after being ground out. Instead, it only needs to be finished and polished. This makes one-time chairside treatment possible. In addition to the well-known monochromatic Vita Enamic blocks, a multichromatic version with integrated shade gradient and a super-translucent version have been developed. The goal of this application study is to demonstrate these new indications with their material benefits in the anterior and posterior regions using four different case studies.",2018,1,0,
446, Seismogenic lavas and explosive eruption forecasting,"Y. Lavallée, P. G. Meredith, D. B. Dingwell, K. U. Hess, J. Wassermann, B. Cordonnier, A. Gerik and J. H. Kruhl", Nature," Volcanic dome-building episodes commonly exhibit acceleration in both effusive discharge rate and seismicity before explosive eruptions. This should enable the application of material failure forecasting methods to eruption forecasting. To date, such methods have been based exclusively on the seismicity of the country rock. It is clear, however, that the rheology and deformation rate of the lava ultimately dictate eruption style. The highly crystalline lavas involved in these eruptions are pseudoplastic fluids that exhibit a strong component of shear thinning as their deformation accelerates across the ductile to brittle transition. Thus, understanding the nature of the ductile-brittle transition in dome lavas may well hold the key to an accurate description of dome growth and stability. Here we present the results of rheological experiments with continuous microseismic monitoring, which reveal that dome lavas are seismogenic and that the character of the seismicity changes markedly across the ductile-brittle transition until complete brittle failure occurs at high strain rates. We conclude that magma seismicity, combined with failure forecasting methods, could potentially be applied successfully to dome-building eruptions for volcanic forecasting.",2008,0,0,
405, Pacific geomagnetic secular variation,R. R. Doell and A. Cox, Science," We have considered several different types of records of long-period geomagnetic secular variation: direct measurements made in geomagnetic observatories; paleomagnetic measurements on Hawaiian lava flows with accurately known ages in the interval 0 to 200 years; paleomagentic measurements on Hawaiian lava flows with loosely determined ages within the interval 200 to 10,000 years ago; and worldwide paleomagnetic measurements of the average geomagnetic angular dispersion recorded in lava flows that formed during the past 0.7 million years. All these magnetic records indicate that, during this time, the nondipole component of the earth's field was lower in the central Pacific than elsewhere, as it is today. This, in turn, indicates that there is some type of inhomogeneity in the lower mantle which is coupled to the earth's core in such a way as to suppress the generation of the nondipole field beneath the central Pacific. With the present incomplete state of knowledge about the processes that give rise to the earth's field, it is uncertain whether undulations in the core-mantle interface or lateral variations in the composition and physical state of the lower mantle are ultimately responsible for the pattern of secular variation seen at the earth's surface.",1971,0,0,
