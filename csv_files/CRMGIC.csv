Meanwhile, many new clinical trials on resin composites had been published. New materials such as bulk fill resin composites and new glass-ionomer (GIC) based materials had been introduced. The focus of this review was to evaluate the longevity in relation to the material class and adhesive class, while adjusting for a possible study bias effect. Material and methods The database PUBMED/SCOPUS were searched for clinical trials on posterior resin composites. The inclusion criteria were: (1) studies published between 2000 and 2019, (2) prospective clinical trial with at least 2 years of observation; (2) minimal number of restorations at last recall = 20; (3) report on drop-out rate; (4) report of operative technique and used materials; (5) utilisation of Ryge, modified Ryge or FDI evaluation criteria. The bias of each study was assessed by two independent reviewers using Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. For the statistical analysis, linear mixed models fitted on the individual data recorded along time have been used with random effects to account for study, patients and experiment effects. P-values smaller than 0.05 were considered significant. Results Of the 423 clinical trials, 62 studies (including 110 experiments) met the inclusion criteria. Material class was divided according to the composite filler in microhybrid (39 experiments/2807 restorations), nanohybrid (24 experiments/1254 restorations), and hybrid (22 experiments/1255 restorations). So-called bulk fill materials were treated as a separate category (9 experiments/506 restorations) as were the GIC (11 experiments/2121 restorations) and the compomer materials (5 experiments/238 restorations). Only one study (1.6%) had low risk of bias, 42 (67.7%) were assessed to have unclear risk of bias and 19 (30.6%) had a high risk of bias. In 52.3% of the studies Class II and Class I restorations had been placed. After 10 years, the survival rate for resin composite restorations dropped to about 85–90% with no significant difference between hybrid, microhybrid and nao-hybrid resin materials. The main reasons for restoration replacement were bulk fractures and wear, which accounted for a about 70% of replacements. Caries at the restorative margins accounted for about 20% of the replacements, and retention loss, inacceptable colour match or marginal integrity, endodontic treatment or cusp fracture for about 10% of the replacements of the resin composite restorations. For compomer and GIC restorations the mean overall survival rate was about 80% after 6 years. For GIC, the main reasons for failure were substantial loss of anatomical contour along with loss of proximal contacts and retention loss. Mainly fractures reduced the longevity of compomers restorations. Also, there was no statistically significant difference between hybrid, micro-hybrid, nano-hybrid and bulk fill resin composites with regard to colour match, surface texture, material fractures, and anatomical form. Conclusions: Posterior resin composite restorations that were placed with the enamel etch technique showed the best overall performance; the longevity was not significantly influenced by the filler type or viscosity of resin composite material. With regard to colour match, surface texture and anatomical form, nanohybrid resins were not significantly superior to hybrid or microhybrid resin composites. Compomer and GIC restorations demonstrated considerable shortcomings and had a significant shorter longevity.","Clinical efficacy, Composite resins, Bulk fill, Compomers, Glass ionomers, Longevity, Meta-analysis, Bias"

Methods Six BF and two non-BF resin-composites were selected. The unset pastes were inserted into white acetal molds (5mm id) with (n=6) depths (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6mm). Three light curing units (LCUs) of increasing radiant emittance capability: 1200, 2000 and 3200mW/cm2 were used. Composite specimen groups (n=3, per depth, per LCU) were irradiated on the upper surface only. For each specific composite, the irradiation times for each LCU were reduced reciprocally, as the LCU irradiance increased, to deliver a constant energy density (J/cm2) to that composite. However, the required energy density for a given composite differed in accordance with each composite manufacturer recommendations. After storing for 24h at 37°C, light transmission measurements were made through each specimen and re-expressed as Apparent Absorbance (A′). Vickers hardness (HV) measurements (n=10) were made on both top and bottom surfaces, for each specimen, and HV versus “depth” profile plots created. From the top-surface data, a Depth-of-Cure parameter could be derived. Data were statistically evaluated for differences between top and bottom HV values and for other predefined variables of interest. Results Irradiation with the LCU of 1200mW/cm2 generally gave the highest HV/depth for most materials tested compared to the other curing lights with higher power output, regardless of top and bottom measurements (p<0.001). However, this difference was material-dependent. With one BF composite, 1200 and 2000mW/cm2 irradiance did not show a significant difference between top and bottom HV. Composites with higher translucency showed reduced differences in top/bottom HV than more opaque composites. Significance Reciprocity was found to be limited with most materials examined, such that irradiance periods of 10s, gave generally better HV outcomes than by using LCUs of superior radiant emittance while reciprocally reducing irradiance time to maintain constant dose of energy density.","Bulk fill, Resin composite, Irradiation regimes, Exposure duration, Reciprocity, Vickers hardness, Hardness depth profile"

The objective of this study was to quantify the long-term elution of various compounds from resin-based dental composites during one year. Methods Eight materials were investigated: G-aenial Anterior, G-aenial Posterior, Venus, Venus Pearl, Venus Diamond, Ceram X mono, Dyract and Filtek Supreme XTE. Cylindrical specimens (6 mm diameter, 2 mm thickness) were immersed in 1mL of three different extraction solutions (water, artificial saliva or ethanol) and stored in the dark at 37°C. Every week, the extraction solution was refreshed. The samples were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results BisEMA3, BisEMA6, BisEMA10, BisGMA, CQ, HEMA, TCD-DI-HEA, TEGDMA, and UDMA were quantified in the samples. Depending on the composite and the extraction solution, certain monomers (BisGMA, HEMA and UDMA) were able to continuously elute from the materials, up until 52 weeks after initial immersion. Monomer elution was clearly higher when ethanol was used as extraction solution. It could be demonstrated that the tested composites continued to release small quantities of monomers over longer periods when a continuous refreshing protocol is followed. Significance Even if monomer elution may not lead to a risk at short term, the potential long-term toxicity should be further investigated. Long-term elution and subsequent chronic exposure to monomers from resin-based dental materials should not be neglected when assessing the overall human health risks.","Artificial saliva, Dental materials, Ethanol, , Liquid chromatography, Mass spectrometry, Monomers"

Methods Totally 78 pairs Class II and 4 pairs Class I restorations were placed in 29 female and 38 male participants with a mean age of 58.3 years (range 37–86). Each patient received at random at least one pair of, as similar as possible, Class II or Class I restorations. In the first cavity of each pair, the modified flowable RMGIC (ACTIVA Bioactive; AB) was placed after phosphoric acid etching of the cavity and without adhesive, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In the other cavity a well established nanofilled resin composite (CeramX; RC) with a single step self-etch adhesive (Xeno Select) was placed. The restorations were evaluated using slightly modified USPHS criteria at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Caries risk and parafunctional habits of the participants were estimated. Results 158 restorations, 8 Class I and 150 Class II, were evaluated at the one year recalls. At baseline two failed restorations were observed (2AB), at 6 months six failures (5AB, 1RC) and at 12 months another thirteen failed restorations were observed (12AB, 1RC). This resulted in annual failure rates of 24.1% for the AB and 2.5% for RC (p<0.0001). The main reasons for failure for AB were lost restorations (5), postoperative symptoms (4) and secondary caries (3). Do to the unacceptable very high one-year failure frequency, the clinical study was stopped and no further evaluation will be performed. Significance The use of the AB restorative in Class II cavities, applied as instructed by the manufacturer after a short phosphoric acid pretreatment but without adhesive system, resulted in a non-acceptable very high failure frequency after a one year period. Further studies should be conducted using a bonding agent","Bioactive, Clinical, Composite resin, Glass ionomer, Posterior, Self etch adhesive"
