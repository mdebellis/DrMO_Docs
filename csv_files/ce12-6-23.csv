CD008426.PUB2,"Nankervis, H; Pynn, EV; Boyle, RJ; Rushton, L; Williams, HC; Hewson, DM; Platts‐Mills, T",House dust mite reduction and avoidance measures for treating eczema,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2015,"Abstract - Background Eczema is an inflammatory skin disease that tends to involve skin creases, such as the folds of the elbows or knees; it is an intensely itchy skin condition, which can relapse and remit over time. As many as a third of people with eczema who have a positive test for allergy to house dust mite have reported worsening of eczema or respiratory symptoms when exposed to dust. Objectives To assess the effects of all house dust mite reduction and avoidance measures for the treatment of eczema. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 14 August 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library  (2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the GREAT database. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant studies. We handsearched abstracts from international eczema and allergy meetings. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any of the house dust mite reduction and avoidance measures for the treatment of eczema, which included participants of any age diagnosed by a clinician with eczema as defined by the World Allergy Organization. We included all non‐pharmacological and pharmacological interventions that sought to reduce or avoid exposure to house dust mite and their allergenic faeces. The comparators were any active treatment, no treatment, placebo, or standard care only. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently checked the titles and abstracts identified, and there were no disagreements. We contacted authors of included studies for additional information. We assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane methodology. Main results We included seven studies of 324 adults and children with eczema. Overall, the included studies had a high risk of bias. Four of the seven trials tested interventions with multiple components, and three tested a single intervention. Two of the seven trials included only children, four included children and adults, and one included only adults. Interventions to reduce or avoid exposure to house dust mite included covers for mattresses and bedding, increased or high‐quality vacuuming of carpets and mattresses, and sprays that kill house dust mites. Four studies assessed our first primary outcome of 'Clinician‐assessed eczema severity using a named scale'. Of these, one study (n = 20) did not show any significant short‐term benefit from allergen impermeable polyurethane mattress encasings and acaricide spray versus allergen permeable cotton mattress encasings and placebo acaricide spray. One study (n = 60) found a modest statistically significant benefit in the Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis (SASSAD) scale over six months (mean difference of 4.2 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 6.7), P = 0.008) in favour of a mite impermeable bedding system combined with benzyltannate spray and high‐filtration vacuuming versus mite permeable cotton encasings, water with a trace of alcohol spray, and a low‐filtration vacuum cleaner. The third study (n = 41) did not compare the change in severity of eczema between the two treatment groups. The fourth study (n = 86) reported no evidence of a difference between the treatment groups. With regard to the secondary outcomes 'Participant‐ or caregiver‐assessed global eczema severity score' and the 'Amount and frequency of topical treatment required', one study (n = 20) assessed these outcomes with similar results being reported for these outcomes in both groups. Four studies (n = 159) assessed 'Sensitivity to house dust mite allergen using a marker'; there was no clear evidence of a difference in sensitivity levels reported between treatments in any of the four trials. None of the seven included studies assessed our second primary outcome 'Participant‐ or caregiver‐assessed eczema‐related quality of life using a named instrument' or the secondary outcome of 'Adverse effects'. We were unable to combine any of our results because of variability in the interventions and paucity of data. Authors' conclusions We were unable to determine clear implications to inform clinical practice from the very low‐quality evidence currently available. The modest treatment responses reported were in people with atopic eczema, specifically with sensitivity to one or more aeroallergens. Thus, their use in the eczema population as a whole is unknown. High‐quality long‐term trials of single, easy‐to‐administer house dust mite reduction or avoidance measures are worth pursuing. Plain language summary House dust mite reduction and avoidance measures for treating eczema Background Eczema is an intensely itchy skin disease that tends to involve skin creases, such as the folds of the elbows or knees. It is a worldwide problem affecting 5% to 20% of children. Around 2% of adults have the condition, and many have a more chronic and severe form. As many as a third of people with eczema who have a positive test for allergy to house dust mite have reported worsening of eczema or respiratory symptoms when exposed to dust. Ways to reduce or avoid exposure to house dust mite, such as covers for mattresses and bedding, increased or high‐quality vacuuming of carpets and mattresses, or sprays that kill the mites, could lessen the severity of eczema for those who are sensitive to house dust mite. In this review, we aimed to assess the effects of all house dust mite reduction and avoidance measures for the treatment of eczema. Review question Do house dust reduction and avoidance measures provide a successful way to treat eczema? Study characteristics We found seven randomised controlled trials, which included 324 adults and children with eczema. We conducted the search up to 14 August 2014. Two of the seven trials included only children; four included children and adults; and one only included adults. Four of the seven trials compared treatments made up of multiple different house dust mite reduction and avoidance measures, and three trials tested a single treatment. The treatments were compared against other house dust mite reduction or avoidance treatments, no treatment, a placebo intervention (e.g., cotton bed covers), or standard care only. Key results We did not find any evidence to inform clinical practice. Some small treatment responses reported were in people with atopic eczema who were sensitive to one or more airborne allergens. We found no evidence of benefit in the other six included studies. Therefore, their use in the eczema population as a whole is unknown. High‐quality longer trials of single, easy‐to‐use house dust mite reduction or avoidance measures should be performed. Quality of the evidence These seven very low‐quality (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach) small trials do not provide enough evidence to recommend any of the house dust mite reduction and avoidance measures tested.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Pyroglyphidae [drug effects]; Acaricides; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Bedding and Linens; Child; Child, Preschool; Dust [*prevention & control]; Eczema [etiology, *prevention & control]; Elbow; Environmental Exposure [*prevention & control]; Household Work [*methods]; Humans; Knee; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Hypersensitivity [etiology, prevention & control]; Young Adult",10.1002/14651858.CD008426.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008426.pub2,Skin

However, blood transfusions have adverse events, some of them potentially related to immune modulation or to a direct transmission of infectious agents (e.g. cytomegalovirus). Leukoreduction is a process in which the white blood cells are intentionally reduced in packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in order to reduce the risk of adverse reactions. The potential benefits of leukoreduced PRBCs in all types of transfused patients for decreasing infectious and non‐infectious complications remain unclear. Objectives To determine the clinical effectiveness of leukoreduction of packed red blood cells for preventing adverse reactions following allogeneic blood transfusion. Search methods We ran the most recent search on 10th November 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase(OvidSP), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), LILACS (BIREME), and clinical trials registers. In addition, we checked the reference lists of all relevant trials and reviews identified in the literature searches. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials including patients of all ages requiring PRBC allogeneic transfusion. Any study was eligible for inclusion, regardless of the length of participant follow‐up or country where the study was performed. The primary outcome was transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI). Secondary outcomes were death from any cause, infection from any cause, non‐infectious complications and any other adverse event. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessments and data extraction. We estimated pooled relative risk for dichotomous outcomes, and we measured statistical heterogeneity using I² statistic. The random‐effects model was used to synthesise results. We conducted a trial sequential analysis to assess the risk of random errors in cumulative meta‐analyses. Main results Thirteen studies, most including adult patients, met the eligibility criteria. We found no clear evidence of an effect of leukoreduced PRBC versus non‐leukoreduced PRBC in patients that were randomised to receive transfusion for the following outcomes: TRALI : RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.36, P = 0.80 from one trial reporting data on 1864 trauma patients. The accrued information of 1864 participants constituted only 28.5% of the diversity‐adjusted required information size (DARIS) of 6548 participants. The quality of evidence was low.  Death from any cause:  RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.12, I² statistic = 63%, P = 0.20 from nine trials reporting data on 6485 cardiovascular surgical patients, gastro‐oncology surgical patients, trauma patients and HIV infected patients. The accrued information of 6485 participants constituted only 55.3% of the DARIS of 11,735 participants. The quality of evidence was very low.  Infection from any cause:  RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.03, I² statistic = 84%, P = 0.08 from 10 trials reporting data on 6709 cardiovascular surgical patients, gastro‐oncology surgical patients, trauma patients and HIV infected patients. The accrued information of 6709 participants constituted only 60.6% of the DARIS of 11,062 participants. The quality of evidence was very low.  Adverse events:  The only adverse event reported as an adverse event was fever (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.02; I² statistic= 0%, P = 0.07). Fever was reported in two trials on 634 cardiovascular surgical and gastro‐oncology surgical patients. The accrued information of 634 participants constituted only 84.4% of the DARIS of 751 participants. The quality of evidence was low.  Incidence of other non‐infectious complications:  This outcome was not assessed in any included trial. Authors' conclusions There is no clear evidence for supporting or rejecting the routine use of leukoreduction in all patients requiring PRBC transfusion for preventing TRALI, death, infection, non‐infectious complications and other adverse events. As the quality of evidence is very low to low, more evidence is needed before a definitive conclusion can be drawn. Plain language summary White blood cells reduction in packed red blood cell transfusions for preventing adverse reactions Background   A blood transfusion is when blood is taken from one person and given to another person. Blood transfusions are given to solve life and health‐threatening medical conditions on a short‐term basis. However, blood transfusions have adverse events, some of them potentially related to an immune system response or due to the transmission of infectious agents (e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus). Leukoreduction is a process in which the white blood cells are intentionally removed from donated blood in order to reduce the risk of adverse reactions in people receiving the blood transfusion. The benefits of removing white blood cells with the intent of reducing infectious and non‐infectious complications in all types of transfused patients remains unclear. Removing white blood cells is costly. The USA and UK spend tens of millions each year on the procedure. In the USA, the procedure costs approximately USD $30 for each unit of blood product. It may not be worth spending so much money if there is no clear benefit to patients. Clinical question   What are the benefits and harms of removing white blood cells from donated blood for people receiving a blood transfusion? Study characteristics   We searched medical journals for reports of clinical trials which examined the effects of removing white blood cells from donated blood. We were interested in finding out whether the removal of white blood cells from donated blood resulted in patients receiving a blood transfusion having few complications such as transfusion‐related acute lung injury, death, infectious and non‐infectious complications, or any other adverse event. We included people of any age or sex, who received a blood transfusion for any reason. The evidence is based on studies retrieved up to 05 December 2014. Main results   We found 13 studies which included people who received a blood transfusion during heart or cancer surgery, or because they were injured, had cancer, HIV or sepsis. We found no clear evidence showing either benefits or harms for removing white blood cells from donated blood. For all of the outcomes examined (transfusion‐related acute lung injury, death from any cause, infection from any cause, non‐infectious complication or any other adverse event), there was no sign of benefit or harm. Quality of evidence   The overall quality of evidence of the included studies ranges from very low to low. None of the studies included enough people to give a definitive answer about the usefulness of removing white blood cells from donated blood. New high‐quality studies, involving a few thousand people, are needed to enable us to know the true benefits and harms of this procedure.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Leukocyte Reduction Procedures; Adolescent; Adult; Cause of Death; Erythrocyte Transfusion [*adverse effects]; Female; Humans; Infections [etiology]; Male; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,10.1002/14651858.CD009745.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009745.pub2,Injuries
CD002989,"Kilburn, SA; Lasserson, TJ; McKean, MC",Pet allergen control measures for allergic asthma in children and adults,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2001,"Abstract - Background Although pet removal has been recommended in guidelines on the management of allergic asthma, pet ownership remains high in families where one or more members have an allergy to pet dander. Allergen control measures such as air filtration units placed in the homes of pet‐allergic asthmatics have been used as a means of reducing allergen exposure. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy of pet allergen control measures in the homes of people with pet‐allergic asthma. Search methods We carried out an electronic search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials. No restriction was placed on language of publication. Searches are current as of September 2008. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing an active allergen reduction measure with control were considered for analysis. Participants had stable pet‐allergic asthma. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers extracted data independently. Only a limited amount of data could be analysed and no meta‐analysis was possible. Main results Two studies met the inclusion criteria for the analysis. Both examined the effectiveness of air filtration units. Both trials were small (n = 22 and n = 35). No significant differences were detected between active intervention and control on the primary and secondary outcome measures reported in the studies. Data on absence from school or work were not reported in either study. No meta‐analysis could be performed due to lack of common outcomes. An update search conducted in September 2006 did not identify any further trials. Authors' conclusions The available trials are too small to provide evidence for or against the use of air filtration units to reduce allergen levels in the management of pet‐allergic asthma. Adequately powered trials are needed. There are no trials of other allergen reduction measures, such as pet washing or possibly pet removal. Plain language summary Pet allergen control measures for allergic asthma in children and adults Some people with asthma who own pets can be allergic to the dander that accumulates in and around the home. Certain guidelines recommend the removal of pets as the most effective way of reducing exposure to the allergens emanating from their hair and skin. Other measures have been proposed as an alternative to pet removal, such as pet washing, sprays and air filtration units. The aim of these interventions is to lower the amount of allergen in the air and on the floor of the home, and so limit the risk of asthma symptoms worsening. Very little research of a high quality has been published on this topic, and the current evidence is not sufficiently reliable to draw firm conclusions. Further research should consider the effectiveness of pet washing, sprays and possibly pet removal from the home.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Animals, Domestic; *Housing; Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Allergens [*isolation & purification]; Animals; Asthma [*prevention & control]; Child; Environment, Controlled; Filtration; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD002989,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002989,Airways

The apparent rise in food anaphylaxis in young children over the past three decades is of particular concern, owing to the lack of proven prevention strategies other than the timely introduction of peanut and egg. Due to reported in vitro differences in the immune response of young infants primed with whole‐cell pertussis (wP) versus acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine, we systematically appraised and synthesised evidence on the safety and the potential allergy preventive benefits of wP, to inform recommendation for future practice and research. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of wP vaccinations in comparison to aP vaccinations in early infancy for the prevention of atopic diseases in children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and grey literature. The date of the search was 7 September 2020. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) that reported the occurrence of atopic diseases, and RCTs only to assess safety outcomes. To be included studies had to have at least six months follow‐up, and involve children under 18 years old, who received a first dose of either wP (experimental intervention) or aP (comparator) before six months of age. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were diagnosis of IgE‐mediated food allergy and all‐cause serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes included: diagnosis of not vaccine‐associated anaphylaxis or urticaria, diagnosis of asthma, diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and diagnosis of encephalopathy. Due to paucity of RCTs reporting on the atopic outcomes of interest, we assessed a broader outcome domain (cumulative incidence of atopic disease) as specified in our protocol. We summarised effect estimates as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we pooled safety data in meta‐analyses using fixed‐effect Mantel‐Haenszel methods, without zero‐cell corrections for dichotomous outcomes. Main results We identified four eligible studies reporting on atopic outcomes, representing 7333 children. Based on a single trial, there was uncertain evidence on whether wP vaccines affected the risk of overall atopic disease (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17) or asthma only (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.82; 497 children) by 2.5 years old.Three NRSIs were judged to be at serious or critical risk of bias due to confounding, missing data, or both, and were ineligible for inclusion in a narrative synthesis.  We identified 21 eligible studies (137,281 children) that reported the safety outcomes of interest. We judged seven studies to be at high risk of bias and those remaining, at unclear risk.  The pooled RR was 0.94 for all‐cause SAEs (95% CI 0.78 to 1.15; I 2  = 0%; 15 studies, 38,072 children). For every 1000 children primed with a first dose of wP, 11 had an SAE. The corresponding risk with aP was 12 children (95% CI 9 to 13). The 95% CI around the risk difference ranged from three fewer to two more events per 1000 children, and the certainty of the evidence was judged as moderate (downgraded one level for imprecision). No diagnoses of encephalopathy following vaccination were reported (95% CI around the risk difference ‐ 5 to 12 per 100,000 children; seven primary series studies; 115,271 children). The certainty of the evidence was judged as low, since this is a serious condition, and we could not exclude a clinically meaningful difference. Authors' conclusions There is very low‐certainty evidence that a first dose of wP given early in infancy, compared to a first dose of aP, affects the risk of atopic diseases in children. The incidence of all‐cause SAEs in wP and aP vaccinees was low, and no cases of encephalopathy were reported. The certainty of the evidence was judged as moderate for all‐cause SAEs, and low for encephalopathy. Future studies should use sensitive and specific endpoints of clinical relevance, and should be conducted in settings with high prevalence of IgE‐mediated food allergy. Safety endpoints should prioritise common vaccine reactions, parental acceptability, SAEs and their potential relatedness to the dose administered. Plain language summary Can a first dose of whole‐cell whooping cough vaccine given before six months old prevent allergic diseases in childhood? What are allergic diseases? Allergic diseases are among the most common persistent illnesses in children. They are caused by the immune system reacting abnormally to otherwise harmless substances such as foods and pollens. Food allergies are of increasing concern as the number of cases reported in a number of high‐income countries over the past 30 years appears to have increased. Why we did this Cochrane Review? The only proven preventive strategy against food allergies is early introduction of peanut and egg into the infant diet. However, a recent study found that food allergies appeared less common in children who had received one or more doses of whole‐cell (wP) whooping cough vaccine in early infancy than in those who had received acellular (aP) whooping cough vaccines only. That study could not determine whether the apparently lower risk of allergy was because of the wP vaccine, or whether it was because of other potential differences between wP and aP‐vaccinated children, as the vaccines were not randomly assigned. Therefore, a Cochrane Review was required to identify any evidence of wP as a food allergy prevention strategy. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared wP versus aP vaccination in babies younger than six months. We were interested in comparing babies vaccinated with wP vaccines and those vaccinated with aP vaccines, with respect to: 1. how many went on to develop food allergy, asthma or serious (and potentially life‐threatening) allergic reactions; 2. how many had serious unwanted events following vaccination; and, 3. how many had encephalopathy, a serious yet uncommon condition affecting the brain. To compare rates of encephalopathy and other serious unwanted events, we looked for studies in which babies were given wP or aP vaccines at random (randomised controlled trials (RCTs)). To compare rates of allergic diseases, we also looked for studies where wP or aP vaccines were not given at random (non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs)). In either case, studies lasted for at least six months. Search date We included evidence published up to September 2020. What we found Investigation 1 We found four studies (7333 children) carried out in Sweden (one), Australia (two) and the UK (one) that looked at the effect of whooping cough vaccines on allergic diseases. As we found little reliable data about the risk of food allergy after whooping cough vaccine, we decided to look at the risk of any allergic disease. Within 2.5 years of receiving a whooping cough vaccine (one RCT), 37/137 children vaccinated with wP, and 114/360 vaccinated with aP were diagnosed with at least one allergic disease. During the same period 15/137 vaccinated with wP and 38/360 vaccinated with aP were diagnosed with asthma specifically. No studies assessed serious or potentially life‐threatening allergic reactions. Investigations 2 & 3 Low numbers of serious unwanted effects were reported for all groups (15 studies, 38,072 children). For every 1000 babies vaccinated with a first dose of wP, 11 had at least one serious unwanted effect. The risk for those who received aP vaccines was 12 children. No cases of encephalopathy were identified in either group (seven studies, 115,271 children). How reliable are these findings? One RCT reporting on whooping cough vaccines and allergic diseases included few children, and was carried out in a country with low levels of allergic disease. Therefore, it remains very uncertain whether a first dose of wP does or does not decrease the risk of allergic diseases. Very few children experienced serious unwanted effects. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of serious unwanted effects in children vaccinated with a first dose of wP, compared with aP, but any difference is likely to be small. No cases of encephalopathy following vaccination were reported. Because this is a serious outcome, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low. Key messages Ongoing and future studies may change our conclusions and provide more definitive evidence. The data reviewed suggest that wP is safe and support its continued use in countries where it is still recommended for preventing whooping cough.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Eczema; *Hypersensitivity, Immediate; *Whooping Cough; Adolescent; Bias; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Pertussis Vaccine [adverse effects]",10.1002/14651858.CD013682.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013682.pub2,Tobacco Addiction
CD002204.PUB5,"Francis, NZ; Southern, KW",Antifungal therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2022,"Abstract - Background Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic reaction to colonisation of the lungs with the fungus  Aspergillus fumigatus,  and affects around 10% of people with cystic fibrosis. ABPA is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. High doses of corticosteroids are the main treatment for ABPA; although the long‐term benefits are not clear, and their many side effects are well‐documented. A group of compounds, the azoles, have activity against  A fumigatus , and have been proposed as an alternative treatment for ABPA. Of this group, itraconazole is the most active. A separate antifungal compound, amphotericin B, has been used in aerosolised form to treat invasive infection with  A fumigatus , and may have potential for the treatment of ABPA. Antifungal therapy for ABPA in cystic fibrosis needs to be evaluated. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives The review aimed to test the hypotheses that antifungal interventions for the treatment of ABPA in cystic fibrosis: 1. improve clinical status compared to placebo or standard therapy (no placebo); and 2. do not have unacceptable adverse effects. If benefit was demonstrated, we planned to assess the optimal type, duration, and dose of antifungal therapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register was 28 September 2021. We searched ongoing trials registries, most recently on 11 March 2022. Earlier, we also approached pharmaceutical companies regarding possible unpublished trials. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials, in which antifungal treatments were compared to either placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of the same treatment were used in the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The searches identified six trials; none of which met the inclusion criteria for the review. Main results We included no completed randomised controlled trials. There is currently one ongoing trial, which we may find eligible for a future update. Authors' conclusions At present, there are no randomised controlled trials that evaluate the use of antifungal therapies for the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis, although one trial is currently ongoing. Trials with clear outcome measures are needed to properly evaluate the use of corticosteroids in people with ABPA and cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We planned to review the evidence about the effect of treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in people with cystic fibrosis. Background ABPA is an allergic lung reaction to a type of fungus (usually  Aspergillus fumigatus ) in some people with cystic fibrosis. It causes a cough and wheezing, and sometimes fever. If left untreated, ABPA can lead to long‐term lung damage. It is usually treated with a high dose of corticosteroids (also known as steroids). However, it has not been proven that corticosteroids can prevent lung function from deteriorating in the long term. Also, long‐term use of corticosteroids is linked to some serious side effects. Treating the fungus that causes ABPA may be an alternative to using high doses of corticosteroids to combat the allergic reaction. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 28 September 2021. Study characteristics We did not find any trials that we could include in the review. Key results There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of antifungal treatment in people with cystic fibrosis and ABPA. We need trials to assess the effects of corticosteroids in this population in the long and the short term.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary [complications, drug therapy]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Antifungal Agents [therapeutic use]; Aspergillus fumigatus; Humans; Itraconazole [therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD002204.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002204.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders
CD000460,"Ardern, K",Tartrazine exclusion for allergic asthma,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2001,"Abstract - Background Tartrazine is the best known and one of the most commonly used food additives. Food colorants are also used in many medications as well as foods. There has been conflicting evidence as to whether tartrazine causes exacerbations of asthma with some studies finding a positive association especially in individuals with cross‐sensitivity to aspirin. Objectives To assess the overall effect of tartrazine (exclusion or challenge) in the management of asthma. Search methods A search was carried out on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. Bibliographies of each RCT was searched for additional papers. Authors of identified RCTs were contacted for further information. Searches are updated annually and are current as of February 2006. Selection criteria RCTs of oral administration of tartrazine (as a challenge) versus placebo or dietary avoidance of tartrazine versus normal diet were considered. Studies which focused upon allergic asthma, were also included. Studies of tartrazine exclusion for other allergic conditions such as hay fever, allergic rhinitis and eczema were only considered if the results for subjects with asthma were separately identified. Trials could be in either adults or children with asthma or allergic asthma (e.g. sensitivity to aspirin or food items known to contain tartrazine). Data collection and analysis Study quality was assessed and data abstracted by two reviewers independently. Outcomes were analysed using RevMan 4.1.1. Main results Ninety four abstracts were found, of which 20 were potentially relevant. Six? met the inclusion criteria, but only three presented results in a format that permitted analysis and none could be combined in a meta‐analysis. In none of the studies did tartrazine challenge or avoidance in diet significantly alter asthma outcomes. Authors' conclusions Due to the paucity of available evidence, it is not possible to provide firm conclusions as to the effects of tartrazine on asthma control. However, the six RCTs that could be included in this review all arrived at the same conclusion. Routine tartrazine exclusion may not benefit most patients, except those very few individuals with proven sensitivity.

CD009014.PUB2,"Nurmatov, U; Venderbosch, I; Devereux, G; Simons, FER; Sheikh, A",Allergen‐specific oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2012,"Abstract - Background Peanut allergy is one of the most common forms of food allergy encountered in clinical practice.  In most cases, it does not spontaneously resolve; furthermore, it is frequently implicated in acute life‐threatening reactions. The current management of peanut allergy centres on meticulous avoidance of peanuts and peanut‐containing foods. Allergen‐specific oral immunotherapy (OIT) for peanut allergy aims to induce desensitisation and then tolerance to peanut, and has the potential to revolutionise the management of peanut allergy. However, at present there is still considerable uncertainty about the effectiveness and safety of this approach. Objectives To establish the effectiveness and safety of OIT in people with IgE‐mediated peanut allergy who develop symptoms after peanut ingestion. Search methods We searched in the following databases: AMED, BIOSIS, CAB, CINAHL,  The Cochrane Library , EMBASE, Global Health, Google Scholar, IndMed, ISI Web of Science, LILACS, MEDLINE, PakMediNet and TRIP. We also searched registers of on‐going and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was January 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs or controlled clinical trials involving children or adults with clinical features indicative of IgE‐mediated peanut allergy treated with allergen‐specific OIT, compared with control group receiving either placebo or no treatment, were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently checked and reviewed titles and abstracts of identified studies and assessed risk of bias. The full text of potentially relevant trials was assessed. Data extraction was independently performed by two reviewers with disagreements resolved through discussion. Main results We found one small RCT, judged to be at low risk of bias, that enrolled 28 children aged 1 to 16 years with evidence of sensitisation to peanut and a clinical history of reaction to peanut within 60 minutes of exposure. The study did not include children who had moderate to severe asthma or who had a history of severe peanut anaphylaxis. Randomisation was in a 2:1 ratio resulting in 19 children being randomised to the intervention arm and nine to the placebo arm. Intervention arm children received OIT with peanut flour and control arm participants received placebo comprising of oat flour. The primary outcome was assessed using a double‐blind, placebo controlled oral food challenge (OFC) at approximately one year. No data were available on longer term outcomes beyond the OFC conducted at the end of the study. Because of adverse events, three patients withdrew from the intervention arm before the completion of the study. Therefore, only 16 participants received the full course of peanut OIT, whereas all nine patients receiving placebo completed the trial. The per‐protocol analysis found a significant increase in the threshold dose of peanut allergen required to trigger a reaction in those in the intervention arm with all 16 participants able to ingest the maximum cumulative dose of 5000 mg of peanut protein (which the authors equate as being equivalent to approximately 20 peanuts) without developing symptoms, whereas in the placebo group they were able to ingest a median cumulative dose of 280 mg (range: 0 to 1900 mg, P < 0.001) before experiencing symptoms.    Per‐protocol analyses also demonstrated that peanut OIT resulted in reductions in skin prick test size (P < 0.001), interleukin‐5 (P = 0.01), interleukin‐13 (P = 0.02) and an increase in peanut‐specific immunoglobulin G 4  (IgG 4 ) (P < 0.01). Children in the intervention arm experienced more adverse events during treatment than those in the placebo arm. In the initial day escalation phase, nine (47%) of the 19 participants initially enrolled in the OIT arm experienced clinically‐relevant adverse events which required treatment with H 1 ‐antihistamines, two of which required additional treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline). Authors' conclusions The one small RCT we found showed that allergen‐specific peanut OIT can result in desensitisation in children, and that this is associated with evidence of underlying immune‐modulation. However, this treatment approach was associated with a substantial risk of adverse events, although the majority of these were mild.  In view of the risk of adverse events and the lack of evidence of long��term benefits, allergen‐specific peanut OIT cannot currently be recommended as a treatment for the management of patients with IgE‐mediated peanut allergy.  Larger RCTs are needed to investigate the acceptability, long‐term effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of safer treatment regimens, particularly in relation to the induction of clinical and immunological tolerance. Plain language summary Oral immunotherapy for the treatment of peanut allergy Allergy to peanut can result in potentially life‐threatening reactions and, on occasions, death. Unlike many other forms of food allergy, allergy to peanut is typically life‐long. There is currently no cure for peanut allergy and people with this allergy must constantly be careful to avoid accidentally eating peanut or peanut‐containing foods.  If a person with a peanut allergy accidentally ingests peanut, he or she may develop serious allergic reactions necessitating emergency treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline). The overall goal of allergen‐specific oral immunotherapy (OIT) for peanut allergy is to reduce and, if possible, eliminate the risk of further reactions associated with exposure to peanuts. Most people who have reactions to peanut have an immediate type (also sometimes known as IgE‐mediated) reaction in which symptoms typically develop within minutes of exposure to peanut protein and it is for this group that allergen‐specific OIT is a potential treatment approach.  It is not considered suitable for those who experience more delayed (also sometimes known as non‐IgE mediated) reactions.  Treatment involves giving people with peanut allergy very small doses of peanut protein by mouth and gradually increasing the amount being administered (the build‐up phase). Once the desired dose has been achieved, this is followed by the patient taking the same dose of peanut every day for a set period of time (maintenance phase).  As giving doses of peanut to someone with a peanut allergy has the potential to introduce allergic reactions, participants' safety needs to be carefully monitored during studies of peanut OIT. We found one small trial undertaken in 28 children aged 1 to 16 years with confirmed peanut allergy. The study did not include children who had moderate to severe asthma or who had had severe anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction that may result in death) because of their peanut allergy. The authors randomised children to intervention or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Intervention arm children received peanut flour whereas control arm participants received oat flour. The 48‐week trial showed that treatment with peanut OIT enabled children receiving OIT to substantially increase the amount of peanut flour they ate in comparison with those in the placebo arm without having an allergic reaction.  However, almost half of the children (nine out of 19) receiving OIT had an allergic reaction due to the OIT which required antihistamines, and two had more serious reactions to the treatment which required adrenaline (epinephrine).  Although promising, based on the findings of this one small trial, we cannot recommend that peanut OIT be used routinely for people with peanut allergy. There is a need for further larger studies investigating safer OIT regimens and establishing the long‐term effectiveness of OIT after treatment is stopped.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Arachis [immunology]; Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Allergens [*administration & dosage, immunology]; Child; Child, Preschool; Desensitization, Immunologic [adverse effects, *methods]; Epinephrine [therapeutic use]; Flour; Histamine H1 Antagonists [therapeutic use]; Humans; Infant; Peanut Hypersensitivity [immunology, *therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD009014.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009014.pub2,Tobacco Addiction

Despite improved understanding of the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis and advances in its pharmacological treatment, its prevalence has increased worldwide. For patients whose symptoms remain uncontrolled despite medical treatment, allergen injection immunotherapy is advised. An allergen‐based treatment may reduce symptoms, the need for medication and modify the natural course of this disease. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous specific allergen immunotherapy, compared with placebo, for reducing symptoms and medication requirements in seasonal allergic rhinitis patients. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 1 2006), MEDLINE (1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), Pre‐MEDLINE, KOREAMED, INDMED, LILACS, PAKMEDINET, Scisearch,  m RCT and the National Research Register. The date of the last search was February 2006. Selection criteria All studies identified by the searches were assessed to identify randomised controlled trials involving participants with symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and proven allergen sensitivity, treated with subcutaneous allergen specific immunotherapy or corresponding placebo. Data collection and analysis Two independent authors identified all studies reporting double‐blind, placebo controlled randomised trials of specific immunotherapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to tree, grass or weed pollens. Two authors independently performed quality assessment of studies. Data from identified studies were abstracted onto a standard extraction sheet and subsequently entered into RevMan 4.2.8. Analysis was performed using the Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) method and a random‐effects model; P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The primary outcome measures were symptom scores, medication use, quality of life and adverse events. Main results We retrieved 1111 publications of which 51 satisfied our inclusion criteria. In total there were 2871 participants (1645 active, 1226 placebo), each receiving on average 18 injections. Duration of immunotherapy varied from three days to three years. Symptom score data from 15 trials were suitable for meta‐analysis and showed an overall reduction in the immunotherapy group (SMD ‐0.73 (95% CI ‐0.97 to ‐0.50, P < 0.00001)). Medication score data from 13 trials showed an overall reduction in the immunotherapy group (SMD of ‐0.57 (95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.33, p<0.00001)). Clinical interpretation of the effect size is difficult. Adrenaline was given in 0.13% (19 of 14085 injections) of those on active treatment and in 0.01% (1 of 8278 injections) of the placebo group for treatment of adverse events. There were no fatalities. Authors' conclusions This review has shown that specific allergen injection immunotherapy in suitably selected patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis results in a significant reduction in symptom scores and medication use. Injection immunotherapy has a known and relatively low risk of severe adverse events. We found no long‐term consequences from adverse events. Plain language summary Immunotherapy by allergen injections for seasonal allergic rhinitis ('hay fever') Seasonal allergic rhinitis ('hay fever') is a global health problem and its prevalence has increased considerably in the last two decades. Treatment includes allergen avoidance, drugs such as antihistamine tablets and nasal sprays, and immunotherapy (vaccination). For those patients whose symptoms remain uncontrolled despite drug treatment, specific allergen immunotherapy (SIT) is advised. Specific allergen immunotherapy is most commonly administered as subcutaneous (under the skin) injections by specialists requiring a building‐up period followed by a maintenance period of three to five years. Immunotherapy may also be delivered by the oral, nasal or sublingual route and these will be studied in separate Cochrane reviews, as will immunotherapy for perennial (all year round) allergic rhinitis. In this review we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of injection immunotherapy, compared with placebo, for reducing symptoms and the need for medication. We identified randomised, double‐blind, placebo controlled trials of specific allergen immunotherapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to tree, grass or weed pollens. Fifty‐one studies satisfied our inclusion criteria. In total there were 2871 participants (1645 in the treatment groups and 1226 in the placebo), each receiving on average 18 injections. The duration of treatment varied from three days to three years.

It may be an early sign of necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis or other serious gastrointestinal conditions, or it may result from gut immaturity with delayed passage of meconium. Glycerin laxatives stimulate passage of meconium by acting as an osmotic dehydrating agent and increasing osmotic pressure in the gut; they stimulate rectal contraction, potentially reducing the incidence of feeding intolerance. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of glycerin laxatives (enemas/suppositories) for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We restricted our search to all randomised controlled trials and applied no language restrictions. We searched the references of identified studies and reviews on this topic and handsearched for additional articles. We searched the database maintained by the US National Institutes of Health (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and European trial registries to identify ongoing trials. Selection criteria We considered only randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials that enrolled preterm infants < 32 weeks' gestational age (GA) and/or < 1500 g birth weight. We included trials if they administered glycerin laxatives and measured at least one prespecified clinical outcome. Data collection and analysis We used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Group to assess methodological quality of trials, to collect data and to perform analyses. Main results We identified three trials that evaluated use of prophylactic glycerin laxatives in preterm infants. We identified no trials that evaluated therapeutic use of glycerin laxatives for feeding intolerance. Our review showed that prophylactic administration of glycerin laxatives did not reduce the time required to achieve full enteral feeds and did not influence secondary outcomes, including duration of hospital stay, mortality and weight at discharge. Prophylactic administration of glycerin laxatives resulted in failure of fewer infants to pass stool over the first 48 hours. Included trials reported no adverse events. Authors' conclusions Our review of available evidence for glycerin laxatives does not support the routine use of prophylactic glycerin laxatives in clinical practice. Additional studies are needed to confirm or refute the effectiveness and safety of glycerin laxatives for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in VLBW infants. Plain language summary Glycerin laxatives for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in very low birth weight infants Review question:  Are glycerin laxatives (enemas/suppositories) safe and effective for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants? Background:  Preterm babies are at increased risk of feeding intolerance. Factors that contribute to feeding intolerance are many and include immature motility of the gut and increased viscosity of meconium. Enhancement of passage of the first stool (meconium) might enhance the ability of the preterm infant to tolerate feeds and might help reduce time spent receiving intravenous fluids. Study characteristics:  Our review identified three studies that addressed the use of glycerin suppositories to prevent feeding intolerance in preterm infants. Key findings:  We found that a glycerin enema given to preterm infants prophylactically did not shorten time to full feeding, nor did it decrease time to discharge. However, available data are too limited to allow a strong conclusion. Conclusions:  Our review of available evidence for glycerin laxatives does not support routine prophylactic use of glycerin laxatives in clinical practice. Additional studies are needed to confirm or refute the effectiveness and safety of glycerin laxatives for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in VLBW infants.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Enema [methods]; Enteral Nutrition [*adverse effects]; Gestational Age; Glycerol [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Laxatives [*therapeutic use]; Meconium; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Suppositories",10.1002/14651858.CD010464.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010464.pub2,Neonatal

Itch is the most important aspect of eczema, often impacting significantly on the quality of life of an affected individual. Objectives To assess the effects of oral antihistamines (H1 antagonists) as monotherapy in children and adults with eczema. Search methods We searched the following databases up to March 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library  (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We examined the reference lists of excluded studies in order to identify further references to relevant trials. We searched trials registers for ongoing and unpublished trials. We also handsearched the abstracts of the International Research Workshops on eczema, as well as the conference proceedings of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), from 2000 to 2011. Selection criteria We sought to include randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects and safety of oral H1 antihistamines as monotherapy in children and adults with eczema. We excluded studies that compared an antihistamine versus another antihistamine and had no placebo control arm. We also excluded topical antihistamines and oral H1 antihistamines as 'add‐on' therapy and studies using any concomitant therapy other than emollients or moisturisers, principally because some of these forms of concomitant therapy may be considered treatment modifiers in assessments of the effects of antihistamines on eczema. Data collection and analysis Our search retrieved 409 references to studies. Based on assessments of their titles, abstracts, or both, we excluded all except 36 of these studies. After evaluation of the full text of each report, we excluded a further 35 studies, and 1 study is awaiting classification pending a response from the trial investigators. Two review authors independently carried out study assessment. Main results No randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions There is currently no high‐level evidence to support or refute the efficacy or safety of oral H1 antihistamines used as monotherapy for eczema. Because most of the studies allowed the use of concomitant medications and involved multi‐therapeutic approaches, meaningful assessments of the individual effects of oral H1 antihistamines on eczema were not feasible. Although well‐designed randomised controlled trials excluding concomitant medications appear to be needed, consideration should be given to the potential ethical issues raised with the use of antihistamines as monotherapy for the management of eczema by withholding the use of rescue or additional therapies. A further systematic review of studies in which concomitant therapies were permitted might be of value in determining the potential benefits of oral H1 antihistamines as add‐on therapy. Plain language summary Effects of antihistamines on eczema Eczema is a common chronic disease. Itch is the most important symptom, and eczema is often accompanied by dry skin. Skin lesions include rash, redness, swelling of the skin, crusts, oozing, and sometimes also bleeding as a consequence of persistent scratching. Although the disease can resolve during childhood, it might also recur in or persist into adult life. The cause of eczema is considered to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Moisturisers, topical corticosteroids, and topical immunomodulators are the mainstay during treatment of eczema, while more severe cases might need UV light therapy or systemic immunosuppressants. Itch is very difficult to treat and leads to scratching, which leads to more inflammation of the skin, and often people with eczema end up in a vicious circle of itching and scratching. The role of histamine in itching associated with eczema is not fully elucidated, but oral H1 antihistamines have been used for many years in the treatment of eczema. These might have been used largely for their sedative action, with highly sedative antihistamines, e.g. chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine. However, oral H1 antihistamines are widely used in the treatment of allergic disorders, such as urticaria, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis, but their efficacy in alleviating itch and eczema remains unclear. This systematic review sought evidence for the effects and safety of the use of oral antihistamines for eczema, to guide their use in clinical practice. No study matched our inclusion criteria. There is currently no evidence to support the efficacy or safety of the use of oral H1 antihistamines alone in the treatment of eczema. This does not mean that such antihistamines could not be useful as an add‐on therapy to the main treatments including topical steroids, which will be the topic of a further review.",2,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Eczema [*drug therapy]; Histamine H1 Antagonists [*administration & dosage]; Humans",10.1002/14651858.CD007770.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007770.pub2,Skin

Plain language summary Feather versus non‐feather bedding for asthma An allergen is the substance that causes an allergic reaction in someone who is hypersensitive to it. A major allergen for asthma is the house dust mite. It is thought that artificial (man‐made) fibre fillings for pillows and bedding are less likely to gather allergens than feather‐filled pillows and quilts. However, there is some evidence that in fact, feather bedding may in fact be less likely to cause asthma. The review found no trials comparing feathers with man‐made fibres, and research is needed to be certain which is better for people with asthma.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Bedding and Linens; Asthma [*prevention & control]; Child; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,10.1002/14651858.CD002154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002154,Airways

The date of the most recent search was 21 September 2009. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children under the age of 18 with a history of allergic rhinitis, with or without allergic conjunctivitis or asthma, comparing topical nasal steroids with antihistamines to topical nasal steroids only. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Main results One study including 24 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. This study compared the administration of topical nasal steroids with oral antihistamines to topical nasal steroids only in children, but it did not provide sufficient data to address the clinical question of this review. Authors' conclusions In view of the lack of evidence for the benefit or lack of benefit of antihistamine add‐on therapy with topical nasal steroids for children with intermittent or persistent allergic rhinitis, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the adverse effects of antihistamines and the additional costs that may be incurred. Plain language summary Antihistamines as an addition to topical nasal steroids for allergic rhinitis in children Allergic rhinitis is a very common chronic illness affecting 10% to 40% of children worldwide. Seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is most common around springtime. The symptoms are mostly sneezing, a runny nose and watery eyes. We looked for trials that compared antihistamines (either oral or topical) in addition to a topical nasal steroid with a topical nasal steroid alone in children who had allergic rhinitis. We wanted to know whether adding antihistamines (oral or topical) in the therapy of children with allergic rhinitis who already use topical nasal steroids would have additional benefits for them. We found one trial that had been carried out in children comparing oral antihistamines in addition to topical nasal steroids with topical nasal steroids alone but it did not provide sufficient data to draw any conclusions. Most of the trials focused only on adults or included a small number of children. Unfortunately, the trials which included children along with adults did not report whether there were any differences in the effect of treatment or adverse effects in children in comparison with adults. We are therefore unable to draw a conclusion as to whether or not this combination therapy has beneficial effect in children with allergic rhinitis or whether the benefits are acceptable in terms of the adverse effects.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Intranasal; Administration, Oral; Adrenal Cortex Hormones [*administration & dosage]; Child; Histamine Antagonists [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial [*drug therapy]; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal [*drug therapy]",10.1002/14651858.CD006989.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006989.pub2,ENT
CD002153,"Nuchprayoon, I; Garner, P",Interventions for preventing reactions to snake antivenom,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,1999,"Abstract - Background Antivenom is used to neutralise snake bite toxins in people showing evidence of envenomation. It is made from animal sera, and adverse effects, including life threatening anaphylaxis, are common. Objectives To assess the effects of drugs given routinely with snake antivenom to prevent adverse effects. Search methods Cochrane controlled trials register; contact with researchers in the field. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized trials testing routine adrenaline (epinephrine), antihistamines, or corticosteroids. Data collection and analysis The two authors applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data. We sought additional data from trialists where required. Main results One trial in Sri Lanka (n = 105) giving adrenaline with polyspecific antivenom showed fewer adverse reactions in the adrenaline group, and this effect was preserved when stratified for severity. One trial in Brazil (n = 101) using three types of Bothrops antivenom showed no benefit of antihistamine drugs. Authors' conclusions Routine prophylactic adrenaline for polyvalent antivenom known to have high adverse event rates seems sensible, based on this one trial. If clinicians believe local factors do not justify routine adrenaline, then they should test their belief in a randomized trial. Antihistamine appears to be of no obvious benefit in preventing acute reactions from antivenoms. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing reactions to snake antivenom People die or can be seriously disabled after being bitten by a venomous snake. Different venomous snake species have different effects on the body, but initial treatment is similar ‐ to try and prevent venom entering the general circulation. If it becomes apparent that the venom has reached the bloodstream, the patients start becoming extremely unwell and in these circumstances health staff may give a specific antivenom (made from horse serum). However, antivenom frequently causes adverse effects which can, in themselves, be severe and result in death. There are drugs that can be given with the antivenom to try to reduce these adverse effects, and these include adrenaline, antihistamines, and steroids. The review looked to assess the benefit of giving these drugs along with the antivenom. The review of trials found one trial of 105 people in Sri Lanka looking at adrenaline; and a second trial of 101 people in Brazil looking at an antihistamine (promethazine).

CD001563.PUB3,"Sheikh, A; Hurwitz, B; Nurmatov, U; van Schayck, CP",House dust mite avoidance measures for perennial allergic rhinitis,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2010,"Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in  The Cochrane Library  in Issue 4, 2001 and previously updated in 2003 and 2007. It is estimated that in developed countries approximately 30% of the general population suffer from one or more allergic disorders, of which allergic rhinitis is particularly common. Perennial rhinitis is most often due to allergy to the house dust mite. In such patients house dust mite avoidance is logical, but there is considerable uncertainty regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce dust mite exposure. Objectives To assess the benefit (and harm) of measures designed to reduce house dust mite exposure in the management of house dust mite sensitive allergic rhinitis. Search methods Our search included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  Issue 4, 2009), MEDLINE and EMBASE. The date of the last search was 31 December 2009. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, with or without blinding, in which house dust mite control measures have been evaluated in comparison with placebo or other dust mite avoidance measures, in patients with clinician‐diagnosed allergic rhinitis and confirmed allergy to dust mite. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, graded methodological quality using the Cochrane approach and extracted data. Meta‐analysis was neither possible nor appropriate due to heterogeneity of the patient groups studied. Main results Nine trials involving 501 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. Only two studies investigating the effectiveness of mite impermeable bedding covers were of good quality; the remaining seven studies were small and of poor quality. Two trials investigated the efficacy of acaricides, another two trials investigated the role of high‐efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. One trial, using a factorial design, investigated the efficacy of both acaricide and house dust mite impermeable bedding covers in isolation and combination; the remaining four trials investigated the efficacy of bedroom environmental control programmes involving use of house dust mite impermeable bedding covers. Seven of the nine trials reported that, when compared with control, the interventions studied resulted in significant reductions in house dust mite load. Of the interventions studied to date, acaricides appear to be the most promising type of intervention, although the findings from these studies need to be interpreted with care because of their methodological limitations. House dust mite impermeable bedding as an isolated intervention is unlikely to offer clinical benefit. No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions. Authors' conclusions Trials to date have on the whole been small and of poor methodological quality, making it difficult to offer any definitive recommendations on the role, if any, of house dust mite avoidance measures in the management of house dust mite sensitive perennial allergic rhinitis. The results of these studies suggest that use of acaricides and extensive bedroom‐based environmental control programmes may be of some benefit in reducing rhinitis symptoms and, if considered appropriate, these should be the interventions of choice. Isolated use of house dust mite impermeable bedding is unlikely to prove effective. Plain language summary House dust mite avoidance measures for perennial allergic rhinitis Perennial allergic rhinitis (all‐year hay fever like symptoms) is an allergic disorder which can be triggered by house dust mites and causes a congested, runny nose, nasal itching and sneezing. Avoiding the allergic triggers (such as house dust mites) should in theory help to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in sensitised individuals. There is limited evidence that measures to reduce the numbers of house dust mites might improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis, but more research is needed to clarify the effectiveness of acaricides (chemicals which kill mites) both as a single intervention and as part of a more multi‐faceted approach incorporating high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, allergy control bedding or both. Overall, this review of trials found that acaricides and extensive bedroom‐based environmental control programmes might reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis for some people, but the evidence is not strong. More research is needed.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Mites; Acaricides; Animals; Bedding and Linens [parasitology, standards]; Dust; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial [parasitology, *prevention & control]; Tick Control [*methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD001563.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001563.pub3,ENT
CD003741.PUB4,"Osborn, DA; Sinn, JKH",Soy formula for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2006,"Abstract - Background Allergies and food reactions in infants and children are common and may be associated with a variety of foods including adapted cow's milk formula. Soy based formulas have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance. However, it is unclear whether they can help prevent allergy and food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance. Objectives To determine the effect of feeding adapted soy formula compared to human milk, cow's milk formula or a hydrolysed protein formula on preventing allergy or food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance. Search methods The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. Updated searches were performed of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 ‐ March 2006), EMBASE (1980 ‐ March 2006), CINAHL (1982 ‐ March 2006) and previous reviews including cross references. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials that compare the use of an adapted soy formula to human milk, an adapted cow's milk or a hydrolysed protein formula for feeding infants without clinical allergy or food intolerance in the first six months of life. Only trials with > 80% follow up of participants and reported in group of assignment were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each review author. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Where no heterogeneity of treatment effect was found, the fixed effect model was used for meta‐analysis. Where significant or apparent heterogeneity was found, results were reported using the random effects model and potential causes of the heterogeneity were sought. Main results Three eligible studies enrolling high risk infants with a history of allergy in a first degree relative were included. No eligible study enrolled infants fed human milk. No study examined the effect of early, short term soy formula feeding. All compared prolonged soy formula to cow's milk formula feeding. One study was of adequate methodology and without unbalanced allergy preventing co‐interventions in treatment groups. One study with unclear allocation concealment and 19.5% losses reported a significant reduction in infant allergy, asthma and allergic rhinitis. However, no other study reported any significant benefits from the use of a soy formula. Meta‐analysis found no significant difference in childhood allergy incidence (2 studies; typical RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37, 1.44). No significant difference was reported in one study in infant asthma (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86, 1.40), infant eczema (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.95, 1.52), childhood eczema prevalence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.73, 1.68), infant rhinitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76, 1.16) or childhood rhinitis prevalence (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73, 2.00). Meta‐analysis found no significant difference in childhood asthma incidence (3 studies, 728 infants; typical RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.26, 1.92), childhood eczema incidence (2 studies, 283 infants; typical RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.90, 2.75) or childhood rhinitis incidence (2 studies, 283 infants; typical RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.06, 8.00). One study reported no significant difference in infant CMPI (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.45, 2.62), infant CMA (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.24, 4.86), childhood soy protein allergy incidence (RR 3.26, 95% CI 0.36, 29.17) and urticaria. No study compared soy formula to hydrolysed protein formula. Authors' conclusions Feeding with a soy formula cannot be recommended for prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants at high risk of allergy or food intolerance. Further research may be warranted to determine the role of soy formulas for prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants unable to be breast fed with a strong family history of allergy or cow's milk protein intolerance. Plain language summary Soy formula for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants When babies are not exclusively breastfed, evidence suggests that using a soy formula instead of a cow's milk formula does not reduce allergies in infants and children. Infant formulas have been designed to try to lower the chances of developing allergy or food intolerance. These formulas include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy formulas. A review of trials found that in infants at high risk of allergy who are unable to completely breastfeed, there is no reduction in allergies in later infancy and childhood associated with feeding soy formula compared to a cow's milk formula. No eligible studies were found that compared a soy with a hydrolysed protein formula.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Infant Formula; Food Hypersensitivity [*prevention & control]; Humans; Infant; Milk Hypersensitivity [etiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Soy Milk [*administration & dosage],10.1002/14651858.CD003741.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003741.pub4,Neonatal
CD003550.PUB2,"Gallo, MF; Grimes, DA; Lopez, LM; Schulz, KF",Nonlatex versus latex male condoms for contraception,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2006,"Abstract - Background The male condom, which consists of a thin sheath placed over the glans and shaft of the penis, is designed to prevent pregnancy by providing a physical barrier against the deposition of semen into the vagina during intercourse. Beginning in the 1990s, nonlatex male condoms made of polyurethane film or synthetic elastomers were developed as alternative male barrier methods for individuals with allergies, sensitivities or preferences that prevented the consistent use of condoms made of latex. Objectives The review sought to evaluate nonlatex male condoms in comparison with latex condoms in terms of contraceptive efficacy, breakage and slippage, safety, and user preferences. Search methods In December 2012, we searched computerized databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTS) of nonlatex condoms (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP). Previous searches also included EMBASE. For the initial review, we wrote to the manufacturers of nonlatex condoms and known investigators to locate other trials not identified in our search. Selection criteria The review included RCTs that evaluated a male nonlatex condom made of polyurethane film or synthetic elastomers in comparison with a latex condom. Data collection and analysis We evaluated all titles and abstracts located in the literature searches for inclusion. Two authors independently extracted data from the identified studies. We analyzed data with RevMan. The Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each outcome of contraceptive efficacy, condom breakage and slippage, discontinuation of use, safety, and user preference. Contraceptive efficacy, early discontinuation, and safety outcomes were also measured with survival analysis techniques. Main results While the eZ·on condom did not protect against pregnancy as well as its latex comparison condom, no differences were found in the typical‐use efficacy between the Avanti and the Standard Tactylon and their latex counterparts. The nonlatex condoms had higher rates of clinical breakage than their latex comparison condoms: the Peto OR for clinical breakage ranged from 2.64 (95% CI 1.63 to 4.28) to 4.95 (95% CI 3.63 to 6.75). Few adverse events were reported. Substantial proportions of participants preferred the nonlatex condom or reported that they would recommend its use to others. Authors' conclusions Although the nonlatex condoms were associated with higher rates of clinical breakage than their latex comparison condoms, the new condoms still provide an acceptable alternative for those with allergies, sensitivities, or preferences that might prevent the consistent use of latex condoms. The contraceptive efficacy of the nonlatex condoms requires more research. Plain language summary Nonlatex compared to latex male condoms for birth control The male condom can prevent pregnancy by keeping sperm out of the birth canal. Nonlatex condoms can be used by people who are allergic or sensitive to latex. Some people may not have used latex condoms because they did not like them. This review compared nonlatex condoms with latex condoms. The main issues were effect on birth control, whether the condom broke or slipped, and which condom people liked. In December 2012, we used a computer to find randomized trials of nonlatex condoms. For the initial review, we also wrote to researchers and makers of nonlatex condoms to find other trials. We included all studies that compared a male nonlatex condom with a latex condom. The eZ·on condom did not prevent pregnancy as well as latex condoms. The Avanti and the Standard Tactylon condoms were similar to latex condoms for birth control. The nonlatex condoms broke more often than the latex condoms. However, many people liked the nonlatex condoms better. They may be useful for people who are allergic or sensitive to latex.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Latex; *Polyurethanes; Condoms [*standards]; Contraception [*instrumentation]; Humans; Male; Polystyrenes; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,10.1002/14651858.CD003550.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003550.pub2,Fertility Regulation
CD004591.PUB3,"Tan‐Dy, CRY; Ohlsson, A",Lactase treated feeds to promote growth and feeding tolerance in preterm infants,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2013,"Abstract - Background Successful transition from parenteral nutrition to full enteral feedings during the immediate neonatal period is associated with improved growth in preterm infants. Lactase is the last of the major intestinal disaccharidases to develop in preterm infants. Because of inadequate lactase activity, preterm infants are unable to digest lactose. Lactase preparations could potentially be used to hydrolyse lactose in formulas and breast milk to minimize lactose malabsorption in preterm infants. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of the addition of lactase to milk compared to placebo or no intervention for the promotion of growth and feeding tolerance in preterm infants. Primary outcomes: weight gain expressed as grams/kg/day, growth expressed as weight, length and head circumference percentile for postmenstrual age (PMA), assessed at birth and at 40 weeks PMA, days to achieve full enteral feeds. Secondary outcomes: several common outcomes associated with preterm birth, and adverse effects. Search methods Electronic and manual searches were conducted in January 2005 of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library , 2004, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2005), EMBASE (1980 to Jan 2005) and CINAHL (1982 to Jan 2005), personal files, bibliographies of identified trials and abstracts by the Pediatric Academic Societies' Meetings and the European Society of Pediatric Research Meetings published in Pediatric Research. The searches were repeated in May 2012 of  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL and abstracts from the Pediatric Academic Societies' Annual Meetings from 2000 to 2012 (Abstracts2View). The Web of Science was searched using the only previously identified trial by Erasmus 2002 as the starting point to search for additional trials that cited this trial. Selection criteria Types of studies: randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials. Participants: preterm infants < 37 weeks PMA. Intervention: addition of lactase to milk versus placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were followed independently by the review authors to assess study quality and report outcomes. Treatment effects, calculated using Review Manager 5, included risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and mean difference (MD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed‐effect model was used for meta‐analyses. We did not perform heterogeneity tests as only one study was identified. Main results The repeat searches conducted in May 2012 did not identify any additional studies for inclusion. One study enrolling 130 infants of 26 to 34 weeks PMA (mean postnatal age at entry 11 days) was identified and no identified study was excluded. The study was a double blind randomized controlled trial of high quality. Lactase treated feeds were initiated when enteral feedings provided > 75% of daily intake. None of the primary outcomes outlined in the protocol for this review and only one of the secondary outcomes, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were reported on. The RR for NEC was 0.32 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.79); the RD was ‐0.02 (95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.03) (a reduction which was not statistically significant). There was a statistically significant increase in weight gain at study day 10 in the lactase treated feeds group but not at any other time points. Overall, there was not a statistically significant effect on weight gain. No adverse effects were noted. Authors' conclusions The only randomized trial to date provides no evidence of significant benefit to preterm infants from adding lactase to their feeds. Further research regarding effectiveness and safety are required before practice recommendations can be made. Randomized controlled trials comparing lactase versus placebo treated feeds and enrolling infants when enteral feeds are introduced are required. The primary and secondary outcomes for effectiveness and safety should include those identified in this review. Plain language summary Lactase treated feeds to promote growth and feeding tolerance in preterm infants Very low birth weight preterm infants are often fed through a tube into a vein (parenterally) as adequate growth and nutrition is important for lung and brain development. Early feeding via the gut (enterally) stimulates motility and digestive activity and is associated with improved growth, but this is not always possible. Lactase is an intestinal enzyme that helps digest milk and is slow to develop in preterm infants after birth. Breast milk contains components that help with lactose digestion. Lactose intolerance is often managed in infants born at term with low‐lactose or lactose‐free formulas, but these do not fulfil the nutrition requirements for preterm infants. Feeding intolerance leaves residual feeds in the stomach prior to the next scheduled feeding and causes abdominal distension, bile stained fluid in the lungs (aspirates), and vomiting. Preparations of lactase could potentially be added to formula or breast milk for preterm infants. There was not a significant effect on weight gain in the one randomized controlled trial identified that investigated addition of lactase. The review authors searched the medical literature thoroughly but found only this one high quality trial enrolling 130 preterm infants. No adverse effects were noted and lactase treated feeds appeared to be well tolerated.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Enteral Nutrition; *Parenteral Nutrition; Humans; Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature [*growth & development]; Lactase [*therapeutic use]; Lactose Intolerance [prevention & control]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Weight Gain",10.1002/14651858.CD004591.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004591.pub3,Neonatal
CD000133.PUB3,"Kramer, MS; Kakuma, R","Maternal dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy or lactation, or both, for preventing or treating atopic disease in the child",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2012,"Abstract - Background Some breastfed infants with atopic eczema benefit from elimination of cow milk, egg, or other antigens from their mother's diet. Maternal dietary antigens are also known to cross the placenta. Objectives To assess the effects of prescribing an antigen avoidance diet during pregnancy or lactation, or both, on maternal and infant nutrition and on the prevention or treatment of atopic disease in the child. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (6 July 2012). Selection criteria All randomized or quasi‐randomized comparisons of maternal dietary antigen avoidance prescribed to pregnant or lactating women. We excluded trials of multimodal interventions that included manipulation of the infant's diet other than breast milk or of non‐dietary aspects of the infant's environment. Data collection and analysis We extracted data from published reports, supplemented by additional information received from the trialists we contacted. Main results The evidence from five trials, involving 952 participants, does not suggest a protective effect of maternal dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy on the incidence of atopic eczema during the first 18 months of life. Data on allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, or both, and urticaria are limited to a single trial each and are insufficient to draw meaningful inferences. Longer‐term atopic outcomes have not been reported. The restricted diet during pregnancy was associated with a slightly but statistically significantly lower mean gestational weight gain, a non‐significantly higher risk of preterm birth, and a non‐significant reduction in mean birthweight. The evidence from two trials, involving 523 participants, did not observe a significant protective effect of maternal antigen avoidance during lactation on the incidence of atopic eczema during the first 18 months or on positive skin‐prick tests to cow milk, egg, or peanut antigen at one, two, or seven years. One crossover trial involving 17 lactating mothers of infants with established atopic eczema found that maternal dietary antigen avoidance was associated with a non‐significant reduction in eczema severity. Authors' conclusions Prescription of an antigen avoidance diet to a high‐risk woman during pregnancy is unlikely to reduce substantially her child's risk of atopic diseases, and such a diet may adversely affect maternal or fetal nutrition, or both. Prescription of an antigen avoidance diet to a high‐risk woman during lactation may reduce her child's risk of developing atopic eczema, but better trials are needed. Dietary antigen avoidance by lactating mothers of infants with atopic eczema may reduce the severity of the eczema, but larger trials are needed. Plain language summary Maternal dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy or lactation, or both, for preventing or treating atopic disease in the child Evidence is inadequate to advise women to avoid specific foods during pregnancy or breastfeeding to protect their children from allergic diseases like eczema and asthma. We included five trials, involving 952 participants. Trials of mothers' avoidance of milk, eggs, and other potentially 'antigenic' foods during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or both, provide inadequate evidence about whether such avoidance helps prevent atopic eczema or asthma in the child. Women who avoided eating these foods gained significantly less weight during pregnancy in the one trial reporting on this outcome, raising the possibility of adverse nutritional effects on the mother or fetus. Finally, one small trial reported an inconclusive response of breastfed infants with atopic eczema when their mothers avoided consumption of cow milk and egg.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Diet, Protein‐Restricted; *Lactation; Allergens [*adverse effects]; Dermatitis, Atopic [prevention & control]; Dietary Proteins [*adverse effects]; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Immediate [*prevention & control]; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors",10.1002/14651858.CD000133.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000133.pub3,Pregnancy and Childbirth
CD004460.PUB2,"Cheng, J; Yang, XN; Liu, X; Zhang, SP",Capsaicin for allergic rhinitis in adults,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2006,"Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in  The Cochrane Library  in Issue 2, 2006. Allergic rhinitis represents a global health problem. Non‐specific nasal hyper‐responsiveness is an important feature of allergic and non‐allergic rhinitis. This phenomenon is believed to result from the effect of allergic inflammation on the sensory nerves that supply the upper airway mucosa. A pharmacological agent that has proved useful in the investigation of effects of neuronal stimulation is capsaicin, the pungent component of hot pepper. Intranasal capsaicin specifically stimulates afferent nerves consisting mostly of unmyelinated C fibers and some myelinated A ‐ delta fibers. As a result it can trigger central and axonal reflexes, the latter being putatively mediated by the release of neuropeptides. Capsaicin, as a blocking agent of neuropeptides, blocks the axon reflex and may exert a curative effect on allergic rhinitis. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of capsaicin for allergic rhinitis in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts;  m RCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 2 September 2009. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of capsaicin for allergic rhinitis in adults. Data collection and analysis Three authors read each paper, blind to its identity. Decisions concerning inclusion were made by simple majority. We all performed quality assessment independently. Main results One small trial did not find evidence that intranasal capsaicin had a therapeutic effect in allergic rhinitis. A small pharmacological effect on clinical histamine dose response was found. After treatment, leukotriene levels in nasal lavage did not increase in the capsaicin group. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to assess the use of capsaicin in clinical practice. Plain language summary Capsaicin for allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is a common health problem affecting between 10% and 25% of the population, and its prevalence is increasing. The symptoms include a running or blocked nose, itching and sneezing. Several drug therapies are available including antihistamines and steroids. Capsaicin, which is the pungent component of hot pepper, has also been used. With repeated doses applied topically it may desensitize the lining of the nose and have a therapeutic effect on allergic rhinitis. The review found one small, low quality randomized controlled trial which did not demonstrate a therapeutic effect of capsaicin on allergic rhinitis symptoms.

CD003570,"Taramarcaz, P; Gibson, PG",Intranasal corticosteroids for asthma control in people with coexisting asthma and rhinitis,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2003,"Abstract - Background Allergic rhinitis and asthma are mediated by similar allergic mechanisms. They may represent two manifestations of the same united airway disease and therefore intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) could improve asthma. Nevertheless none of the asthma guidelines have advocated intranasal corticosteroids for asthma. Objectives To assess the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids on asthma outcomes in people with rhinitis and asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE and reference lists of articles. We also contacted researchers in the field. The last search was conducted in March 2004. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing intranasal corticosteroids to intranasal placebo or to other traditional asthma treatments were included. Intrabronchial corticosteroids were not allowed but a device combining intranasal and intrabronchial corticosteroid was considered as being a primary INCS technique and was therefore also compared to placebo. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Quality assessment for the 14 eligible studies was performed using the Jadad score and by ranking allocation concealment. Statistical analysis for continuous data was done by weighted mean difference or standardised mean difference. Main results Fourteen trials involving 477 people were included. Meta‐analysis for asthma outcomes failed to show a statistically significant benefit of INCS in asthma. However, for symptom scores and forced expiratory volume in one second, the trend favoured a beneficial effect of INCS. For asthma symptom scores (two parallel studies), the standardised mean difference was 0.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.04 to 1.26). Meta‐analysis for forced expiratory volume in one second (five parallel studies) gave a standardised mean difference of 0.31 (95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.65). In the parallel studies, meta‐analysis of peak expiratory flow gave a standardised mean difference of ‐0.10 Litres/min (95% CI ‐0.55 to 0.35) for mean peak flow (three studies). Meta‐analysis for methacholine airway responsiveness (three parallel studies) showed a standardised mean difference of ‐0.20 (‐95% CI 0.64 to 0.24). Authors' conclusions Intranasal corticosteroids were well tolerated. While INCS tended to improve asthma symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second, the results did not reach significance. The combination of intranasal plus intrabronchial corticosteroids should remain the current clinical practice until more research is done. Plain language summary Intranasal corticosteroids for asthma control in people with coexisting asthma and rhinitis It has been suggested for nearly twenty years that nasal sprays containing corticosteroids might improve asthma outcomes in people suffering from both asthma and rhinitis. Intranasal corticosteroids had few side effects in people with mild asthma, but the improvements in symptoms scores and lung function could have arisen by chance. Intranasal corticosteroids may be a promising alternative treatment for patients with rhinitis and mild asthma. More research is needed before considering changing the current practice of prescribing corticosteroids delivered by oral inhalers for asthma, and by nasal sprays for rhinitis.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Intranasal; Adrenal Cortex Hormones [*administration & dosage]; Asthma [complications, *drug therapy]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhinitis [complications, *drug therapy]",10.1002/14651858.CD003570,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003570,Airways
CD008935.PUB2,"Sheikh, A; Simons, FER; Barbour, V; Worth, A",Adrenaline auto‐injectors for the treatment of anaphylaxis with and without cardiovascular collapse in the community,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2012,"Abstract - Background Anaphylaxis is a serious hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Adrenaline (epinephrine) auto‐injectors are recommended as the initial, potentially life‐saving treatment of choice for anaphylaxis in the community, but they are not universally available and have limitations in their use. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of adrenaline (epinephrine) auto‐injectors in relieving respiratory, cardiovascular, and other symptoms during episodes of anaphylaxis that occur in the community. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1950 to January 2012), EMBASE (Ovid SP) (1980 to January 2012 ), CINAHL (EBSCO host) (1982 to January 2012 ), AMED (EBSCO host) (1985 to January 2012 ), LILACS, (BIREME) (1980 to January 2012 ), ISI Web of Science (1950 to January 2012 ). We adapted our search terms for other databases. We also searched websites listing on‐going trials: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio, and the meta Register of Controlled Trials; and contacted pharmaceutical companies who manufacture adrenaline auto‐injectors in an attempt to locate unpublished material. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing auto‐injector administration of adrenaline with any control including no intervention, placebo, or other adrenergic agonists were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion. Main results None of the 1328 studies that were identified satisfied the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Based on this review, we cannot make any new recommendations on the effectiveness of adrenaline auto‐injectors for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Although randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials of high methodological quality are necessary to define the true extent of benefits from the administration of adrenaline in anaphylaxis via an auto‐injector, such trials are unlikely to be performed in individuals experiencing anaphylaxis because of ethical concerns associated with randomization to placebo. There is, however, a need to consider trials in which, for example, auto‐injectors of different doses of adrenaline and differing devices are compared in order to provide greater clarity on the dose and device of choice. Such trials would be practically challenging to conduct. In the absence of appropriate trials, we recommend that adrenaline administration by auto‐injector should still be regarded as the most effective first‐line treatment for the management of anaphylaxis in the community. In countries where auto‐injectors are not commonly used, it may be possible to conduct trials to compare administration of adrenaline via auto‐injector with adrenaline administered by syringe and ampoule, or comparing the effectiveness of two different types of auto‐injector. Plain language summary Adrenaline auto‐injectors for the treatment of anaphylaxis in the community Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. It is commonly triggered by a food, insect sting, medication, or natural rubber latex. The reaction typically occurs without warning and can be a frightening and life‐threatening experience for those at risk and for their families and friends. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is widely advocated as the main treatment in people experiencing anaphylaxis and many people at risk of anaphylaxis are prescribed adrenaline auto‐injectors (such as the Adrenaclick, Anapen, Epipen, Jext, and Twinject) so that they or their families can, if needed, administer adrenaline in the community. Potential problems with adrenaline auto‐injector use include failure to carry the auto‐injector at all times; failure to use it because the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis are not recognized; a preference to use an oral antihistamine; or fear and panic in the emergency. In addition, in many countries adrenaline auto‐injectors are either not available or they are not affordable. The evidence base regarding the effectiveness of adrenaline auto‐injectors is unclear. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature, searching key databases for high quality published and unpublished material on the use of adrenaline auto‐injectors during episodes of anaphylaxis in the community. We also contacted the relevant pharmaceutical companies to see if they had any such information on the topic. Our searches found many studies relating to anaphylaxis and adrenaline auto‐injector use but no randomized controlled trials on this subject. We concluded that the use of adrenaline auto‐injectors in anaphylaxis is based on the best available information at present. There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials for the effectiveness of adrenaline auto‐injectors in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis in the community. Such trials would ideally involve comparison of adrenaline with placebo; however, use of a placebo in anaphylaxis treatment would be unethical. We therefore recommend that auto‐injectors remain the medication of first choice in the treatment of anaphylaxis in the community.",8,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adrenergic Agonists [*administration & dosage]; Anaphylaxis [*drug therapy]; Epinephrine [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Injections, Intramuscular [*instrumentation]; Self Administration [*instrumentation]",10.1002/14651858.CD008935.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008935.pub2,Emergency and Critical Care

Objectives To assess the effects of immunotherapy using extracted insect venom for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have had an allergic reaction to a sting. Search methods We searched the following databases up to February 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), the Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval System, and OpenGrey. There were no language or publication status restrictions to our searches. We searched trials databases, abstracts from recent European and North American allergy meetings, and the references of identified review articles in order to identify further relevant trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of venom immunotherapy using standardised venom extract in insect sting allergy. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias. We identified adverse events from included controlled trials and from a separate analysis of observational studies identified as part of a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Health Technology Assessment. Main results We identified 6 randomised controlled trials and 1 quasi‐randomised controlled trial for inclusion in the review; the total number of participants was 392. The trials had some risk of bias because five of the trials did not blind outcome assessors to treatment allocation. The interventions included ant, bee, and wasp immunotherapy in children or adults with previous systemic or large local reactions to a sting, using sublingual (one trial) or subcutaneous (six trials) VIT. We found that VIT is effective for preventing systemic allergic reaction to an insect sting, which was our primary outcome measure. This applies whether the sting occurs accidentally or is given intentionally as part of a trial procedure. In the trials, 3/113 (2.7%) participants treated with VIT had a subsequent systemic allergic reaction to a sting, compared with 37/93 (39.8%) untreated participants (risk ratio [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.28). The efficacy of VIT was similar across studies; we were unable to identify a patient group or mode of treatment with different efficacy, although these analyses were limited by small numbers. We were unable to confirm whether VIT prevents fatal reactions to insect stings, because of the rarity of this outcome. Venom immunotherapy was also effective for preventing large local reactions to a sting (5 studies; 112 follow‐up stings; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.69) and for improving quality of life (mean difference [MD] in favour of VIT 1.21 points on a 7‐point scale, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.67). We found a significant risk of systemic adverse reaction to VIT treatment: 6 trials reported this outcome, in which 14 of 150 (9.3%) participants treated with VIT and 1 of 135 (0.7%) participants treated with placebo or no treatment suffered a systemic reaction to treatment (RR 8.16, 95% CI 1.53 to 43.46; 2 studies contributed to the effect estimate). Our analysis of 11 observational studies found systemic adverse reactions occurred in 131/921 (14.2%) participants treated with bee venom VIT and 8/289 (2.8%) treated with wasp venom VIT. Authors' conclusions We found venom immunotherapy using extracted insect venom to be an effective therapy for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings, which can improve quality of life. The treatment carries a small but significant risk of systemic adverse reaction. Plain language summary Immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings At least 1 in 200 people have suffered a severe allergic reaction to a sting from a bee, wasp, or ant, and insect stings are the second most common cause of fatal allergic reactions in some countries. Treatment with insect venom, usually given by a course of injections (called venom immunotherapy), is thought to reduce the risk of allergic reactions to an insect sting. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. From analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment.",10,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adult; Allergens [*administration & dosage, adverse effects, immunology]; Animals; Ants [*immunology]; Bee Venoms [*administration & dosage, adverse effects, immunology]; Child; Desensitization, Immunologic [adverse effects, *methods]; Humans; Insect Bites and Stings [immunology, *prevention & control]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Wasp Venoms [*administration & dosage, adverse effects, immunology]",10.1002/14651858.CD008838.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008838.pub2,Skin

Objectives (1) To determine the effect of marine n‐3 fatty acid (fish oil) supplementation in asthma.  (2) To determine the effect of a diet high in fish oil in asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. We also searched bibliographies of retrieved trials and contacted fish oil manufacturers. Searches were current as of May 2010. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials in patients with asthma more than two years of age. The study duration had to be in excess of four weeks. Double blind trials were preferred, but we also reviewed single‐blind and open trials for possible inclusion. All four reviewers read each paper, blind to its identity. Decisions concerning inclusion were made by simple majority. We all performed quality assessment independently. Data collection and analysis The only comparison possible was between marine n‐3 fatty acid supplementation and placebo. There were insufficient trials to examine dietary manipulation alone. Main results Nine randomised controlled trials conducted between 1986 and 2001 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Seven were of parallel design and two were cross‐over studies. Eight compared fish oil with placebo whilst one compared high dose versus low dose marine n‐3 fatty acid supplementation. Two studies were conducted in children, whilst the remaining seven studies were conducted in adults. None of the included studies reported asthma exacerbations, health status or hospital admissions. There was no consistent effect on any of the analysable outcomes: FEV1, peak flow rate, asthma symptoms, asthma medication use or bronchial hyper reactivity. One of the studies performed in children which combined dietary manipulation with fish oil supplementation showed improved peak flow and reduced asthma medication use. There were no adverse events associated with fish oil supplements. Authors' conclusions There is little evidence to recommend that people with asthma supplement or modify their dietary intake of marine n‐3 fatty acids (fish oil) in order to improve their asthma control. Equally, there is no evidence that they are at risk if they do so. Plain language summary Dietary marine fatty acids (fish oil) for asthma in adults and children Eating more fish has been recommended as one way of possibly reducing asthma. Populations (such as Eskimo communities) with diets high in fish also have low rates of asthma. As diets in other communities have become higher in saturated fats, asthma has also increased. The theory has been that an ingredient in fish oil may reduce inflammation. Inflammation causes the swelling in the airways of the lungs that leads to asthma attacks. However, this review of trials found that people with asthma changing their diets to include more fish oil did not improve their asthma.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,Adult; Asthma [*diet therapy]; Child; Dietary Supplements; Fish Oils [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,10.1002/14651858.CD001283,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001283,Airways

The mainstay of treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis remains oral corticosteroids, though this does not completely prevent exacerbations and may not prevent the decline in lung function. Objectives The purpose of this review was to determine the efficacy of azoles in the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. Searches are current as of May 2008. Selection criteria All controlled trials that assessed the effect of azole antifungal agents compared to placebo or other standard therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were reviewed. Patients with cystic fibrosis were not included. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials. Main results Twelve trials were identified, but only three were prospective, randomised and controlled. A total of 94 participants were included. One demonstrated a reduction in immunological markers of disease activity and symptom scores using ketoconazole 400 mg daily for 12 months. There was no significant improvement in lung function. The other two examined the use of itraconazole for 16 weeks. In one there was a reduction in sputum eosinophils by 35% compared to 19% with placebo (p < 0.01). In the same trial, the number of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids was 0.4 per patient with itraconazole compared with 1.3 per patient with placebo (p < 0.03). Meta‐analysis of data from both trials showed that itraconazole treated patients were more likely to have decline in serum IgE over 25% or more (Peto OR 3.30; 95% confidence intervals 1.30 to 8.15). Authors' conclusions Itraconazole modifies the immunologic activation associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and improves clinical outcome, at least over the period of 16 weeks. Adrenal suppression with inhaled corticosteroids and itraconazole is a potential concern. Plain language summary Antifungal drugs (azoles) for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis associated with asthma Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a condition that complicates some people with chronic asthma. Standard treatment for this condition is high doses of oral steroids.

CD001186.PUB2,"Abramson, MJ; Puy, RM; Weiner, JM",Injection allergen immunotherapy for asthma,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2010,"Abstract - Background Allergen specific immunotherapy has long been a controversial treatment for asthma. Although beneficial effects upon clinically relevant outcomes have been demonstrated in randomised controlled trials, there remains a risk of severe and sometimes fatal anaphylaxis. The recommendations of professional bodies have ranged from cautious acceptance to outright dismissal. With increasing interest in new allergen preparations and methods of delivery, we updated the systematic review of allergen specific immunotherapy for asthma. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of allergen specific immunotherapy for asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register up to 2005, Dissertation Abstracts and Current Contents. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials using various forms of allergen specific immunotherapy to treat asthma and reporting at least one clinical outcome. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently assessed eligibility of studies for inclusion. Two authors independently performed quality assessment of studies. Main results Eighty‐eight trials were included (13 new trials). There were 42 trials of immunotherapy for house mite allergy; 27 pollen allergy trials; 10 animal dander allergy trials; two  Cladosporium  mould allergy, two latex and six trials looking at multiple allergens. Concealment of allocation was assessed as clearly adequate in only 16 of these trials. Significant heterogeneity was present in a number of comparisons. Overall, there was a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and medication, and improvement in bronchial hyper‐reactivity following immunotherapy. There was a significant improvement in asthma symptom scores (standardised mean difference ‐0.59, 95% confidence interval ‐0.83 to ‐0.35) and it would have been necessary to treat three patients (95% CI 3 to 5) with immunotherapy to avoid one deterioration in asthma symptoms. Overall it would have been necessary to treat four patients (95% CI 3 to 6) with immunotherapy to avoid one requiring increased medication. Allergen immunotherapy significantly reduced allergen specific bronchial hyper‐reactivity, with some reduction in non‐specific bronchial hyper‐reactivity as well. There was no consistent effect on lung function. If 16 patients were treated with immunotherapy, one would be expected to develop a local adverse reaction. If nine patients were treated with immunotherapy, one would be expected to develop a systemic reaction (of any severity). Authors' conclusions Immunotherapy reduces asthma symptoms and use of asthma medications and improves bronchial hyper‐reactivity.  One trial found that the size of the benefit is possibly comparable to inhaled steroids. The possibility of local or systemic adverse effects (such as anaphylaxis) must be considered. Plain language summary Allergen immunotherapy for the treatment of chronic asthma Injecting allergens under the skin (allergen specific immunotherapy) can reduce asthma and use of medication and improve the sensitivity of the lungs, but with a risk of severe reactions. Asthma attacks can be caused by allergies, pollens, cigarette smoke or air pollution and can be fatal. An allergen is a substance that causes an allergic reaction in a person sensitive to it. Allergen specific immunotherapy involves having injections of increasing amounts of the allergen under the skin. It is also called hyposensitisation or desensitisation, and there is a risk of severe allergic reactions. The review of trials found that immunotherapy can reduce asthma symptoms, the need for medications and the risk of severe asthma attacks after future exposure to the allergen. It is possibly as effective as inhaled steroids. However, there is an increased risk of a lump at the injection site, rash, wheezing, breathlessness and very rarely a fatal allergic reaction.",8,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Allergens [immunology, *therapeutic use]; Anti‐Asthmatic Agents [administration & dosage]; Asthma [immunology, *therapy]; Desensitization, Immunologic [adverse effects, *methods]; Humans; Injections, Subcutaneous; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001186.pub2,Airways
CD001187.PUB3,"Gøtzsche, PC; Johansen, HK",House dust mite control measures for asthma,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2008,"Abstract - Background The major allergen in house dust comes from mites. Chemical, physical and combined methods of reducing mite allergen levels are intended to reduce asthma symptoms in people who are sensitive to house dust mites. Objectives To assess the effects of reducing exposure to house dust mite antigens in the homes of people with mite‐sensitive asthma. Search methods We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Airways Group Register (last search July 2011). No restrictions were placed on language of publication. Selection criteria We included randomised trials of mite control measures versus placebo or no treatment in people with asthma known to be sensitive to house dust mites. Data collection and analysis Two authors applied the trial inclusion criteria and evaluated the data. We contacted trial authors to clarify information. Main results We included 55 trials (3121 patients). Thirty‐seven trials assessed physical methods, including 26 trials employing mattress encasings. Ten trials involved chemical methods and eight trials involved a combination of chemical and physical methods. Despite the fact that many trials were of poor quality and would be expected to exaggerate the reported effect, we did not find an effect of the interventions. For the most frequently reported outcome, peak flow in the morning (1665 patients), the standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.08 to 0.11). There were no statistically significant differences either in number of patients improved (risk ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.27), asthma symptom scores (SMD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.05), or in medication usage (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.07). Authors' conclusions Chemical and physical methods aimed at reducing exposure to house dust mite allergens cannot be recommended. It is doubtful whether further studies, similar to the ones in our review, are worthwhile. If other types of studies are considered, they should be methodologically rigorous and use other methods than those used so far, with careful monitoring of mite exposure and relevant clinical outcomes. Plain language summary Does controlling exposure to house dust mites improve asthma? Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. The prevalence of asthma has increased and it is now the commonest chronic disease among children. Asthma is triggered by allergens (substances that cause an allergic reaction) and house dust presents a problem in some people with asthma. The major allergen in house dust comes from mites and it is hypothesised that controlling exposure to house dust mites will reduce asthma symptoms in people who are sensitive to house dust mites. We included 55 randomised trials on 3121 people with asthma. There are both chemical (10 trials) and physical methods such as mattress encasings (37 trials) of reducing mite allergen levels and we included both types in this review. There were also eight trials that used both physical and chemical methods. Many trials were of poor quality and would therefore be expected to exaggerate the reported effect, but we did not find an effect of the interventions. There was no difference in peak flow (a measure of lung function), asthma symptoms and medication scores, or the number of patients reporting an improvement in their asthma symptoms. While reducing exposure to house dust mites is recommended in guidelines, we did not find an effect of control measures to reduce the exposure to mites or their products. .",2,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Environment, Controlled; *Insecticides; Allergens [*immunology]; Animals; Asthma [immunology, *prevention & control]; Dust; Humans; Mites [*immunology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD001187.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001187.pub3,Airways
CD005604.PUB3,"Chang, AB; Peake, J; McElrea, MS",Anti‐histamines for prolonged non‐specific cough in children,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2008,"Abstract - Background Non‐specific cough is defined as non‐productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including anti‐histamines. Also, anti‐histamines are advocated as an empirical treatment in adults with chronic cough. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of anti‐histamines in treating children with prolonged non‐specific cough. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The latest searches were performed in November 2009. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing anti‐histamines with a placebo or placebo‐like medication with cough as an outcome, where cough is not primarily related to an underlying respiratory disorder such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, or suppurative lung disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Main results Three included therapeutic studies had 182 randomised participants with 162 completing the trials although in one study, children with recurrent wheeze were also included. The four included safety evaluation studies randomised 3166 participants with 2862 completing the trials. Clinical heterogeneity was evident and limited data prevented combining data for meta‐analysis. The two larger therapeutic studies described significant improvement in both the intervention and the placebo/placebo‐like arms with no significant difference between the two groups. In the study with the smallest sample size, cetirizine (a second generation anti‐histamine) was significantly more efficacious than placebo in reducing chronic cough in children associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, and the effect was seen within two weeks of therapy. In contrast three of the larger evaluation studies that enrolled children with allergic rhinitis described a non‐significant increase in cough as an adverse event. Combined data from the four safety evaluation studies revealed a non‐significant difference between groups (OR 1.47 , 95% CI 0.86, 2.49) for cough as an adverse event but the trend favoured the placebo arm. Authors' conclusions This review has significant limitations. However, our finding of uncertain efficacy of anti‐histamines for chronic cough are similar to that for acute cough in children. In contrast to recommendations in adults with chronic cough, anti‐histamines cannot be recommended as empirical therapy for children with chronic cough. If anti‐histamines were to be trialled in these children, current data suggest a clinical response (time to response) occurs within two weeks of therapy. However the use of anti‐histamines in children with non‐specific cough has to be balanced against the well known risk of adverse events especially in very young children. Plain language summary Anti‐histamines for prolonged non‐specific cough in children Children with non‐specific cough are commonly treated with a variety of medications to treat the symptom of cough. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of anti‐histamines in children with prolonged cough that is not related to an underlying respiratory disease, that is, non‐specific chronic cough. We included three therapeutic studies with 182 randomised participants. Two studies found that chronic cough significantly improved in both treatment and placebo groups with no difference between the two groups. One small study however described that children who had chronic cough associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis treated with cetirizine improved significantly more than children on placebo and this difference was evident by two weeks. Four studies that evaluated safety profiles included 3166 randomised participants and described a non significant increase in cough in participants who received the active medication. Despite the limitations of this review, our findings are similar to the review on anti‐histamines for acute cough which showed no good evidence for or against the use of anti‐histamines. In contrast to recommendations in adults with chronic cough, anti‐histamines cannot be recommended as empirical therapy for children with chronic cough.

Allergic rhinitis is a common condition which can significantly impair quality of life. Immunotherapy by injection can significantly reduce symptoms and medication use but its use is limited by the possibility of severe systemic adverse reactions. Immunotherapy by the sublingual route is therefore of considerable interest. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis in adults and children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL (2010, Issue 3); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts;  m RCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 14 August 2009. Selection criteria Randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials of sublingual immunotherapy in adults or children. Primary outcome measures were symptom and medication scores. We also collected adverse event data. Data collection and analysis Two independent authors selected studies and assessed risk of bias. One author extracted data which was rechecked by two other authors. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with a random‐effects model to combine data. Main results We included a total of 60 randomised controlled trials in the review. Forty‐nine were suitable for pooling in meta‐analyses (2333 SLIT, 2256 placebo participants). Overall, we found a significant reduction in symptoms (SMD ‐0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.64 to ‐0.34, P < 0.00001) and medication requirements (SMD ‐0.32; 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.21, P < 0.00001) in participants receiving sublingual immunotherapy compared to placebo. None of the trials included in this review reported severe systemic reactions or anaphylaxis, and none of the systemic reactions reported required the use of adrenaline. Authors' conclusions This updated review reinforces the conclusion of the original 2003 Cochrane Review that sublingual immunotherapy is effective for allergic rhinitis and has been proven to be a safe route of administration. Plain language summary Sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis (including hay fever) Allergic rhinitis is characterised by red, itchy eyes, a blocked and runny nose, and sneezing. The most common causes of allergic rhinitis are different pollens (grass and tree), house dust mites, mould and animal dander. Allergic rhinitis can be intermittent (such as hay fever) or persistent (all year round). The treatment of allergic rhinitis depends on its severity and duration, and is usually based on the use of antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids. If these drugs cannot control symptoms immunotherapy is recommended. Immunotherapy involves the administration of gradually increasing doses of the allergen over a period of time to desensitise the patient. It is the only known treatment that modifies the immune response and treats the cause rather than the symptoms. In reviewing 60 trials we found a significant reduction in symptom and medication scores in patients treated with sublingual immunotherapy compared to placebo. There were no serious adverse reactions reported in the included trials and no patient needed the use of adrenaline. This updated Cochrane Review therefore reinforces the conclusions of the earlier review in confirming the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Sublingual; Adult; Allergens [*administration & dosage]; Child; Desensitization, Immunologic [*methods]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial [*therapy]; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal [*therapy]",10.1002/14651858.CD002893.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002893.pub2,ENT
CD011293.PUB3,"Fortescue, R; Kew, KM; Leung, MShiu Tsun",Sublingual immunotherapy for asthma,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2020,"Abstract - Background Asthma is a common long‐term respiratory disease affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide. Approximately half of people with asthma have an important allergic component to their disease, which may provide an opportunity for targeted treatment. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) aims to reduce asthma symptoms by delivering increasing doses of an allergen (e.g. house dust mite, pollen extract) under the tongue to induce immune tolerance. Fifty‐two studies were identified and synthesised in the original Cochrane Review in 2015, but questions remained about the safety and efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy for people with asthma. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy compared with placebo or standard care for adults and children with asthma. Search methods The original searches for trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles found trials up to 25 March 2015. The most recent search for trials for the current update was conducted on 29 October 2019. Selection criteria We included parallel randomised controlled trials, irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated sublingual immunotherapy versus placebo or as an add‐on to standard asthma management. We included both adults and children with asthma of any severity and with any allergen‐sensitisation pattern. We included studies that recruited participants with asthma, rhinitis, or both, providing at least 80% of trial participants had a diagnosis of asthma. We selected outcomes to reflect recommended outcomes for asthma clinical trials and those most important to people with asthma. Primary outcomes were asthma exacerbations requiring a visit to the emergency department (ED) or admission to hospital, validated measures of quality of life, and all‐cause serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes were asthma symptom scores, exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, response to provocation tests, and dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data, and assessed risk of bias, all of which were cross‐checked for accuracy. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) using random‐effects models. We considered the strength of evidence for all primary and secondary outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results Sixty‐six studies met the inclusion criteria for this update, including 52 studies from the original review. Most studies were double‐blind and placebo‐controlled, varied in duration from one day to three years, and recruited participants with mild or intermittent asthma, often with comorbid allergic rhinitis. Twenty‐three studies recruited adults and teenagers; 31 recruited only children; three recruited both; and nine did not specify. The pattern of reporting and results remained largely unchanged from the original review despite 14 further studies and a 50% increase in participants studied (5077 to 7944). Reporting of primary efficacy outcomes to measure the impact of SLIT on asthma exacerbations and quality of life was infrequent, and selective reporting may have had a serious effect on the completeness of the evidence; 16 studies did not contribute any data, and a further six studies could only be included in a post hoc analysis of all adverse events. Allocation procedures were generally not well described; about a quarter of the studies were at high risk of performance or detection bias (or both); and participant attrition was high or unknown in around half of the studies. The primary outcome in most studies did not align with those of interest to the review (mostly asthma or rhinitis symptoms), and only two small studies reported our primary outcome of exacerbations requiring an ED or hospital visit; the pooled estimate from these studies suggests SLIT may reduce exacerbations compared with placebo or usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 1.20; n = 108; very low‐certainty evidence). Nine studies reporting quality of life could not be combined in a meta‐analysis and, whilst the direction of effect mostly favoured SLIT, the effects were often uncertain and small. SLIT likely does not increase SAEs compared with placebo or usual care, and analysis by risk difference suggests no more than 1 in 100 people taking SLIT will have a serious adverse event (RD −0.0004, 95% CI −0.0072 to 0.0064; participants = 4810; studies = 29; moderate‐certainty evidence). Regarding secondary outcomes, asthma symptom and medication scores were mostly measured with non‐validated scales, which precluded meaningful meta‐analysis or interpretation, but there was a general trend of SLIT benefit over placebo. Changes in ICS use (MD −17.13 µg/d, 95% CI −61.19 to 26.93; low‐certainty evidence), exacerbations requiring oral steroids (studies = 2; no events), and bronchial provocation (SMD 0.99, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.82; low‐certainty evidence) were not often reported. Results were imprecise and included the possibility of important benefit or little effect and, in some cases, potential harm from SLIT. More people taking SLIT had adverse events of any kind compared with control (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.67; high‐certainty evidence; participants = 4251; studies = 27), but events were usually reported to be transient and mild. Lack of data prevented most of the planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Authors' conclusions Despite continued study in the field, the evidence for important outcomes such as exacerbations and quality of life remains too limited to draw clinically useful conclusions about the efficacy of SLIT for people with asthma. Trials mostly recruited mixed populations with mild and intermittent asthma and/or rhinitis and focused on non‐validated symptom and medication scores. The review findings suggest that SLIT may be a safe option for people with well‐controlled mild‐to‐moderate asthma and rhinitis who are likely to be at low risk of serious harm, but the role of SLIT for people with uncontrolled asthma requires further evaluation. Plain language summary Sublingual immunotherapy for asthma Review question We assessed the evidence on the use of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for people with asthma compared with placebo (dummy treatment) or with standard asthma care. We focused on whether SLIT is a good treatment for asthma and whether it is safe. Background Asthma is a long‐term condition that causes breathing problems and cough, which sometimes develop into asthma attacks. This may lead to the need for patients to take extra medication, visit a clinic or a hospital for treatment, or even be admitted to the hospital. Approximately 300 million people worldwide have asthma, and allergies may be an important trigger of asthma symptoms in about half of these people (e.g. house dust mites, pollen). The aim of SLIT is to reduce the body's allergic response that causes asthma symptoms, which is done by giving repeated doses of what the person is allergic to in liquid or tablet form under the tongue. It is currently unclear whether SLIT is more helpful or safer for people with asthma, when compared with placebo or just continuation of normal asthma treatments. Study characteristics We included 66 studies involving 7944 people, which is 2867 more people than the last time we reviewed the evidence. The included studies lasted between one day and three years, and most people in the studies had mild asthma. Both males and females were included, and about half of the studies included only children. Most studies involved people with house dust mites or pollen allergy. The evidence presented here is current to 29 October 2019. Key results Very few included studies recorded the number of people who had asthma attacks or 'exacerbations' leading to a hospital visit or the need for additional medication, possibly because most people in the studies had mild asthma, so it was difficult to tell if they can be reduced by SLIT. A few studies reported quality of life, but they used different scales, so it was unclear if SLIT had a positive effect. Some studies reported that people taking SLIT had fewer asthma symptoms and a reduced need for asthma medication compared with the control group, but studies measured this information in lots of different ways so that it was difficult to combine or assess for accuracy. People receiving SLIT were no more or less likely to experience serious unwanted side effects, but these were generally very rare. We are not confident that this finding would apply to people with more severe asthma. People receiving SLIT were more likely to experience any unwanted side effect, but many of these were mild. Most guidelines for asthma treatment recommend that SLIT should be used only for people with asthma that is difficult to control with standard treatments. However, many of the studies in this review included people with mild asthma, so trials looking at the effects of SLIT for people with more severe asthma are needed. It would be helpful if these studies used standard scales to report their findings, so that in the future results can be combined. Certainty of the evidence The evidence presented in this review is generally of moderate or low certainty, with very few studies reporting outcomes that are important to people with asthma, such as asthma attacks and quality of life. Most studies did not clearly explain how investigators decided which people would receive SLIT and which individuals would receive placebo or normal care, and in some studies, both participants and trial organisers knew which treatment participants were getting, which may have affected the results.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Asthma [*therapy]; Child; Disease Progression; Hospitalization [statistics & numerical data]; Humans; Placebos [therapeutic use]; Pollen; Pyroglyphidae; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhinitis, Allergic [therapy]; Sublingual Immunotherapy [adverse effects, *methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD011293.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011293.pub3,Airways

Different preventive measures such as protective gloves, barrier creams and moisturisers can be used, but it is not clear how effective these are. This is an update of a Cochrane review which was previously published in 2010. Objectives To assess the effects of primary preventive interventions and strategies (physical and behavioural) for preventing OIHD in healthy people (who have no hand dermatitis) who work in occupations where the skin is at risk of damage due to contact with water, detergents, chemicals or other irritants, or from wearing gloves. Search methods We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLlNE, and Embase. We also searched five trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We handsearched two sets of conference proceedings. Selection criteria We included parallel and cross‐over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which examined the effectiveness of barrier creams, moisturisers, gloves, or educational interventions compared to no intervention for the primary prevention of OIHD under field conditions. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were signs and symptoms of OIHD developed during the trials, and the frequency of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. Main results We included nine RCTs involving 2888 participants without occupational irritant hand dermatitis (OIHD) at baseline. Six studies, including 1533 participants, investigated the effects of barrier creams, moisturisers, or both. Three studies, including 1355 participants, assessed the effectiveness of skin protection education on the prevention of OIHD. No studies were eligible that investigated the effects of protective gloves. Among each type of intervention, there was heterogeneity concerning the criteria for assessing signs and symptoms of OIHD, the products, and the occupations. Selection bias, performance bias, and reporting bias were generally unclear across all studies. The risk of detection bias was low in five studies and high in one study. The risk of other biases was low in four studies and high in two studies. The eligible trials involved a variety of participants, including: metal workers exposed to cutting fluids, dye and print factory workers, gut cleaners in swine slaughterhouses, cleaners and kitchen workers, nurse apprentices, hospital employees handling irritants, and hairdressing apprentices. All studies were undertaken at the respective work places. Study duration ranged from four weeks to three years. The participants' ages ranged from 16 to 67 years. Meta‐analyses for barrier creams, moisturisers, a combination of both barrier creams and moisturisers, or skin protection education showed imprecise effects favouring the intervention. Twenty‐nine per cent of participants who applied barrier creams developed signs of OIHD, compared to 33% of the controls, so the risk may be slightly reduced with this measure (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.06; 999 participants; 4 studies; low‐quality evidence). However, this risk reduction may not be clinically important. There may be a clinically important protective effect with the use of moisturisers: in the intervention groups, 13% of participants developed symptoms of OIHD compared to 19% of the controls (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.09; 507 participants; 3 studies; low‐quality evidence). Likewise, there may be a clinically important protective effect from using a combination of barrier creams and moisturisers: 8% of participants in the intervention group developed signs of OIHD, compared to 13% of the controls (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.42; 474 participants; 2 studies; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain whether skin protection education reduces the risk of developing signs of OIHD (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08; 1355 participants; 3 studies; very low‐quality evidence). Twenty‐one per cent of participants who received skin protection education developed signs of OIHD, compared to 28% of the controls. None of the studies addressed the frequency of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects of the products directly. However, in three studies of barrier creams, the reasons for withdrawal from the studies were unrelated to adverse effects. Likewise, in one study of moisturisers plus barrier creams, and in one study of skin protection education, reasons for dropout were unrelated to adverse effects. The remaining studies (one to two in each comparison) reported dropouts without stating how many of them may have been due to adverse reactions to the interventions. We judged the quality of this evidence as moderate, due to the indirectness of the results. The investigated interventions to prevent OIHD probably cause few or no serious adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Moisturisers used alone or in combination with barrier creams may result in a clinically important protective effect, either in the long‐ or short‐term, for the primary prevention of OIHD. Barrier creams alone may have slight protective effect, but this does not appear to be clinically important. The results for all of these comparisons were imprecise, and the low quality of the evidence means that our confidence in the effect estimates is limited. For skin protection education, the results varied substantially across the trials, the effect was imprecise, and the pooled risk reduction was not large enough to be clinically important. The very low quality of the evidence means that we are unsure as to whether skin protection education reduces the risk of developing OIHD. The interventions probably cause few or no serious adverse effects. We conclude that at present there is insufficient evidence to confidently assess the effectiveness of interventions used in the primary prevention of OIHD. This does not necessarily mean that current measures are ineffective. Even though the update of this review included larger studies of reasonable quality, there is still a need for trials which apply standardised measures for the detection of OIHD in order to determine the effectiveness of the different prevention strategies. Plain language summary Treatments to prevent hand skin irritation in the workplace Review question In this review, we set out to assess the available evidence on the effect of barrier creams, moisturisers, gloves, and educational programmes for employees who are at risk of developing irritation of the skin on the hands. We found nine studies. None of them investigated protective gloves. The evidence in this review is current to 17 January 2018. Background Occupational irritant hand dermatitis (OIHD) is a skin disease that occurs on the hands of employees in certain jobs. The first signs are red and scaly patches in the finger webs and on the knuckle area of the hands. Itchy blisters, painful cracks, and possibly infection are common, and eventually the skin becomes thickened. Hand skin irritation can affect employees who regularly come into contact with water, detergents, chemicals, and other irritants, or who wear gloves during their working day. People at particular risk include hairdressers, nurses, cleaners, builders, and people who work in the dye, printing, metal, and food industries. The condition is relatively common and affects about 5 to 20 out of 10,000 full‐time workers per year. Preventing OIHD from developing is important because it is difficult to clear once it starts. Study characteristics We included nine studies in this review, involving 2888 male and female workers aged between 16 and 67. The studies included several types of workers: metal workers, dye and print factory workers, gut cleaners in swine slaughterhouses, cleaners and kitchen workers, hospital employees, and hairdressing apprentices. We were unable to find out whether or not the preventive measures were equally effective in all these professions because there were too few trials. The studies lasted from four weeks up to three years. Key results Some of the preventive measures may reduce the risk of hand skin irritations. However, there were too few studies to be sure of this. The studies were too different from each other to combine in a meaningful way, and the results were too imprecise. Our results are therefore still debatable. Various barrier creams, moisturisers, and skin protection education programs were investigated. It is possible that barrier creams may slightly reduce the risk of developing OIHD. This result was based on four studies. In these studies, 29% of people who applied barrier creams developed hand skin irritations. In the control group, who did not apply barrier creams, 33% developed hand skin irritations. The results of three studies showed that moisturisers may reduce the risk of developing OIHD by a useful amount. Thirteen per cent of the people who used moisturisers developed hand skin irritations, compared to 19% of those who did not use moisturisers. Two studies showed that using a combination of barrier creams and moisturisers may reduce the risk of developing OIHD by a useful amount. Eight per cent of the people who used moisturisers and barrier creams developed hand skin irritations, compared to 13% of the control group. Based on three studies, we are uncertain whether skin protection education reduces the risk of developing OIHD. In these studies, 21% of the people who received skin protection education developed hand skin irritations, compared to 28% of the people in the control group. The safety and tolerability of these measures were not systematically addressed in these studies. However, no serious reactions to the treatments were reported. Mild reactions like itching or reddening of the skin were reported for only few people who applied the barrier creams or moisturisers. The measures to prevent hand skin irritations probably cause only few or no serious adverse effects. Quality of the evidence For barrier creams, moisturisers, or a combination of both, the quality of the evidence was low concerning the prevention of OIHD. There was not enough information and hand dermatitis was assessed differently across the studies. For educational programmes, the quality of the evidence was very low concerning the prevention of hand skin irritation. There was not enough information, hand dermatitis was assessed differently across the studies, and the studies were poorly conducted in some important respects. For the other key outcome, safety and tolerability of the treatments, the quality of the evidence was moderate because only indirect results were available.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Patient Education as Topic; Dermatitis, Irritant [*prevention & control]; Dermatitis, Occupational [*prevention & control]; Emollients [*administration & dosage]; Excipients [administration & dosage]; Gloves, Protective; Hand Dermatoses [*prevention & control]; Humans; Organic Chemicals [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Reduction Behavior",10.1002/14651858.CD004414.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004414.pub3,Skin
CD003664.PUB6,"Osborn, DA; Sinn, JKH; Jones, LJ",Infant formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergic disease,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2018,"Abstract - Background Infant formulas containing hydrolysed proteins have been widely advocated for preventing allergic disease in infants, in place of standard cow’s milk formula (CMF). However, it is unclear whether the clinical trial evidence supports this. Objectives To compare effects on allergic disease when infants are fed a hydrolysed formula versus CMF or human breast milk. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective, including extensively or partially hydrolysed formula (EHF/PHF). To determine whether infants at low or high risk of allergic disease, and whether infants receiving early short‐term (first few days after birth) or prolonged formula feeding benefit from hydrolysed formulas. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1948 to 3 November 2017), and Embase (1974 to 3 November 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles and previous reviews for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. Selection criteria We searched for randomised and quasi‐randomised trials that compared use of a hydrolysed formula versus human milk or CMF. Outcomes with ≥ 80% follow‐up of participants from eligible trials were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data from the included studies. Fixed‐effect analyses were performed. The treatment effects were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals and quality of evidence using the GRADE quality of evidence approach. The primary outcome was all allergic disease (including asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and food allergy). Main results A total of 16 studies were included. Two studies assessed the effect of three to four days infant supplementation with an EHF while in hospital after birth versus pasteurised human milk feed. A single study enrolling 90 infants reported no difference in all allergic disease (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.38 to 5.37) or any specific allergic disease up to childhood including cow's milk allergy (CMA) (RR 7.11, 95% CI 0.35 to 143.84). A single study reported no difference in infant CMA (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.46; participants = 3559). Quality of evidence was assessed as very low for all outcomes. No eligible trials compared prolonged hydrolysed formula versus human milk feeding. Two studies assessed the effect of three to four days infant supplementation with an EHF versus a CMF. A single study enrolling 90 infants reported no difference in all allergic disease (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.33 to 5.71; participants = 77) or any specific allergic disease including CMA up to childhood. A single study reported a reduction in infant CMA of borderline significance (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.00; participants = 3473). Quality of evidence was assessed as very low for all outcomes. Twelve studies assessed the effect of prolonged infant feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF. The data showed no difference in all allergic disease in infants (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01; participants = 2852; studies = 8) and children (typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; participants = 950; studies = 2), and no difference in any specific allergic disease including infant asthma (typical RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.04; participants = 318; studies = 4), eczema (typical RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09; participants = 2896; studies = 9), rhinitis (typical RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.85; participants = 256; studies = 3), food allergy (typical RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.33; participants = 479; studies = 2), and CMA (RR 2.31, 95% CI 0.24 to 21.97; participants = 338; studies = 1). Quality of evidence was assessed as very low for all outcomes. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence to support short‐term or prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with exclusive breast feeding for prevention of allergic disease. Very low‐quality evidence indicates that short‐term use of an EHF compared with a CMF may prevent infant CMA. Further trials are recommended before implementation of this practice. We found no evidence to support prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF for prevention of allergic disease in infants unable to be exclusively breast fed. Plain language summary Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergic disease in infants Review question Does feeding infants with a formula containing hydrolysed protein result in decreased risk of developing allergic disease such as asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever and food allergy during infancy and childhood? Background Allergic disease is responsible for a substantial health burden among infants, children and adults. Early dietary intake may influence the development of allergic disease. When babies are not exclusively breast fed, use of hydrolysed formula instead of ordinary cow's milk formula may reduce allergic disease among babies and children, although additional studies are needed to confirm this. Infant formulas have been designed to lower the chance of infants developing allergic disease. These include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy milk formulas. Hydrolysed formulas break down milk proteins into smaller, potentially less allergy‐producing proteins. Results This review of trials found no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula to prevent allergic disease in preference to exclusive breast feeding. This review also found that for infants who are unable to be exclusively breast fed, there is no evidence that prolonged infant feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a cow's milk is associated with any difference in allergic disease, asthma, eczema, rhinitis, food allergy or cow's milk formula at any time point. However, limited data in infants who are exclusively formula fed suggest that feeding with a hydrolysed formula instead of a cow's milk formula may reduce infant allergic disease. Concerns regarding quality of the evidence and consistency of the results indicate that continued study is needed. The evidence in this review comes from literature searches updated until November 2017. Conclusions We found no substantial evidence to support short‐term or prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a cow's milk formula for prevention of allergic disease in infants unable to be exclusively breast fed.",10,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Dietary Proteins; Animals; Asthma [epidemiology]; Breast Feeding; Dermatitis, Atopic [epidemiology]; Food Hypersensitivity [*prevention & control]; Humans; Infant; Infant Formula [*chemistry]; Infant, Newborn; Milk; Milk Hypersensitivity [prevention & control]; Milk, Human; Protein Hydrolysates [*administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD003664.pub6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003664.pub6,Neonatal

Probiotics have been proposed as an effective treatment for eczema; their use is increasing, as numerous clinical trials are under way. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008, which suggested that probiotics may not be an effective treatment for eczema but identified areas in which evidence was lacking. Objectives To assess the effects of probiotics for treating patients of all ages with eczema. Search methods We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT) database, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched a number of conference proceedings. We updated the searches of the main databases in January 2018 and of trials registries in March 2018, but we have not yet incorporated these results into the review. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of probiotics (live orally ingested micro‐organisms) compared with no treatment, placebo, or other active intervention with no probiotics for the treatment of eczema diagnosed by a doctor. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We recorded adverse events from the included studies and from a separate adverse events search conducted for the first review. We formally assessed reporting bias by preparing funnel plots, and we performed trial sequential analysis for the first primary outcome ‐ eczema symptoms at the end of active treatment. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome (in  italic font ). Main results We included 39 randomised controlled trials involving 2599 randomised participants. We included participants of either gender, aged from the first year of life through to 55 years (only six studies assessed adults), who had mild to severe eczema. Trials were undertaken in primary and secondary healthcare settings, mainly in Europe or Asia. Duration of treatment ranged from four weeks to six months, and duration of follow‐up after end of treatment ranged from zero to 36 months. We selected no standard dose: researchers used a variety of doses and concentrations of probiotics. The probiotics used were bacteria of the  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacteria  species, which were taken alone or combined with other probiotics, and were given with or without prebiotics .  Comparators were no treatment, placebo, and other treatments with no probiotics. For all results described in this abstract, the comparator was no probiotics. Active treatment ranged from six weeks to three months for all of the following results, apart from the investigator‐rated eczema severity outcome, for which the upper limit of active treatment was 16 weeks. With regard to score, the higher the score, the more severe were the symptoms. All key results reported in this abstract were measured at the end of active treatment, except for adverse events, which were measured during the active treatment period. Probiotics probably make little or no difference in participant‐ or parent‐rated symptoms of eczema (13 trials; 754 participants): symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 20 was 0.44 points lower after probiotic treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.22 to 0.33;  moderate‐quality evidence ). Trial sequential analysis shows that target sample sizes of 258 and 456, which are necessary to demonstrate a minimum mean difference of ‐2 and ‐1.5, respectively, with 90% power, have been exceeded, suggesting that further trials with similar probiotic strains for this outcome at the end of active treatment may be futile. We found no evidence suggesting that probiotics make a difference in QoL for patients with eczema (six studies; 552 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.42;  low‐quality evidence ) when measured by the participant or the parent using validated disease‐specific QoL instruments. Probiotics may slightly reduce investigator‐rated eczema severity scores (24 trials; 1596 participants). On a scale of 0 to 103 for total Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), a score combining investigator‐rated eczema severity score and participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss was 3.91 points lower after probiotic treatment than after no probiotic treatment (95% CI ‐5.86 to ‐1.96;  low‐quality evidence ). The minimum clinically important difference for SCORAD has been estimated to be 8.7 points. We noted significant to extreme levels of unexplainable heterogeneity between the results of individual studies. We judged most studies to be at unclear risk of bias; six studies had high attrition bias, and nine were at low risk of bias overall. We found no evidence to show that probiotics make a difference in the risk of adverse events during active treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.63; seven trials; 402 participants;  low‐quality evidence ). Studies in our review that reported adverse effects described gastrointestinal symptoms. Authors' conclusions Evidence suggests that, compared with no probiotic, currently available probiotic strains probably make little or no difference in improving patient‐rated eczema symptoms. Probiotics may make little or no difference in QoL for people with eczema nor in investigator‐rated eczema severity score (combined with participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss); for the latter, the observed effect was small and of uncertain clinical significance. Therefore, use of probiotics for the treatment of eczema is currently not evidence‐based. This update found no evidence of increased adverse effects with probiotic use during studies, but a separate adverse events search from the first review revealed that probiotic treatment carries a small risk of adverse events. Results show significant, unexplainable heterogeneity between individual trial results. Only a small number of studies measured some outcomes. Future studies should better measure QoL scores and adverse events, and should report on new probiotics. Researchers should also consider studying subgroups of patients (e.g. patients with atopy or food allergies, adults) and standardising doses/concentrations of probiotics given. Plain language summary Probiotics for treating eczema Review question This Cochrane Review aimed to find out, by analysing data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), if probiotics (bacteria, fungi, or yeasts) are effective in treating eczema of any severity in people of all ages when compared with placebo (an identical but inactive treatment), no treatment, or another treatment that does not include probiotics. We wanted to find out if treatment with probiotics improves the symptoms, quality of life, or severity of eczema in patients at the end of active treatment and during follow‐up after the active treatment has finished. Background Eczema is an itchy, non‐contagious, inflamed skin condition that affects between 5% and 20% of people at some time in their life. People with eczema have different bacteria in their gut compared to people without eczema, and sometimes they have inflammation in their gut. It has been suggested that eczema symptoms may be treated by changing the mix of gut bacteria or by reducing inflammation in the gut. Probiotics, which are live micro‐organisms taken by mouth, such as the  Lactobacillus  bacteria found in unpasteurised milk and yoghurt, might achieve this. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review published in 2008; this update is important because more trials have been done since publication of the first review, and because use of probiotics is increasing and new treatments for eczema are needed. Study characteristics We included 39 randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with 2599 participants, which we identified in searches up to January 2017. These studies included people of either gender and of all ages, although most studies assessed children who had been told by a healthcare professional that they had eczema. Participants had eczema ranging from mild to severe, and RCTs compared treatment with live micro‐organisms (probiotics) of varying dose and concentration, taken by mouth, versus no treatment, placebo, or another treatment with no probiotics. The probiotics included were bacteria of the  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacteria  species taken alone or in combination with other probiotics for a period ranging from four weeks up to six months. We did not look at studies that were seeking to prevent eczema. Most studies were done in Europe, and some were done in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand ‐ all in a medical setting. Most studies were conducted at a single centre. Reviewers applied no language restrictions on study selection. Ten studies were funded by companies supplying the probiotics, and another four studies did not declare the source of funding. Key results Please note that results in this summary are based on the following: a comparison of probiotic against no probiotic; treatment over six weeks to three months, except for the investigator‐rated eczema severity outcome, for which participants were treated longer (16 weeks); and outcomes measured at the end of the treatment period, apart from adverse events, which were assessed throughout treatment. Unless otherwise stated, outcomes were measured by participants or parents. The included studies assessed a variety of probiotics of differing concentrations or doses. With regard to score, the higher the score, the more severe were the symptoms. We found that currently available probiotics probably make little or no difference in reducing eczema symptoms, such as itching and sleep loss ( moderate‐quality evidence ). However, we did find that these probiotics may slightly reduce the severity of eczema scored by patients and their healthcare professionals in combination ( low‐quality evidence ), although it is uncertain if such a change is meaningful for patients. In terms of patient quality of life, we found no evidence that probiotics make a difference ( low‐quality evidence ). We found no evidence of an increase in adverse events; those reported in included studies that were related to treatment were tummy and gut upset with diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, and colic pains ( low‐quality evidence ). Analysis suggests that further probiotic studies assessing the effects of eczema symptoms may not be worthwhile, as they are unlikely to change the outcome at the end of active treatment. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence supporting our key findings was low, apart from one moderate rating for participant‐rated symptoms of eczema. Reasons for this include variability between studies, which could not be explained, and not enough available data.",11,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Eczema [*therapy]; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Probiotics [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Symptom Assessment; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",10.1002/14651858.CD006135.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006135.pub3,Skin

Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, sneezing and nasal itching, which may affect their quality of life. Nasal irrigation with saline (salty water), also known as nasal douching, washing or lavage, is a procedure that rinses the nasal cavity with isotonic or hypertonic saline solutions. It can be performed with low positive pressure from a spray, pump or squirt bottle, with a nebuliser or with gravity‐based pressure in which the person instils saline into one nostril and allows it to drain out of the other. Saline solutions are available over the counter and can be used alone or as an adjunct to other therapies. Objectives To evaluate the effects of nasal saline irrigation in people with allergic rhinitis. Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 November 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nasal saline irrigation, delivered by any means and with any volume, tonicity and alkalinity, with (a) no nasal saline irrigation or (b) other pharmacological treatments in adults and children with allergic rhinitis. We included studies comparing nasal saline versus no saline, where all participants also received pharmacological treatment (intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines). Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were patient‐reported disease severity and a common adverse effect ‐ epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were disease‐specific health‐related quality of life (HRQL), individual symptom scores, general HRQL, the adverse effects of local irritation or discomfort, ear symptoms (pain or pressure) and nasal endoscopy scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in  italics . Main results We included 14 studies (747 participants). The studies included children (seven studies, 499 participants) and adults (seven studies, 248 participants). No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow‐up. Saline volumes ranged from 'very low' to 'high' volume. Where stated, studies used either hypertonic or isotonic saline solution. Nasal saline  versus  no saline treatment All seven studies (112 adults; 332 children) evaluating this comparison used different scoring systems for  patient‐reported disease severity , so we pooled the data using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Saline irrigation may improve patient‐reported disease severity compared with no saline at up to four weeks (SMD ‐1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.84 to ‐0.81; 407 participants; 6 studies;  low quality ) and between four weeks and three months (SMD ‐1.44, 95% CI ‐2.39 to ‐0.48; 167 participants; 5 studies;  low quality ). Although the evidence was  low quality  the SMD values at both time points are considered large effect sizes. Subgroup analysis showed the improvement in both adults and children. Subgroup analyses for volume and tonicity were inconclusive due to heterogeneity. Two studies reported methods for recording adverse effects and five studies mentioned them. Two studies (240 children) reported no  adverse effects  (epistaxis or local discomfort) in either group and three only reported no adverse effects in the saline group. One study (48 children) reported  disease‐specific HRQL  using a modified RCQ‐36 scale. It was uncertain whether there was a difference between the groups at any of the specified time points ( very low quality ). No other secondary outcomes were reported. Nasal saline  versus  no saline with adjuvant use of intranasal steroids or oral antihistamines Three studies (40 adults; 79 children) compared saline with intranasal steroids versus intranasal steroids alone; one study (14 adults) compared saline with oral antihistamines versus oral antihistamines alone. It is uncertain if there is a difference in  patient‐reported disease severity  at up to four weeks (SMD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.34 to 0.15; 32 participants; 2 studies;  very low quality ) or from four weeks to three months (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.85 to 0.21; 58 participants; 2 studies;  very low quality ). Although none of the studies reported methods for recording  adverse effects , three mentioned them: one study (40 adults; adjuvant intranasal steroids) reported no  adverse effects  (epistaxis or local discomfort) in either group; the other two only reported no adverse effects in the saline group. It is uncertain if saline irrigation in addition to pharmacological treatment improved  disease‐specific HRQL  at four weeks to three months, compared with pharmacological treatment alone (SMD ‐1.26, 95% CI ‐2.47 to ‐0.05; 54 participants; 2 studies;  very low quality ). No other secondary outcomes were reported. Nasal saline  versus  intranasal steroids It is uncertain if there was a difference in  patient‐reported disease severity  between nasal saline and intranasal steroids at up to four weeks (MD 1.06, 95% CI ‐1.65 to 3.77; 14 participants; 1 study), or between four weeks and three months (SMD 1.26, 95% CI ‐0.92 to 3.43; 97 participants; 3 studies), or in disease‐specific HRQL  between four weeks and three months (SMD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.73 to 0.75; 83 participants; 2 studies). Only one study reported methods for recording  adverse effects  although three studies mentioned them. One (21 participants) reported two withdrawals due to adverse effects but did not describe these or state which group. Three studies reported no  adverse effects  (epistaxis or local discomfort) with saline, although one study reported that 27% of participants experienced local discomfort with steroid use. No other secondary outcomes were reported. Authors' conclusions Saline irrigation may reduce patient‐reported disease severity compared with no saline irrigation at up to three months in both adults and children with allergic rhinitis, with no reported adverse effects. No data were available for any outcomes beyond three months. The overall quality of evidence was  low  or  very low.  The included studies were generally small and used a range of different outcome measures to report disease severity scores, with unclear validation. This review did not include direct comparisons of saline types (e.g. different volume, tonicity). Since saline irrigation could provide a cheap, safe and acceptable alternative to intranasal steroids and antihistamines further high‐quality, adequately powered research in this area is warranted. Plain language summary Nasal saline for allergic rhinitis Background Allergic rhinitis is inflammation (swelling and/or irritation) of the inside of the nose caused by allergies. It is common in both children and adults. Allergic rhinitis can be intermittent (fewer than four days per week, or four weeks per year) or persistent (more than four days per week, or four weeks per year). The allergy can be caused by many different things but common allergens (things causing allergy) are: grass or tree pollen, mould, dust mites or animal dander (tiny flakes of skin). People with allergic rhinitis experience symptoms (nasal obstruction, runny nose, nasal itching and sneezing) that may affect their quality of life. Nasal saline irrigation (also known as nasal douche, wash or lavage) is a procedure that rinses the nasal cavity with saline (salt water) solutions. How saline works is not fully understood but it is probably through making the mucus (snot) thinner, making it easier to remove and also removing some of the allergens from the nose that cause irritation. Nasal saline irrigation can be performed with sprays, pumps or squirt bottles. Saline solutions can be isotonic (the same concentration of salt that is found in the body ‐ 0.9% NaCl) or hypertonic (more salty than found in the body ‐ more than 0.9% NaCl). Although saline irrigation is thought to be safe there have been reports of epistaxis (nosebleeds) and irritation or discomfort in the nose and ears. This therapy is available without prescription and can be used alone or as an add‐on to other pharmacological treatment for allergic rhinitis, such as intranasal (in the nose) steroids and oral antihistamines). Search date The evidence is up to date to November 2017. Study characteristics We found 14 studies with a total of 747 participants (260 adults; 487 children). The volume of saline used in the studies varied: five studies used 'very low' volumes (nasal sprays providing less than 5 mL saline per nostril per application), two studies used low‐volume (between 5 and 59 mL saline per nostril per application introduced with a syringe) and four studies used high‐volume solutions (more than 60 mL per nostril per application). Eight studies used hypertonic saline, five used isotonic saline and three studies did not provide this information. Two studies used two different types of saline solutions. Study funding sources Seven studies did not say how they were funded. The other seven were funded either by the investigators' department or research grants from regional or national government. No studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Key results Nasal saline irrigation compared with no saline irrigation Nasal saline irrigation may have benefits in both adults and children in relieving the symptoms of allergic rhinitis compared to no saline irrigation and it is unlikely to be associated with adverse effects. It is not possible to tell from this review whether there is a difference between the different volumes and concentrations of saline solution. Adding nasal saline irrigation onto 'pharmacological' allergic rhinitis treatment It is uncertain whether adding nasal saline irrigation to pharmacological treatment (intranasal steroids or oral antihistamines) helps to improve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis compared to using pharmacological treatments alone. The use of nasal saline irrigation is unlikely to be associated with adverse effects. Nasal saline irrigation compared to 'pharmacological' allergic rhinitis treatment There is not enough evidence to know whether nasal saline irrigation is better, worse or the same as using intranasal steroids. No studies reporting the outcomes we were interested in compared nasal saline irrigation with oral antihistamines. Quality of evidence The overall quality of evidence for nasal saline irrigation compared with no saline treatment was either low quality  (our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect) or  very low quality  (we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect). This was because the studies were mostly very small and used different methods to measure the same outcome. Since saline irrigation could provide a cheap, safe and acceptable alternative to intranasal steroids and antihistamines further high‐quality studies are needed.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Intranasal; Adrenal Cortex Hormones [administration & dosage]; Adult; Child; Histamine Antagonists [administration & dosage]; Humans; Nasal Sprays; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhinitis, Allergic [*therapy]; Sodium Chloride [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Therapeutic Irrigation [adverse effects, methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD012597.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012597.pub2,ENT
CD010638.PUB3,"Romantsik, O; Tosca, MA; Zappettini, S; Calevo, MG",Oral and sublingual immunotherapy for egg allergy,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2018,"Abstract - Background Clinical egg allergy is a common food allergy. Current management relies upon strict allergen avoidance. Oral immunotherapy might be an optional treatment, through desensitization to egg allergen. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of oral and sublingual immunotherapy in children and adults with immunoglobulin E (IgE)‐mediated egg allergy as compared to a placebo treatment or an avoidance strategy. Search methods We searched 13 databases for journal articles, conference proceedings, theses and trials registers using a combination of subject headings and text words (last search 31 March 2017). Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy administered by any protocol with placebo or an elimination diet. Participants were children or adults with clinical egg allergy. Data collection and analysis We retrieved 97 studies from the electronic searches. We selected studies, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. We attempted to contact the study investigators to obtain the unpublished data, wherever possible. We used the I² statistic to assess statistical heterogeneity. We estimated a pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome using a Mantel‐Haenzel fixed‐effect model if statistical heterogeneity was low (I² value less than 50%). We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes using GRADE. Main results We included 10 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria, that involved a total of 439 children (oral immunotherapy 249; control intervention 190), aged 1 year to 18 years. Each study used a different oral immunotherapy protocol; none used sublingual immunotherapy. Three studies used placebo and seven used an egg avoidance diet as the control. Primary outcomes were: an increased amount of egg that can be ingested and tolerated without adverse events while receiving allergen‐specific oral immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy, compared to control; and a complete recovery from egg allergy after completion of oral immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy, compared to control. Most children (82%) in the oral immunotherapy group could ingest a partial serving of egg (1 g to 7.5 g) compared to 10% of control group children (RR 7.48, 95% CI 4.91 to 11.38; RD 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80). Fewer than half (45%) of children receiving oral immunotherapy were able to tolerate a full serving of egg compared to 10% of the control group (RR 4.25, 95% CI 2.77 to 6.53; RD 0.35, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.43). All 10 trials reported numbers of children with serious adverse events (SAEs) and numbers of children with mild‐to‐severe adverse events. SAEs requiring epinephrine/adrenaline presented in 21/249 (8.4%) of children in the oral immunotherapy group, and none in the control group. Mild‐to‐severe adverse events were frequent; 75% of children presented mild‐to‐severe adverse events during oral immunotherapy treatment versus 6.8% of the control group (RR 8.35, 95% CI 5.31 to 13.12). Of note, seven studies used an egg avoidance diet as the control. Adverse events occurred in 4.2% of children, which may relate to accidental ingestion of egg‐containing food. Three studies used a placebo control with adverse events present in 2.6% of children. Overall, there was inconsistent methodological rigour in the trials. All studies enrolled small numbers of children and used different methods to provide oral immunotherapy. Eight included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Furthermore, the quality of evidence was judged to be low due to small numbers of participants and events, and possible biases. Authors' conclusions Frequent and increasing exposure to egg over one to two years in people who are allergic to egg builds tolerance, with almost everyone becoming more tolerant compared with a minority in the control group and almost half of people being totally tolerant of egg by the end of treatment compared with 1 in 10 people who avoid egg. However, nearly all who received treatment experienced adverse events, mainly allergy‐related. We found that 1 in 12 children had serious allergic reactions requiring adrenaline, and some people gave up oral immunotherapy. It appears that oral immunotherapy for egg allergy is effective, but confidence in the trade‐off between benefits and harms is low; because there was a small number of trials with few participants, and methodological problems with some trials. Plain language summary Does giving daily small, steadily increasing amounts of egg protein help people with egg allergy? Background Until recently, the only practical option for people with food allergies was strict avoidance of foods to which they are allergic. It is difficult to avoid egg because it is found in many foods. Even with avoidance, the fear of accidentally eating foods with egg because of mislabelling or cross‐contamination is an ever‐present fear for even the most careful of people with food allergy. Accidentally eating egg‐containing foods can cause life‐threatening events. Oral immunotherapy is a new type of treatment for egg allergy, which is also known as oral desensitization or vaccination. Treatment involves consuming a small amount of egg protein daily, which is gradually increased over time until a full serving is reached. This method could alter the allergic response to the egg protein by the body’s immune system, increasing the amount of egg that can be eaten without inducing adverse reactions. Search date We searched up to March 2017 for this update. Study characteristics We included 10 randomized controlled trials (studies that allocate people randomly by chance to receive treatment) that compared oral immunotherapy to placebo (a fake treatment not containing egg) or an egg‐avoidance diet for people with egg allergy. The 10 studies included a total of 439 children (249 in the oral immunotherapy group (treatment containing egg) and 190 in the control group (no egg)) who were aged from 1 year to 18 years. Key results The evidence showed that treating egg allergy by giving a small, increasing amount of egg may help most children with egg allergy to tolerate a partial serving of egg, so long as they continued to consume a daily amount of egg protein. Side effects were frequent during oral immunotherapy treatment, but were usually mild‐to‐moderate. Nevertheless, 21 of 249 children treated with oral immunotherapy for egg allergy required medicine because of a serious reaction. The studies did not report information about quality of life of children and their families during oral immunotherapy treatment. Quality of the evidence The trials involved small numbers and there were problems with the way they were done, therefore further research is needed.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Desensitization, Immunologic [adverse effects, *methods]; Egg Hypersensitivity [*therapy]; Egg Proteins, Dietary [*administration & dosage, immunology]; Epinephrine [therapeutic use]; Humans; Immunoglobulin E [immunology]; Infant; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sublingual Immunotherapy [adverse effects, methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub3,Tobacco Addiction

CD003563.PUB2,"Singh, M; Jaiswal, N",Dehumidifiers for chronic asthma,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2013,"Abstract - Background Humidity control measures in the home environment of patients with asthma have been recommended, since a warm humid environment favours the growth of house dust mites. However, there is no consensus about the usefulness of these measures. Objectives To study the effect of dehumidification of the home environment on asthma control. Search methods The clinical trials registers of the Cochrane Collaboration and Cochrane Airways Group were searched. Searches were current as of March 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials on the use of humidity control measures in the home environment of patients with asthma were evaluated for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently using a pre‐designed data extraction form by two review authors. Main results A second trial has been added for the 2013 update of this review. The original open‐label trial compared an intervention consisting of mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with or without high efficiency vacuum cleaner fitted in 40 homes of patients with asthma who had positive tests for sensitivity to house dust mite. The new double‐blind trial also compared a mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with a placebo machine in the homes of 120 adults with allergy to house dust mite. The new trial, which was at low risk of bias, showed no significant difference in morning peak flow (mean difference (MD) 13.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.66 to 29.84), which was the primary outcome of the trial. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in evening peak flow only (MD 24.56; 95% CI 8.97 to 40.15). There was no significant difference in quality of life, rescue medication, requirement for oral corticosteroids, visits to the GP, emergency department (ED) or hospitalisations for asthma. There was no significant difference in the house dust mite count and the antigen levels in the new trial, in contrast to the previous trial. Authors' conclusions Evidence on clinical benefits of dehumidification using mechanical ventilation with dehumidifiers remains scanty, and the addition of a new double blind trial to this review does not indicate significant benefit in most measure of control of asthma from such environmental interventions.

CD007263.PUB3,"Basuki, F; Hadiati, DR; Turner, T; McDonald, S; Hakimi, M",Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2019,"Abstract - Background Preterm infants have fewer nutrient reserves at birth than full‐term infants and often receive artificial formula feeds in the absence of expressed breast milk. Although it is generally agreed that feeding must be initiated slowly and advanced with much greater deliberation than in a healthy, full‐term infant, the way in which feeds are introduced and advanced in preterm infants varies widely. This review focuses on whether dilute or full‐strength formula is the preferable mode of introducing feeds in preterm infants for whom expressed breast milk is unavailable. Objectives To assess the effects of dilute versus full‐strength formula on the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, feeding intolerance, weight gain, length of stay in hospital and time to achieve full calorie intake in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants. A secondary objective was to assess the effects of different dilution strategies. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to update the search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 1 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 1 October 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 1 October 2018). We searched clinical trials' registries for ongoing or recently completed trials ( clinicaltrials.gov ; the World Health Organization’s International  Trials Registry  and Platform; and the ISRCTN  Registry ). Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials comparing strengths of formula milk in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants. We excluded studies if infants received formula as a supplement to breast milk. Data collection and analysis We independently assessed studies for inclusion. We collected data using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal, with independent assessment of risk of bias and data extraction. We synthesised mean differences using a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results We included three studies involving 102 preterm or low birth weight infants in the review. The studies compared dilute (double‐volume, half‐strength) formula with full‐strength (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)) formula. We assessed all three studies as having unclear risk of bias due to the likely absence of blinding of study personnel and the potential for selection bias in the largest trial. Data for the primary outcome of necrotising enterocolitis were not reported in any of the studies. We could combine two of the studies (88 infants) in the meta‐analysis. The evidence suggests that dilute formula with double‐volume (half‐strength) may lead to fewer episodes of gastric residuals per day (one study; mean difference (MD) −1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.20 to −0.20; low‐certainty evidence), fewer episodes of gastric residuals per baby until attaining 100 kcal/kg (one study; MD −0.80, 95% CI −1.32 to −0.28; low‐certainty evidence), fewer episodes of vomiting per day (one study; MD −0.04, 95% CI −0.07 to −0.01; low‐certainty evidence) and fewer occurrences of abdominal distension greater than 2 cm (two studies; MD −0.16, 95% CI −0.19 to −0.13; low‐certainty evidence). For the secondary outcomes, data suggest that infants in the dilute formula with double‐volume (half‐strength) group may have attained an adequate energy intake earlier than infants in the full‐strength group (two studies; MD −2.26, 95% CI −2.85 to −1.67; low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups for weight gain one week after commencement of intragastric feeds (one study; MD 0.05 kg, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.15; low‐certainty evidence). Data were not reported for length of hospital stay. Authors' conclusions There is low‐certainty evidence from three small, old trials that use of dilute formula in preterm or low birth weight formula‐fed infants may lead to an important reduction in the time taken for preterm infants to attain an adequate energy intake. However, our confidence in this result is limited due to uncertainty over risk of bias and sparsity of available data. Dilute formula may reduce incidence of feeding intolerance, but the clinical significance of the reduction is uncertain. The impact on serious gastrointestinal problems, including necrotising enterocolitis, was not reported in any of the trials. Further randomised trials are needed to confirm these results. Plain language summary Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants Review question  Is dilute formula milk (e.g. half the strength at double the volume) better tolerated than full‐strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies for whom breast milk is not available?  Background  Babies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements. Expressed breast milk is preferred, but preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available. The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full‐strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach, which is associated with feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, a severe bowel disorder. Study characteristics  The evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half‐strength, double‐volume) with full‐strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis as an outcome. Key results  Infants receiving dilute formula (half‐strength, double‐volume) experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance and achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full‐strength formula (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)). Feeding intolerance  Two measures of feeding intolerance (abdominal distension and episodes of gastric residuals) were reported across the trials. Two trials (88 infants) provided data for abdominal distension and gastric residuals. Infants fed dilute formula experienced 19% (CI 16% to 23%) fewer episodes of abdominal distension (> 2 cm), equivalent to 0.67 episodes per infant in the half‐strength group compared to 0.83 episodes in the full‐strength group. It was not possible to combine data on gastric residuals but both trials reported fewer episodes of gastric residuals in the dilute formula group. The third trial (14 infants) only reported that there was no difference between the groups with respect to these two outcomes. Time to establish full enteral feeding  In two trials (88 infants) infants receiving dilute formula experienced a 22% (CI 16% to 28%) reduction in the number of days required to reach an adequate energy intake (420 joules/kilogram), equivalent to 8 days in the half‐strength group compared to 10.3 days in the full‐strength group. Certainty of evidence  In exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants, low‐certainty evidence shows that diluted formula may lead to an important reduction in the time taken to attain adequate enteral fluid and energy requirements, without increasing indicators of feeding intolerance. The clinical importance of the reduction in episodes of feeding intolerance is unclear. These findings are based on three small, old trials that may be of less relevance to current practice. A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Enterocolitis, Necrotizing [epidemiology, prevention & control]; *Infant Formula; *Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; *Infant, Low Birth Weight; *Infant, Premature; Energy Intake; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Length of Stay; Weight Gain",10.1002/14651858.CD007263.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007263.pub3,Neonatal
CD010288.PUB5,"Jat, KR; Walia, DK; Khairwa, A",Anti‐IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2021,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder with an approximate prevalence of 1 in 3500 live births. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by aspergillus‐induced hypersensitivity with a prevalence of 2% to 15% in people with cystic fibrosis. The mainstay of treatment includes corticosteroids and itraconazole. The treatment with corticosteroids for prolonged periods of time, or repeatedly for exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, may lead to many adverse effects. The monoclonal anti‐IgE antibody, omalizumab, has improved asthma control in severely allergic asthmatics. The drug is given as a subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks. Since allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is also a condition resulting from hypersensitivity to specific allergens, as in asthma, it may be a candidate for therapy using anti‐IgE antibodies. Therefore, anti‐IgE therapy, using agents like omalizumab, may be a potential therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of anti‐IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Last search: 09 September 2021. We searched two ongoing trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials platform). Date of latest search: 16 August 2021. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing anti‐IgE therapy to placebo or other therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. They planned to perform data analysis using Review Manager. Main results Only one study enrolling 14 participants was eligible for inclusion in the review. The double‐blind study compared a daily dose of 600 mg omalizumab or placebo along with twice daily itraconazole and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Treatment lasted six months but the study was terminated prematurely and complete data were not available. We contacted the study investigator and were told that the study was terminated due to the inability to recruit participants into the study despite all reasonable attempts. One or more serious side effects were encountered in six out of nine (66.67%) and one out of five (20%) participants in omalizumab group and placebo group respectively. Authors' conclusions There is lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti‐IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There is a need for large prospective randomized controlled studies of anti‐IgE therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with both clinical and laboratory outcome measures such as steroid requirement, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis exacerbations and lung function. Plain language summary Use of anti‐IgE treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of anti‐IgE therapy for treating allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetically inherited disease which is not uncommon in the Western World. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by extreme sensitivity to aspergillus (a fungus) and may occur in 2% to 15% of people with cystic fibrosis. Corticosteroids and antifungal therapy are the mainstay of treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, but lengthy or repeated use of corticosteroids may lead to serious side effects. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs as a result of the action of IgE antibodies (a type of protein). A drug that acts against these IgE antibodies (anti‐IgE therapy), such as omalizumab, may be a possible treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. The drug is given as an injection below the skin every two to four weeks. The review aimed to show whether anti‐IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis is effective and to highlight any possible side effects. Search date The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021. Study characteristics We could only include one small study in the review (14 participants) and this was stopped early because not enough people agreed to join the study as volunteers. The study lasted six months and compared omalizumab (Xolair®) injections under the skin of the upper arm or the thigh to placebo injections (dummy treatment containing no active medication). Volunteers were given of 600 mg of omalizumab or placebo daily along with itraconazole (an antifungal drug) twice daily and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Key results The full results of the study were not published. Only limited results on side effects were published online. Six out of nine volunteers (66.67%) in the omalizumab group and one out of five volunteers (20%) in the placebo group reported one or more serious side effects. Due to the lack of evidence, we are not able to make recommendations either in favour of, or against the use of, anti‐IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. More research into this treatment is needed.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary [drug therapy]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic; Antifungal Agents [therapeutic use]; Humans; Prospective Studies; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD010288.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010288.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders
CD002777.PUB2,"Perretta, L; Ouldibbat, L; Hagadorn, JI; Brumberg, HL",High versus low medium chain triglyceride content of formula for promoting short‐term growth of preterm infants,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2021,"Abstract - Background In‐hospital growth of preterm infants remains a challenge in clinical practice. The high nutrient demands of preterm infants often lead to growth faltering. For preterm infants who cannot be fed maternal or donor breast milk or may require supplementation, preterm formulas with fat in the form of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) or long chain triglycerides (LCTs) may be chosen to support nutrient utilization and to improve growth. MCTs are easily accessible to the preterm infant with an immature digestive system, and LCTs are beneficial for central nervous system development and visual function. Both have been incorporated into preterm formulas in varying amounts, but their effects on the preterm infant's short‐term growth remain unclear. This is an update of a review originally published in 2002, then in 2007. Objectives To determine the effects of formula containing high as opposed to low MCTs on early growth in preterm infants fed a diet consisting primarily of formula.  Search methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 8), in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily, and Ovid MEDLINE(R); MEDLINE via PubMed for the previous year; and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), on 16 September 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. Selection criteria We included all randomized and quasi‐randomized trials comparing the effects of feeding high versus low MCT formula (for a minimum of five days) on the short‐term growth of preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation) infants. We defined high MCT formula as 30% or more by weight, and low MCT formula as less than 30% by weight. The infants must be on full enteral diets, and the allocated formula must be the predominant source of nutrition. Data collection and analysis The review authors assessed each study's quality and extracted data on growth parameters as well as adverse effects from included studies. All data used in analysis were continuous; therefore, mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were reported. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results We identified 10 eligible trials (253 infants) and extracted relevant growth data from 7 of these trials (136 infants). These studies were found to provide evidence of very low to low certainty. Risk of bias was noted, as few studies described specific methods for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, or blinding. We found no evidence of differences in short‐term growth parameters when high and low MCT formulas were compared. As compared to low MCT formula, preterm infants fed high MCT formula showed little to no difference in weight gain velocity (g/kg/d) during the intervention, with a typical mean difference (MD) of ‐0.21 g/kg/d (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.24 to 0.83; 6 studies, 118 infants; low‐certainty evidence). The analysis for weight gain (g/d) did not show evidence of differences, with an MD of 0.00 g/d (95% CI ‐5.93 to 5.93; 1 study, 18 infants; very low‐certainty evidence), finding an average weight gain of 20 ± 5.9 versus 20 ± 6.9 g/d for high and low MCT groups, respectively. We found that length gain showed no difference between low and high MCT formulas, with a typical MD of 0.10 cm/week (95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.29; 3 studies, 61 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Head circumference gain also showed little to no difference during the intervention period, with an MD of ‐0.04 cm/week (95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.09; 3 studies, 61 infants; low‐certainty evidence). Two studies reported skinfold thickness with different measurement definitions, and evidence was insufficient to determine if there was a difference (2 studies, 32 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). There are conflicting data (5 studies) as to formula tolerance, with 4 studies reporting narrative results of no observed clinical difference and 1 study reporting higher incidence of signs of gastrointestinal intolerance in high MCT formula groups. There is no evidence of effect on the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), based on small numbers in two trials. Review authors found no studies addressing long‐term growth parameters or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Authors' conclusions We found evidence of very low to low certainty suggesting no differences among short‐term growth data for infants fed low versus high MCT formulas. Due to lack of evidence and uncertainty, neither formula type could be concluded to improve short‐term growth outcomes or have fewer adverse effects. Further studies are necessary because the results from included studies are imprecise due to small numbers and do not address important long‐term outcomes. Additional research should aim to clarify effects on formula tolerance and on long‐term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and should include larger study populations to better evaluate effect on NEC incidence. Plain language summary High versus low medium chain triglyceride content of formula for promoting short‐term growth of preterm infants Review question How does high versus low medium chain triglyceride content of formula impact short‐term growth of preterm infants? Background Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans. Fat provides about half of the energy source (calories) in human breast milk, mostly as long chain fatty acid triglycerides (LCTs). Nutrition is essential for growth, metabolism, and immunity. Impaired weight gain and growth in preterm infants are significantly associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Poor nutrition has been linked to inadequate head growth and thus poor psychomotor and mental skills, higher rates of cerebral palsy, and autism. As a way of improving growth, fat can be added to formula used to feed preterm infants who cannot be fed maternal or donor breast milk or who may require supplementation. Fats in formula can contain triglycerides with long chain fatty acids or shorter medium chain fatty acids (MCTs). MCTs are more easily absorbed by the newborn infant with an immature digestive system. LCTs are still important for development of visual acuity and development of cell membranes and the brain. Study characteristics We included 10 small studies that compared the effects of feeding high versus low MCT formulas (for a minimum of 5 days) on short‐term growth (weight, length, and head circumference gain) of preterm infants. These infants had a mean gestational age between 29 and 32 weeks, mean birth weight between 1 kg and 1.5 kg, and mean age of one to six weeks. The evidence is up to date as of September 2020. Key results The pattern of growth in infants fed high MCT versus low MCT formula shows little to no difference in any of the primary short‐term growth outcomes.  Certainty of evidence We found little to no difference in short‐term growth outcomes among premature infants fed either low MCT or high MCT formulas. The small number of trials (10), each containing a small study population, may be responsible for lack of evidence of a difference. We found evidence of very low to low certainty. Certainty is defined as low if confidence in the result is limited, meaning the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants may be substantially different from the results of this review. Certainty is defined as very low if there is little confidence in the estimate of effect, which is likely to be substantially different from the results of this review.

They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy. Objectives Primary objective To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants. Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy. Search methods We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  Selection criteria We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (≤ 12 months) without pre‐existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow‐up was required. Data collection and analysis This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta‐analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E‐mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician‐assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen. Main results We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review.  We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta‐analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta‐analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only.   Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty‐five studies, including all those contributing data to meta‐analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta‐analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow‐up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE‐mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low‐certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low‐certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow’s milk, and may be unreliable due to over‐reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low‐certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin ( FLG ) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434,   or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development. Authors' conclusions Based on low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy. Plain language summary Skin care interventions for preventing eczema and food allergy Does moisturising baby skin prevent eczema or food allergies? Key messages Skin care treatments in babies, such as using moisturisers on the skin during the first year of life, probably do not prevent babies from developing eczema; may increase the chance of food allergy; and probably increase the chance of skin infection. This review looked at the prevention of eczema and food allergy only. Skin care treatments are still important to treat eczema.  What are allergies? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful. An allergy is a reaction of the body's immune system to a particular food or substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless. Different allergies affect different parts of the body, and their effects can be mild or serious. Food allergies and eczema Eczema is a common skin condition  that causes dry, itchy, cracked skin. Eczema is common in children, often developing before their first birthday, and may be long‐lasting. Allergies to food can cause itching in the mouth, a raised itchy red rash, swelling of the face, stomach symptoms, or difficulty breathing. They usually happen within two hours after a food is eaten. People with food allergies often have other allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema. Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to learn how skin care affects the risk of a baby developing eczema or food allergies. Skin care treatments included: • putting moisturisers on a baby's skin; • bathing babies with water containing moisturisers or moisturising oils; • advising parents to use less soap, or to bathe their child less often; • using water softeners.  We also wanted to know if these skin care treatments cause any unwanted effects.  What did we do? We searched for studies of different types of skin care for healthy babies (aged up to one year) with no previous food allergy, eczema, or other skin condition. Search date:  we incorporated evidence published up to July 2021. We were interested in studies that reported: • how many children developed eczema, or food allergy, by age one to three years; • how severe the eczema was (according to a researcher and to parents); • how long it took for eczema to develop; • parents' reports of immediate (under two hours) reactions to a food allergen; • how many children developed sensitivity to a particular food allergen; • any unwanted effects. We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each study to determine how reliable the results might be, and then combined the results of the relevant studies and looked at overall effects.   What we found We found 33 studies, involving 25,827 babies, that assessed any type of skin intervention. The included studies took place in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the USA, most often at children's hospitals. Skin care was compared against no skin care or usual skin care for babies in that country. Treatment and follow‐up times ranged from 24 hours to three years. Many studies (13) tested the use of moisturisers; the other studies mainly tested the use of bathing and cleansing products and how often they were used. Of the 33 included studies, only 11 studies had comparable outcomes of eczema, food allergy, or adverse effects and were combined for analysis. All of these studies enrolled babies before they were one month old, and  eight of these studies included babies thought to be at high risk for developing eczema.  What are the main results of our review? Compared to no skin care or standard care, moisturisers: • probably do not change the chance of developing eczema by age one to three years (7 studies; 3075 babies), or the time needed for eczema to develop (9 studies; 3349 babies); • may increase the chance of developing a food allergy as judged by a researcher (1 study; 976 babies) by age one to three years; • may slightly increase the number of immediate reactions to a common food allergen at two years, as reported by parents (1 study; 1171 babies); • probably cause more skin infections (6 studies; 2728 babies); • may increase unwanted effects, such as a stinging feeling or an allergic reaction to moisturisers (4 studies; 343 babies); • may increase the chance of babies slipping (4 studies; 2538 babies); • may not affect the chance of developing sensitivity to food allergens (3 studies; 1797 babies) by age one to three years. Confidence in our results We are moderately confident in our results for developing eczema and the time needed to develop eczema. We are less confident about our results for food allergy or sensitivity, which are based on small numbers of studies with widely varying results. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. Our confidence in the review findings for skin infections is moderate, but low for stinging or allergic reactions and slipping.

Adrenaline is recommended as the initial treatment of choice for anaphylaxis. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of adrenaline (epinephrine) in the treatment of anaphylaxis. Search methods In the previous version of our review, we searched the databases until March 2007. In this version we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2010), EMBASE (1966 to November 2010), CINAHL (1982 to November 2010), BIOSIS (to November 2010), ISI Web of Knowledge (to November 2010 and LILACS (1982 to November 2010). We also searched websites listing ongoing trials and contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material. Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing adrenaline with no intervention, placebo or other adrenergic agonists were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion. Main results We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Based on this review, we are unable to make any new recommendations on the use of adrenaline for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Although there is a need for randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials of high methodological quality in order to define the true extent of benefits from the administration of adrenaline in anaphylaxis, such trials are unlikely to be performed in individuals with anaphylaxis. Indeed, they might be unethical because prompt treatment with adrenaline is deemed to be critically important for survival in anaphylaxis. Also, such studies would be difficult to conduct because anaphylactic episodes usually occur without warning, often in a non‐medical setting, and differ in severity both among individuals and from one episode to another in the same individual. Consequently, obtaining baseline measurements and frequent timed measurements might be difficult, or impossible, to obtain. In the absence of appropriate trials, we recommend, albeit on the basis of less than optimal evidence, that adrenaline administration by intramuscular (i.m.) injection should still be regarded as first‐line treatment for the management of anaphylaxis. Plain language summary Adrenaline for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. It is commonly triggered by a food, insect sting, medication, or natural rubber latex. The reaction occurs without warning and can be a frightening experience for those at risk and for their families and friends. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is widely advocated as the main treatment in those individuals experiencing anaphylaxis. There is no other medication with a similar effect on the many body systems that are potentially involved in anaphylaxis. The evidence base in support of the use of adrenaline is unclear. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature searching key databases for high quality published and unpublished material on the use of adrenaline for emergency treatment; in addition, we contacted experts in this area and the relevant pharmaceutical companies. Our searches retrieved no randomized controlled trials on this subject. We concluded that the use of adrenaline in anaphylaxis is based on tradition and on evidence from fatality series in which most individuals dying from anaphylaxis had not received prompt adrenaline treatment. Adrenaline appears to be life saving when injected promptly, however, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials for or against the use of adrenaline in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis. Given the infrequency of anaphylaxis, its unpredictability and the speed of onset of reactions, conducting such trials is fraught with ethical and methodological difficulties.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adrenergic Agonists [*therapeutic use]; Anaphylaxis [complications, *drug therapy]; Epinephrine [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Shock [complications, *drug therapy]; Vasoconstrictor Agents [therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD006312.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006312.pub2,Emergency and Critical Care

Main results Three trials involving a total of 79 participants were included. All three trials, which compared topical nasal steroids against placebo for perennial rhinitis, provided some, albeit limited data, relevant to our primary outcomes; but in two of the trials the data analysis was flawed and in the third trial it was incomprehensible. None of the trials provided data relevant to our secondary outcomes. There were no adverse events reported from any of the interventions. Authors' conclusions The three included trials provided some weak and unreliable evidence for the effectiveness of Beconase® and flunisolide used topically intranasally for the treatment of intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children. The reduction of severity in symptoms as assessed by the trialists could not be confirmed with the data provided and decisions on the use of these medications should, until such time as more robust evidence is available, be guided by the physician's clinical experience and patients' individual circumstances and preferences. Plain language summary Topical nasal steroids for intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children Allergic rhinitis is a very common chronic illness affecting 10% to 40% of children worldwide. There has been a significant increase in prevalence among children over the last two decades and this increase has been accompanied by a parallel increase in comorbid illnesses such as asthma. Symptoms include sneezing, itching, runny nose and nasal congestion. Allergic rhinitis may be defined as 'persistent' or 'intermittent'. These classifications loosely correspond to perennial (all year round) allergic rhinitis and seasonal allergic rhinitis ('hay fever'). There are a wide range of drug treatments available including topical and oral decongestants, topical and oral antihistamines, topical and systemic corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists and a number of over the counter preparations. Topical steroids (nasal sprays) are often prescribed, and act directly on the nasal mucosa to reduce symptoms. The authors of the review identified a large number of randomised controlled trials, however many were excluded due to the use of 'rescue' (additional) medication, which may have confounded the results. The three included trials provided some weak and unreliable evidence for the effectiveness of Beconase® and flunisolide used topically in the nose for the treatment of intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children.

If asthma is a multi‐factorial disease, it is hypothesised that prevention might only prove effective if most or all relevant environmental factors are simultaneously avoided. Objectives To assess effect(s) of monofaceted and multifaceted interventions compared with control interventions in preventing asthma and asthma symptoms in high risk children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (January 2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of allergen exposure reduction for the primary prevention of asthma in children. Interventions were multifaceted (reducing exposure to both inhalant and food allergens) or monofaceted (reducing exposure to either inhalant or food allergens) Follow up had to be from birth (or during pregnancy) up to a minimum of two years of age. Data collection and analysis We included in the analysis studies assessing the primary outcome (current diagnosis: asthma) and/or one of the secondary outcomes (current respiratory symptoms: wheezing, nocturnal coughing and dyspnoea). We pooled multifaceted and monofaceted intervention trials separately. We made an indirect comparison of their effects using tests for interaction to calculate relative odds ratios. Main results We included three multifaceted and six monofaceted intervention studies (3271 children). Physician diagnosed asthma in children less than five years, and asthma as defined by respiratory symptoms and lung function criteria in children aged five years and older, both favoured treatment with a multifaceted intervention compared to usual care (< 5 years: odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.96, and > 5 years: OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85).

Indirect comparison between these treatments did not demonstrate a significant difference between multiple interventions and mono‐interventions in reducing the frequency of asthma diagnosis in children under five years (relative OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.04, P = 0.07) or five years and older (relative OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.13, P = 0.12). There was also no significant difference between either mono‐ and multifaceted intervention and control in reducing the likelihood of symptoms of nocturnal coughing at follow up. Wheezing, however, showed a significant difference between multifaceted and mono‐interventions (relative OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, P = 0.04), but the significance was lost when data on treatment only was analysed. Authors' conclusions The available evidence suggests that the reduction of exposure to multiple allergens compared to usual care reduces the likelihood of a current diagnosis of asthma in children (at ages < 5 years and 5 years and older). Mono‐intervention studies have not produced effects which are statistically significant compared with control. In children who are at risk of developing childhood asthma, multifaceted interventions, characterised by dietary allergen reduction and environmental remediation, reduce the odds of a physician diagnosis of asthma later in childhood by half. This translates to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 17. The effect of multi‐faceted interventions on parent reported wheeze was inconsistent and had no significant impact on nocturnal coughing or dyspnoea. Data from monofaceted intervention exposed children studies were not significantly different from those of control groups for all outcomes. There remains uncertainty as to whether multiple interventions are more effective than mono‐component interventions. The comparisons made were indirect, making the conclusions drawn uncertain. To our knowledge there are no ongoing studies in which both intervention strategies are randomly compared. The findings, however, warrant further direct comparison between multiple‐ and monofaceted interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of asthma in children. Plain language summary Mono and multifaceted allergen reducing interventions for the primary prevention of asthma in children at high risk of developing asthma It is possible that early exposure to allergens (substances which cause allergy) may lead to development of asthma in high risk children. This review asks whether the risk of developing asthma, which is a disease caused by many factors, can be decreased by reducing single allergen levels in children with genetic susceptibility, or whether the reduction of more than one type of allergen exposure simultaneously will lead to a better outcome. As a direct comparison could not be made using current research we made indirect comparisons using trials that had compared single or multiple interventions with a control. In children who are at risk of developing childhood asthma 'multifaceted' interventions, which involve both dietary allergen reduction and environmental change to reduce exposure to inhaled allergens, reduce the odds of a doctor diagnosing asthma later in childhood by half. However, the effect of these multifaceted interventions on wheeze reported by parents was inconsistent and there was no beneficial effect on night‐time coughing or breathlessness. Single ('monofaceted') interventions were not significantly more effective than controls in the reduction of all outcomes, but there remains uncertainty as to whether multiple interventions are more effective than single component interventions.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Allergens; Asthma [*prevention & control]; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure [*prevention & control]; Food Hypersensitivity [*prevention & control]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors",10.1002/14651858.CD006480.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006480.pub2,Airways

Probiotics are live bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract and provide a health benefit to the host. Probiotics added to infant feeds have the potential to prevent sensitisation of infants to dietary allergens. Objectives To determine the effect of probiotics given to infants for the prevention of allergic disease or food hypersensitivity. Search methods This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 ‐ February 2007), EMBASE, PREMEDLINE, abstracts of conference proceedings and citations of published articles, and expert informants. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compare the use of a probiotic to no probiotic; or the use a specific probiotic compared to a different probiotic; or a probiotic with added prebiotic to control. Data collection and analysis Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data were performed using standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results Twelve studies were eligible for inclusion. Allergic disease and / or food hypersensitivity outcomes were assessed by 6 studies enrolling 2080 infants, but outcomes for only 1549 infants were reported. Studies generally had adequate randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding of treatment. However, the findings of this review should be treated with caution due to excess losses in patient follow‐up (17% to 61%). Meta‐analysis of five studies reporting the outcomes of 1477 infants found a significant reduction in infant eczema (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70, 0.95). However, there was significant and substantial heterogeneity between studies. One study reported that the difference in eczema between groups persisted to 4 years age. When the analysis was restricted to studies reporting atopic eczema (confirmed by skin prick test or specific IgE), the findings were no longer significant (typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62, 1.02). All studies reporting significant benefits used probiotic supplements containing L. rhamnosus and enrolled infants at high risk of allergy. No other benefits were reported for any other allergic disease or food hypersensitivity outcome. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics to infant feeds for prevention of allergic disease or food hypersensitivity. Although there was a reduction in clinical eczema in infants, this effect was not consistent between studies and caution is advised in view of methodological concerns regarding included studies. Further studies are required to determine whether the findings are reproducible. Plain language summary Probiotics in infants for prevention of allergic disease and food hypersensitivity There is insufficient evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics to infant feeds for prevention of allergic disease or food reactions. Reactions to foods and allergies (including asthma, eczema and hay fever) are common and may be increasing in developed countries. Many infants become sensitised to foods, including infant formula, through their gastrointestinal tract, a process that may be affected by the composition of the intestinal bacteria. Attempts to promote the growth of normal gastrointestinal bacteria and prevent sensitisation to foods have included the use of probiotics. Probiotics are live bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract and provide a health benefit to the host. This review found that probiotics added to infant feeds may help prevent infant eczema, with one study suggesting the benefit may persist to four years of age. However, concerns regarding the quality of studies, inconsistency of findings between studies, and the fact that the benefits did not persist if restricted to infants with evidence of sensitisation to allergens, suggests that further studies are needed to confirm these results.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Food Hypersensitivity [prevention & control]; Humans; Hypersensitivity [*prevention & control]; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Milk Hypersensitivity [prevention & control]; Probiotics [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD006475.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006475.pub2,Neonatal

Objectives To determine the effect of prebiotic given to infants for the prevention of allergy. Search methods We performed an updated search in August 2012 of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, citations, expert informants and clinical trials registries. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared the use of a prebiotic to no prebiotic, or a specific prebiotic compared to a different prebiotic in infants for prevention of allergy. Data collection and analysis Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data were performed using the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results The 2012 update identified 13 studies classified as ongoing or awaiting classification (yet to report allergy outcomes). Forty‐three studies were excluded, primarily as no allergy data were reported, although none of these enrolled infants were at high risk of allergy. Four studies enrolling 1428 infants were eligible for inclusion. All studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Allergy outcomes were reported from four months to two years of age. Meta‐analysis of two studies (226 infants) found no significant difference in infant asthma although significant heterogeneity was found between studies. Meta‐analysis of four studies found a significant reduction in eczema (1218 infants, typical risk ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.97; typical risk difference ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.07 to ‐0.00; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25, 95% CI 14 to > 100; P = 0.03). No statistically significant heterogeneity was found between studies. One study reported no significant difference in urticaria. No statistically significant subgroup differences were found according to infant risk of allergy or type of infant feed. However, individual studies reported a significant reduction in asthma and eczema from supplementation with a mixture of galacto‐ and fructo‐oligosaccharide (GOS/FOS 9:1 ratio) (8 g/L) in infants at high risk of allergy; and in eczema from supplementation with GOS/FOS (9:1) (6.8 g/L) and acidic oligosacccharide (1.2 g/L) in infants not selected for allergy risk. Authors' conclusions Further research is needed before routine use of prebiotics can be recommended for prevention of allergy in formula fed infants. There is some evidence that a prebiotic supplement added to infant feeds may prevent eczema. It is unclear whether the use of prebiotic should be restricted to infants at high risk of allergy or may have an effect in low risk populations; or whether it may have an effect on other allergic diseases including asthma. Plain language summary Prebiotics in infants for prevention of allergic disease and food allergy There is some evidence that prebiotic added to infant formula may prevent eczema and asthma in infants. However, there is some concern about the reliability of the evidence due to not all trials reporting allergy outcomes and trials not reporting the outcome for all infants. Reactions to foods and allergies (including asthma, eczema and hay fever) are common and may be increasing. Many infants become sensitised to foods, including infant formula, through their gastrointestinal tract, a process that may be affected by the composition of the intestinal bacteria. Attempts to promote the growth of normal gastrointestinal bacteria and prevent sensitisation to foods have included the addition of prebiotic to infant formula. Prebiotics are nondigestible food components that help by selectively stimulating the growth or activity of 'healthy' bacteria in the colon. This review found some evidence that a prebiotic supplement added to infant feeds may prevent eczema in infants up to two years of age. It is unclear whether the use of prebiotic should be restricted to infants at high risk of allergy or may have an effect in low risk populations; or whether it may have an effect on other allergic diseases including asthma.

Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) is an effective and well‐tolerated treatment for allergic rhinitis, but its effects on symptoms of ocular allergy have not been well established. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of SLIT compared with placebo for reductions in ocular symptoms, topical ocular medication requirements and conjunctival immediate allergen sensitivity. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2011), Web of Science (January 1970 to January 2011), Biosis Previews, (January 1979 to January 2011), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) ( www.controlled‐trials.com ) (January 2011), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) (January 2011), the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ( www.actr.org.au ) (July 2010), SCOPUS (November 2008) and the UK Clinical Trials Gateway (January 2010). There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. All electronic databases except for SCOPUS, the UK Clinical Trials Gateway and ANZCTR were last searched on 19 January 2011. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), double‐masked and placebo controlled, which evaluated the efficacy of SLIT in patients with symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) or allergic conjunctivitis (AC). Data collection and analysis The primary outcome was the total ocular symptom scores. Secondary endpoints included individual ocular symptom scores (such as itchy eyes, red eyes, watery eyes, swollen eyes), ocular medication scores (eye drops) and conjunctival immediate allergen sensitivity (CIAS). Data were analysed and reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) using Review Manager software. Main results Forty‐two trials (n = 3958 total participants; n= 2011 SLIT and n = 1947 placebo) had available data to evaluate the efficacy of SLIT on AC and were included in the meta‐analyses. Heterogeneity among studies (I 2  statistic) was around 50% or below for all endpoints. Sublingual immunotherapy induced a significant reduction in both total ocular symptom scores (SMD ‐0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.53 to ‐0.28; P < 0.00001; I 2  = 59%) and individual ocular symptom scores for red eyes (SMD ‐0.33; 95% CI ‐0.45 to ‐0.22; P < 0.00001; I 2  = 27%), itchy eyes (SMD ‐0.31; 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.20; P < 0.00001; I 2  = 46%) and watery eyes (SMD ‐0.23; 95% CI ‐0.34 to ‐0.11; P < 0.0001; I 2  = 42%) compared to placebo. Those participants having active treatment showed an increase in the threshold dose for the conjunctival allergen provocation test (SMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.69; P = 0.05; I 2  = 43%). No significant reduction was observed in ocular eye drops use (SMD ‐0.10; 95% CI ‐0.22 to 0.03; P = 0.13; I 2  = 34%). Authors' conclusions Overall, SLIT is moderately effective in reducing total and individual ocular symptom scores in participants with ARC and AC. There were however some concerns about the overall quality of the evidence‐base, this relating to inadequate descriptions of allocation concealment in some studies, statistical heterogeneity and the possibility of publication bias. There is a need for further large rigorously designed studies that study long‐term effectiveness after discontinuation of treatment and establish the cost‐effectiveness of SLIT. Plain language summary Sublingual immunotherapy (tablets, spray or drops under the tongue) to treat inflammation of the conjunctiva due to allergy Conjunctivitis means inflammation of the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is the thin 'skin' that covers the white part of the eyes and the inside of the eyelids. Allergic conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva due to allergy. The most common cause is an allergy to pollen during the hay fever season. Symptoms include red eyes, itching, increased tearing and swelling of the conjunctiva and eyelids. If allergic conjunctivitis is combined with nasal allergy, the condition is termed allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. When medications do not provide enough relief another option is immunotherapy, which builds immunity to the allergen causing the reaction. Immunotherapy can be given under the tongue, nasally or by injection. This review included 42 trials with a total of 3958 participants with allergic conjunctivitis; 2011 who had sublingual immunotherapy and 1947 who had placebo. This review found that sublingual immunotherapy (that is, administered under the tongue) can reduce symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Pollen; Administration, Sublingual; Allergens [*administration & dosage]; Conjunctivitis, Allergic [immunology, *therapy]; Humans; Immunotherapy [*methods]; Plant Extracts [*administration & dosage, immunology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhinitis [complications, therapy]",10.1002/14651858.CD007685.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007685.pub2,Eyes and Vision
CD009238.PUB2,"Croft, AM; Bager, P; Garg, SK",Helminth therapy (worms) for allergic rhinitis,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2012,"Abstract - Background Allergic rhinitis is a disorder of the nasal membranes and surrounding tissues, and a worldwide cause of illness and disability. Helminths are complex tissue‐dwelling or lumen‐dwelling organisms that inhabit larger organisms and are frequently asymptomatic. Helminths modulate the natural immune responses of their human hosts, and may prevent or cure immune‐mediated or allergic diseases (e.g. allergic rhinitis) in the host. Non‐randomised studies support this hypothesis. Objectives To assess the safety and effectiveness of helminth therapy in people with allergic rhinitis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 24 June 2011. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials where the intervention was any helminth species or combination of helminth species, administered to people with allergic rhinitis in any dose, by any route and for any duration of exposure. We accepted both intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis patients. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data and assessed eligibility and risk of bias using a standardised data collection form. We resolved any disagreement through discussion. We combined dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using mean difference (MD), presenting both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We found five reports of two single‐centre, placebo‐controlled, double‐blinded studies (130 participants). Participants in both studies were a mix of adults with either intermittent or persistent allergic rhinitis. Both studies had a low risk of bias. One study, with 12 weeks’ follow‐up, used a single percutaneous application of 10  Necator americanus  (i.e. human hookworm) larvae. The other study, with 24 weeks’ follow‐up, used three‐weekly oral dosing with 2500  Trichuris suis  (i.e. pig whipworm) eggs in aqueous suspension. Of 17 outcomes evaluated in this review, eight were positive (i.e. favoured helminths). Participants taking helminths had no reduction in allergic rhinitis symptoms, percentage of well days (i.e. days with minimal symptoms and no use of medication for allergic rhinitis), lung function measures and quality of life scores. Total use of medication for allergic rhinitis (eye drops, nasal sprays, tablets) did not change; however, in the helminth group there was a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of days during the grass pollen season when participants needed to take tablets as rescue medication for their allergic rhinitis symptoms (MD –14.0%, 95% CI –26.6 to –1.40); in a typical 60‐day pollen season this 14% reduction translates into 19 days when tablets would be needed in the helminth group versus 27 days when tablets would be needed in the placebo group. Participants taking helminths percutaneously (i.e. as hookworm larvae) had local skin itching and redness in the first few days after administration. Participants taking helminths were more likely to report any gastrointestinal adverse event (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.45), moderate or severe abdominal pain (RR 7.67, 95% CI 1.87 to 31.57), moderate or severe flatulence (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.81) and moderate or severe diarrhoea (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.37). There was no difference between the helminth and placebo groups in the incidence of serious adverse events, and in study withdrawals. Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient evidence on the efficacy, tolerability and likely costs of helminth therapy to support its use in the routine management of allergic rhinitis. Administered to humans in carefully measured doses, helminths appear to be safe. More preclinical studies should be performed, before larger and extended duration trials of helminths for allergic rhinitis are carried out. Future studies should collect and report comparative data on the costs of helminth therapy versus conventional pharmacotherapy. Plain language summary Helminth therapy (worms) for allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is a common health problem affecting about 500 million people worldwide; its prevalence is increasing. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis include sneezing, and an itchy, runny and blocked nose. Several classes of drugs are used to treat allergic rhinitis, but these drugs may be ineffective, and some drug classes have side effects after long‐term use. Drugs may also be relatively expensive. Helminths are complex multicellular organisms that inhabit larger organisms, and in humans are often symptomless. Helminths modulate (that is, optimally adjust) the immune systems of their hosts and it is thought that this property of helminths could be used therapeutically, to prevent or treat allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis. We included two well‐designed studies with a total of 130 adult participants, each study using a different species of gastrointestinal helminth (human hookworm in one study and pig whipworm in the other) as the intervention. Both studies found no significant efficacy from helminths, although one helminth species ( Trichuris suis , the pig whipworm) reduced the need for participants to take tablets as ‘rescue medication’ during the grass pollen season. Adverse events such as abdominal pain and flatulence were commoner in the helminth group, but the two helminths species studied did not cause serious adverse reactions. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support the use of helminths for allergic rhinitis in routine clinical practice. More preclinical studies are needed, before larger and extended duration clinical trials of helminths for allergic rhinitis are performed.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adult; Ancylostomatoidea [immunology]; Animals; Helminths [*immunology]; Humans; Immunotherapy [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial [immunology, *therapy]; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal [immunology, *therapy]; Trichuris [*immunology]",10.1002/14651858.CD009238.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009238.pub2,ENT

Pretransfusion medication with anti‐inflammatory drugs is used in NHTR prevention, however its efficacy and safety remains unclear. Objectives To assess the clinical effects and safety of pharmacological interventions for preventing NHTR in patients with and without a history of transfusion reactions. Search methods The search strategy included The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 4, 2008), Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (December 17, 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to November (week 3) 2008), EMBASE (1988 to November (week 3) 2008), LILACS (1982 to January 12, 2009), CINAHL (1982 to December 2008), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED): 1970 to December 2008). There was no language restriction. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of interventions for the prevention of NHTR. Data collection and analysis Authors independently selected studies, assessed the risks of bias and extracted data. Relative risks (RR) were estimated in RCTs with parallel design (PD). Odds ratio (OR) was estimated for one RCT with crossover design (CD). No meta‐analysis was attempted due to differences in the pharmacotherapy of pre‐transfusion medication and methodology between the studies; a per‐protocol analysis was used. Main results This review includes three RCTs (two PD and one CD). The PD‐RCTs employed disparate units of randomisation (UofR); patient or transfusion, while the CD‐RCT applied the patient as the UofR. The PD‐RCTs administered leukodepleted blood products. Both PD‐RCTs compared acetaminophen plus diphenhydramine (ApD) at different regimens with placebo, while the CD‐RCT contrasted hydrocortisone pharmacotherapy with diphenhydramine. Both PD‐RCTs found no statistically significant difference in allergic reactions (RR 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.39, RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.73) and febrile reactions (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.26). The CD‐RCT found a statistically significant difference in the odds of febrile reactions (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.27). The trials did not report anaphylactic reactions, deaths related to transfusion reactions or other adverse events. Authors' conclusions None of the three studies found that medication prior to transfusion reduces NHTR. This applied regardless of the patient's history of NHTR and the use of leukodepleted blood products in the transfusion. However, this conclusion is based on three trials of moderate to low quality. A better‐powered RCT is necessary to evaluate the role of pretransfusion medication in the prevention of NHTR. Inclusion criteria should be restricted to patients at high risk of developing NHTR, with no restriction by age, history of transfusion reactions and type of blood products (leukodepleted or not). Plain language summary Pre‐transfusion drugs for preventing side effects from blood transfusions Febrile non‐haemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) and allergic reactions are the most common adverse reactions to blood transfusion. These reactions are often related to other dangerous side effects from transfusion such as sepsis due to contaminated blood products and intravascular red cell haemolysis. In an effort to prevent these reactions, patients are given drugs prior to transfusion. Three kinds of drugs are commonly used for this pre‐transfusion medication, either alone or in combination. However, this practice is not standardised and there is controversy about its effectiveness. This review found that current evidence from three trials in which 462 patients were analysed indicates pre‐transfusion medication in any regimen does not reduce the risk of allergic and febrile non‐haemolytic transfusion reactions.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Premedication; *Transfusion Reaction; Acetaminophen [administration & dosage]; Anti‐Inflammatory Agents, Non‐Steroidal [*administration & dosage]; Diphenhydramine [administration & dosage]; Fever [etiology, *prevention & control]; Histamine H1 Antagonists [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Hydrocortisone [administration & dosage]; Hypersensitivity [etiology, *prevention & control]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD007539.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007539.pub2,Injuries

Anaphylaxis guidelines recommend glucocorticoids for the treatment of people experiencing anaphylaxis.  Objectives We sought to assess the benefits and harms of glucocorticoid treatment during episodes of anaphylaxis.

In this version we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1956 to September 2011), EMBASE (Ovid) (1982 to September 2011), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (to September 2011). We also searched the UK National Research Register and websites listing ongoing trials, and contacted international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material.

Plain language summary Glucocorticoids for the treatment of anaphylaxis   Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may result in death. It is commonly triggered by a food, insect sting, medication, or natural rubber latex. The reaction typically occurs without warning and can be a frightening experience both for those at risk and their families and friends. Steroids (glucocorticoids) are often recommended for use in the management of people experiencing anaphylaxis. However, the evidence base in support of the use of steroids is unclear. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature, searching key databases for high quality published and unpublished material on the use of steroids for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis. In addition, we contacted experts in this health area and the relevant pharmaceutical companies. We were unable to find any randomized controlled trials on this subject through our searches. We conclude that there is no evidence from high quality studies for the use of steroids in the emergency management of anaphylaxis.

Search methods We searched the following databases up to June 2014: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and PsycINFO (from 1806). We searched five trials registers and checked articles for references to relevant randomised controlled trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of H1‐antihistamines for CSU. Interventions included single therapy or a combination of H1‐antihistamines compared with no treatment (placebo) or another active pharmacological compound at any dose. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome measures were proportion of participants with complete suppression of urticaria: 'good or excellent' response, 50% or greater improvement in quality of life measures, and adverse events. We present risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results We identified 73 studies (9759 participants); 34 studies provided data for 23 comparisons. The duration of the intervention was up to two weeks (short‐term) or longer than two weeks and up to three months (intermediate‐term). Cetirizine 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term led to complete suppression of urticaria by more participants than was seen with placebo (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.91). For this same outcome, comparison of desloratadine versus placebo in the intermediate term (5 mg) (RR 37.00, 95% CI 2.31 to 593.70) and in the short term (20 mg) (RR 15.97, 95% CI 1.04 to 245.04) favoured desloratadine, but no differences were seen between 5 mg and 10 mg for short‐term treatment. Levocetirizine 20 mg per day (short‐term) was more effective for complete suppression of urticaria compared with placebo (RR 20.87, 95% CI 1.37 to 317.60), and at 5 mg was effective in the intermediate term (RR 52.88, 95% CI 3.31 to 843.81) but not in the short term, nor was 10 mg effective in the short term. Rupatadine at 10 mg and 20 mg in the intermediate term achieved a 'good or excellent response' compared with placebo (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77). Loratadine (10 mg) versus placebo (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.79) and loratadine (10 mg) versus cetirizine (10 mg) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.43) over short‐term and intermediate‐term treatment showed no significant difference for 'good or excellent response' or for complete suppression of urticaria, respectively. Loratadine (10 mg) versus desloratadine (5 mg) (intermediate‐term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71). For loratadine (10 mg) versus mizolastine (10 mg) (intermediate‐term), no statistically significant difference was seen for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.42). Loratadine (10 mg) versus emedastine (2 mg) (intermediate‐term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.39) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24); the quality of the evidence was moderate for this comparison. No difference in short‐term treatment was noted between loratadine (10 mg) and hydroxyzine (25 mg) in terms of complete suppression (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10). When desloratadine (5 to 20 mg) was compared with levocetirizine (5 to 20 mg), levocetirizine appeared to be the more effective (P value < 0.02). In a comparison of fexofenadine versus cetirizine, more participants in the cetirizine group showed complete suppression of urticaria (P value < 0.001). Adverse events leading to withdrawals were not significantly different in the following comparisons: cetirizine versus placebo at 10 mg and 20 mg (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 13.22); desloratadine 5 mg versus placebo (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.10); loratadine 10 mg versus mizolastine 10 mg (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.60); loratadine 10 mg versus emedastine 2 mg (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.14); cetirizine 10 mg versus hydroxyzine 25 mg (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.45); and hydroxyzine 25 mg versus placebo (RR 3.64, 95% CI 0.77 to 17.23), all intermediate term. No difference was seen between loratadine 10 mg versus mizolastine 10 mg in the proportion of participants with at least 50% improvement in quality of life (RR 3.21, 95% CI 0.32 to 32.33). Authors' conclusions Although the results of our review indicate that at standard doses of treatment, several antihistamines are effective when compared with placebo, all results were gathered from a few studies or, in some cases, from single‐study estimates. The quality of the evidence was affected by the small number of studies in each comparison and the small sample size for many of the outcomes, prompting us to downgrade the quality of evidence for imprecision (unless stated for each comparison, the quality of the evidence was low). No single H1‐antihistamine stands out as most effective. Cetirizine at 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term was found to be effective in completely suppressing urticaria. Evidence is limited for desloratadine given at 5 mg once daily in the intermediate term and at 20 mg in the short term. Levocetirizine at 5 mg in the intermediate but not short term was effective for complete suppression. Levocetirizine 20 mg was effective in the short term, but 10 mg was not. No difference in rates of withdrawal due to adverse events was noted between active and placebo groups. Evidence for improvement in quality of life was insufficient. Plain language summary H1‐antihistamines for chronic spontaneous urticaria Background Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a condition characterised by a rash of red itchy raised weals or hives, which appear for no identifiable reason. Other names include chronic idiopathic or chronic ordinary urticaria. 'Spontaneous' differentiates this type of urticaria from 'inducible' or 'physical' urticaria, for which there are specific triggers such as cold or pressure. 'Chronic' indicates that the condition has continued for at least six weeks. Hives may be intensely itchy, and the appearance may be unsightly and distressing to sufferers. In some cases, hives can be accompanied by deeper swelling, known as angio‐oedema, which is most common around the eyes and mouth. Antihistamine drugs, specifically H1 antihistamines, are the mainstay of treatment for urticaria, although they control the condition rather than cure it. Many antihistamines are available to buy without a prescription, including brand names such as Clarityn, Piriton, Zirtek, Benadryl and Phenergan (brand names may differ by country). Review question Which H1‐antihistamines are effective and safe for CSU? Study characteristics We included 73 randomised controlled trials, with 9759 participants of all ages and looked for complete suppression of urticaria. The duration of the intervention was up to two weeks (short‐term) or longer than two weeks and up to three months (intermediate‐term). Key results We investigated clinical trials in which one therapy was compared against another or against placebo (direct comparisons). We found that for general use, 10 mg once daily of cetirizine for short‐term and intermediate‐term duration was effective in completely suppressing urticaria, although not in all individuals. Some benefit may be associated with use of desloratadine at 5 mg for at least an intermediate term and at 20 mg in the short term. Levocetirizine at 5 mg was effective for complete suppression in the intermediate term but not in the short term. A higher dose of 20 mg was effective in the short term, but 10 mg was not. Adverse events, such as headache or dry mouth, are tolerable with most antihistamines. Evidence is less clear for improvement in quality of life (e.g. reduction in sleep disturbance from itching, less distress from the appearance of hives) as many studies did not address this. We cannot say whether one antihistamine works better than all the rest, as we did not have head‐to‐head evidence for every possible treatment comparison. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence found for most outcomes was low. Further well‐designed and carefully reported comparative studies are required, if we are to find out how well these medicines work, and if any adverse effects are reported, especially over periods of up to several months.",11,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Cetirizine [therapeutic use]; Cyproheptadine [analogs & derivatives, therapeutic use]; Histamine H1 Antagonists [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Humans; Hydroxyzine [therapeutic use]; Loratadine [analogs & derivatives, therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Urticaria [*drug therapy]",10.1002/14651858.CD006137.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006137.pub2,Skin

H1‐antihistamines are commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of anaphylaxis. Objectives To assess the benefits and harm of H1‐antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis. Search methods In our previous version we searched until June 2006. In this version we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ( The Cochrane Library  2010 ,  Issue 11), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2010); EMBASE (1966 to November 2010); CINAHL (1982 to Nobember 2010) and ISI Web of Science (1945 to November 2010). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material. Selection criteria We planned to include randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing H1‐antihistamines with placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion. Main results We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Based on this review, we are unable to make any recommendations for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials are needed, although these are likely to prove challenging to design and execute. Plain language summary H1‐antihistamines for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a rare, but potentially life‐threatening emergency. Evidence from the United Kingdom suggests that incidence may be increasing rapidly. Common triggers of anaphylaxis include a variety of foods, drugs and insect venoms. H1‐antihistamines are commonly used for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis although the evidence underpinning this treatment is unclear. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature searching key databases for high quality published and unpublished material on this subject; in addition, we contacted experts in this area and relevant pharmaceutical companies. Our searches failed to retrieve any randomized controlled trials on this subject. We conclude there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support the use of H1‐antihistamines in the emergency management of anaphylaxis.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,Anaphylaxis [*drug therapy]; Emergency Treatment; Histamine H1 Antagonists [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Shock [*complications],10.1002/14651858.CD006160.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006160.pub2,Emergency and Critical Care

Elimination of the allergen is the principle treatment for food allergy, including allergy to fruit. Accidental ingestion of allergenic foods can result in severe anaphylactic reactions. Allergen‐specific immunotherapy (SIT) is a specific treatment, when the avoidance of allergenic foods is problematic. Recently, studies have been conducted on different types of immunotherapy for the treatment of food allergy, including oral (OIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of oral and sublingual immunotherapy in children and adults with food allergy to fruits, when compared with placebo or an elimination strategy. Search methods The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and AMED were searched for published results along with trial registries and the Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine for grey literature. The date of the most recent search was July 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OIT or SLIT with placebo or an elimination diet were included. Participants were children or adults diagnosed with food allergy who presented immediate fruit reactions. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We assessed treatment effect through risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. Main results We identified two RCTs (N=89) eligible for inclusion. These RCTs addressed oral or sublingual immunotherapy, both in adults, with an allergy to apple or peach respectively. Both studies enrolled a small number of participants and used different methods to provide these differing types of immunotherapy. Both studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, the quality of evidence was judged to be very low due to the small number of studies and participants and possible bias. The studies were clinically heterogeneous and hence we did not pool the results. A study comparing SLIT with placebo for allergy to peach did not detect a significant difference between the number of patients desensitised at six months following a double‐blind placebo‐controlled food challenge (RR 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 2.74). The second study, comparing OIT versus no treatment for apple allergy, found an effect on desensitisation in favour of the intervention using an oral provocation test at eight months, but results were imprecise (RR 17.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 270.19). Neither study reported data on evidence of immunologic tolerance. In both studies, the incidence of mild and moderate adverse events was higher in the intervention groups than in the controls. In the study comparing SLIT with placebo, patients in the intervention group experienced significantly more local adverse reactions than participants in the control group (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.51 to 6.82), though there was not a significant difference in the number of participants experiencing systemic adverse reactions (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.02). In the study of OIT, two of the 25 participants in the intervention group reported relevant side effects, whereas no participants in the control group reported relevant side effects. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence for using OIT or SLIT to treat allergy to fruit, specifically related to peach and apple. Mild or moderate adverse reactions were reported more frequently in people receiving OIT or SLIT. However, these reactions could be treated successfully with medications. Plain language summary Oral and sublingual immunotherapy (giving people small amounts of things they are allergic to via their mouth or under their tongue) for fruit allergy Review question and background We reviewed the evidence about the effect of oral and sublingual immunotherapy in people with a food allergy to fruit. Food allergy is an abnormal response to a food, usually after eating it. The main treatment for food allergy is to avoid the food, but in people with food allergy, accidentally eating the food can cause severe reactions. Immunotherapy is a possible long‐term treatment for food allergy, including for food allergy to fruit. Immunotherapy is a process where increasing doses of the thing someone is allergic to (the allergen) are given over a period of time to help the person be less sensitive to the allergen. In oral immunotherapy, a small amount of the allergen is given to someone to eat. In sublingual immunotherapy, an extract from the allergen is put under the tongue. Study characteristics We found two studies with 89 participants in total. One looked at oral immunotherapy in people with an allergy to apple, comparing it to no treatment, and one looked at sublingual immunotherapy in people with an allergy to peach, comparing it to a placebo. Both studies were in adults. The evidence is current to July 2015. Key results The study of oral immunotherapy for apple allergy found participants who received the intervention were less sensitive to apple than people who did not receive the intervention at eight months. The study of sublingual immunotherapy for peach allergy did not find a difference between the groups in terms of sensitivity at six months. In both studies, there were more side effects in people receiving the treatment, but these were not serious. Overall, the quality of evidence is very low because both studies were small, results were not similar between studies, and there were issues with study design. More research is needed before we can tell if oral and sublingual therapy works for food allergy to fruits.",11,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adult; Desensitization, Immunologic [*methods]; Food Hypersensitivity [etiology, *therapy]; Fruit [*adverse effects]; Humans; Malus [*adverse effects]; Pyrus [*adverse effects]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sublingual Immunotherapy [methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD010522.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010522.pub2,Tobacco Addiction
CD001815.PUB2,"Ng, E; Shah, VS",Erythromycin for the prevention and treatment of feeding intolerance in preterm infants,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2008,"Abstract - Background Functional immaturity of gastrointestinal motility predisposes preterm infants to feeding intolerance. Erythromycin is a motilin agonist that exerts its prokinetic effect by stimulating propagative contractile activity in the interdigestive phase. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of erythromycin in the prevention and treatment of feeding intolerance in preterm infants. Search methods Systematic literature search was performed according to the Cochrane Neonatal Collaborative Review Group search strategy. Randomized controlled trials of erythromycin in preterm infants to promote gastrointestinal motility were identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 ‐ December 2007), EMBASE (1980 ‐ December 2007), CINAHL (1982 ‐ December 2007), cross‐references, abstracts, and journal hand searching. Selection criteria The initial selection criteria limited the review to studies using erythromycin at 3 ‐ 12 mg/kg/day in preterm infants less than 36 weeks gestational age with feeding tolerance. However, a significant number of studies using erythromycin at a higher dose (> 12 mg/kg/day) or as prophylaxis for those at risk of feeding intolerance were identified. A  post hoc  decision was made to include these studies in the review. Data collection and analysis Studies were categorized into prevention and treatment studies, and data from each category were analyzed separately. Within each category, subgroup analyses were performed based on low (3 to 12mg/kg/day) and high doses (> 12mg/kg/day) of erythromycin. Primary outcome was days to full enteral feeding. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects associated with erythromycin, duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), weight gain, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and length of hospital stay. Main results Ten randomized controlled studies (three prevention and seven treatment studies) were included. Studies varied greatly in the definition of feeding intolerance and how outcomes were measured, analyzed and reported, so meta‐analysis of most outcomes was impossible. It was observed, however, that the studies using erythromycin at higher treatment doses (40 to 50 mg/kg/day) or in infants > 32 weeks' GA reported more positive effects in improving feeding intolerance. Meta‐analysis of high dose prevention studies showed no significant difference in NEC (typical RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.11, 3.01; typical RD ‐0.021, 95% CI ‐0.087, 0.045). Meta‐analysis of high dose treatment studies showed no significant difference in septicemia (typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47, 1.45; typical RD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.17, 0.08). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of erythromycin in low or high doses for preterm infants with or at risk of feeding intolerance. Future research is needed to determine if there is a more precise dose range where erythromycin might be effective as a prokinetic agent in preterm infants > 32 weeks' GA. Plain language summary Erythromycin for preventing and treating preterm infants with feeding difficulties There is not enough evidence to show any benefit from erythromycin used in large or small doses for the prevention or treatment of feeding problems in premature infants. Premature infants who need intensive care often have feeding problems. Frequently, some food stays in the stomach without being digested. Earlier feeding can facilitate normal development of the gastrointestinal tract and can avoid health problems related to feeding by intravenous lines. Erythromycin is an antibiotic that has an effect on the gastrointestinal tract and may help infants with feeding problems. However, this review found that there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of erythromycin in small or large doses to prevent or treat premature infants with feeding problems.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Gastrointestinal Motility; Erythromycin [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Gastrointestinal Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Gastrointestinal Diseases [*drug therapy]; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infant, Premature, Diseases [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD001815.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001815.pub2,Neonatal
CD010085.PUB2,"Gunaratne, AW; Makrides, M; Collins, CT",Maternal prenatal and/or postnatal n‐3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation for preventing allergies in early childhood,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2015,"Abstract - Background Allergies have become more prevalent globally over the last 20 years. Dietary consumption of n‐3 (or omega 3) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) has declined over the same period of time. This, together with the known role of n‐3 LCPUFA in inhibiting inflammation, has resulted in speculation that n‐3 LCPUFA may prevent allergy development. Dietary n‐3 fatty acids supplements may change the developing immune system of the newborn before allergic responses are established, particularly for those with a genetic predisposition to the production of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody. Individuals with IgE‐mediated allergies have both the signs and symptoms of the allergic disease and a positive skin prick test (SPT) to the allergen. Objectives To assess the effect of n‐3 LCPUFA supplementation in pregnant and/or breastfeeding women on allergy outcomes (food allergy, atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma/wheeze) in their children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (6 August 2014), PubMed (1966 to 01 August 2014), CINAHL via EBSCOhost (1984 to 01 August 2014), Scopus (1995 to 01 August 2014), Web of Knowledge (1864 to 01 August 2014) and  ClinicalTrials.gov  (01 August 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of n‐3 LCPUFA supplementation of pregnant and/or lactating women (compared with placebo or no treatment) on allergy outcomes of the infants or children. Trials using a cross‐over design and trials examining biochemical outcomes only were not eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and performed data extraction. Where the review authors were also investigators on trials selected, an independent reviewer assessed trial quality and performed data extraction. Main results Eight trials involving 3366 women and their 3175 children were included in the review. In these trials, women were supplemented with n‐3 LCPUFA during pregnancy (five trials), lactation (two trials) or both pregnancy and lactation (one trial). All trials randomly allocated women to either a n‐3 LCPUFA supplement or a control group. The risk of bias varied across the eight included trials in this review with only two trials with a low risk of selection, performance and attrition bias. N‐3 LCPUFA supplementation showed a clear reduction in the primary outcome of any allergy (medically diagnosed IgE mediated) in children aged 12 to 36 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.98; two RCTs; 823 children), but not beyond 36 months (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.20; one RCT, 706 children). For any allergy (medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report), no clear differences were seen in children either at 12 to 36 months (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; two RCTs, 823 children) or beyond 36 months of age (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; three RCTs, 1765 children). For the secondary outcomes of specific allergies there were no clear differences for food allergies at 12 to 36 months and beyond 36 months, but a clear reduction was seen for children in their first 12 months with n‐3 LCPUFA (both for medically diagnosed IgE mediated and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report). There was a clear reduction in medically diagnosed IgE‐mediated eczema with n‐3 LCPUFA for children 12 to 36 months of age, but not at any other time point for both medically diagnosed IgE mediated and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report. No clear differences for allergic rhinitis or asthma/wheeze were seen at any time point for both medically diagnosed IgE mediated, and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report. There was a clear reduction in children's sensitisation to egg and sensitisation to any allergen between 12 to 36 months of age when mothers were supplemented with n‐3 LCPUFA. In terms of safety for the mother and child, n‐3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy did not show increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage or early childhood infections. Authors' conclusions Overall, there is limited evidence to support maternal n‐3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy and/or lactation for reducing allergic disease in children. Few differences in childhood allergic disease were seen between women who were supplemented with n‐3 LCPUFA and those who were not. Plain language summary Fish oil (n‐3 or omega‐3) for pregnant mothers or breastfeeding mothers to prevent allergies in their young children Fish and fish oil are the major sources of omega‐3 long chain fatty acids. Dietary marine omega‐3 fatty acid supplements during pregnancy may change the immune system of the newborn before allergic responses are established, particularly for those with a genetic predisposition to the production of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody. Individuals with IgE‐mediated allergies have both the signs and symptoms of the allergic disease and a positive skin prick test (SPT) to the allergen. Allergy is an important public health problem that places a burden on individuals, society and healthcare costs. Allergic diseases include food allergies, eczema (atopic dermatitis), asthma or wheeze and hay fever (allergic rhinitis). Many childhood allergies continue into adulthood. Pregnant women, especially those from Western countries, are not eating as much fish and allergic diseases have been increasing over the time that pregnant women have been eating less fish. The unborn baby gets nutrition from his or her mother and so the mother's diet is important. Supplementing women with omega‐3 fatty acids from marine origin may be important in preventing their children from developing allergies. In this review of randomised controlled studies, we evaluated the effects of adding marine omega‐3 fatty acids to women’s diets during pregnancy or lactation on allergic diseases in their children. We analysed eight trials that involved 3366 women and 3175 children. The women were randomly assigned to receive a marine omega‐3 supplement (as fish oil capsules, or added to foods) or no treatment during pregnancy (five trials), during breast feeding (two trials) or both pregnancy and breast feeding (one trial). Overall, the methodological quality of the trials varied, with only two trials being at low risk of bias. Overall, the results showed little effect of maternal marine omega‐3 supplementation during pregnancy and/or breast feeding for the reduction of allergic disease in the children. However there were reductions in some outcomes such as food allergy during the baby's first year and eczema with marine omega‐3 supplementation in women with a baby at high risk of allergy. Currently, there is not enough evidence to say that omega‐3 supplements from marine origin during pregnancy and/or breast feeding for mothers will reduce allergies in their children. In terms of safety for the mother and child, omega‐3 fatty acids supplementation from marine origin during pregnancy did not show increased risk of excessive bleeding after the baby was born (postpartum haemorrhage) or early childhood infections.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Dietary Supplements; Age Factors; Child, Preschool; Fatty Acids, Omega‐3 [*administration & dosage]; Female; Food Hypersensitivity [prevention & control]; Humans; Hypersensitivity [*prevention & control]; Immunoglobulin E [immunology]; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Postnatal Care; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD010085.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010085.pub2,Pregnancy and Childbirth
CD005235.PUB2,"Jose, J; Coatesworth, AP",Inferior turbinate surgery for nasal obstruction in allergic rhinitis after failed medical treatment,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2010,"Abstract - Background Allergic rhinitis is a highly prevalent disease that results from an IgE‐mediated hypersensitivity reaction of the nasal mucosa to inhaled allergens. It is primarily treated by allergen avoidance and medical treatment, but when these measures fail to control symptoms then surgery to the inferior turbinates of nose is often performed. It is unclear whether these procedures are beneficial in the long term or indeed whether the risks outweigh the benefits. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of inferior turbinate surgery on unrelieved or partially relieved nasal obstruction in patients after maximal medical treatment of proven allergic rhinitis, to compare the results using different surgical techniques and to measure short and long‐term results. Search methods We searched the following databases from their inception for published, unpublished and ongoing trials: the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 2); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; CAB Abstracts; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; CNKI;  m RCT (Current Controlled Trials); ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN; ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform); Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; Google and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. We modelled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for CENTRAL. The date of the most recent search was 6 July 2010. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of inferior turbinate surgery versus continued medical treatment for proven allergic rhinitis, or comparisons between one technique of inferior turbinate surgery versus another technique, after maximal medical treatment. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently screened the search results and assessed the full text of potentially relevant studies. We attempted to contact trial authors for additional information. Main results There were no studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the need for randomised controlled trials to evaluate the role of inferior turbinate surgery for nasal obstruction in allergic rhinitis after failed medical treatment. Future trials needs to be rigorous in design and delivery, separate adults from paediatric patients, not combine allergic with non‐allergic patients and last long enough to determine long‐term results and complications. Plain language summary Surgery to the inferior turbinate (lining of the nose) in order to relieve nose block in allergic rhinitis after failed medical treatment Inferior turbinate (lining of nose) surgery is a commonly performed procedure in ENT as shrinking the lining may reduce some of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, particularly nose blockage. This procedure is carried out using a multitude of techniques including cautery, laser and plasma knife. Although unusual, there is the potential for complications such as excessive bleeding and dry nose from these procedures. We set out to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of inferior turbinate surgery compared to continued medical treatment in allergic rhinitis patients in whom medical treatment had failed to relieve symptoms. We also looked for RCTs comparing one technique of turbinate surgery with another. Although our search was extensive, we were not able to find any RCTs which met our inclusion criteria. Research, in the form of properly conducted trials comparing various techniques and assessing long‐term results and complications, has not yet been done in this field. We therefore conclude that the evidence in the literature is not robust enough about the usefulness of surgery using any technique for this condition.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Humans; Nasal Obstruction [*surgery]; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial [*complications]; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal [*complications]; Treatment Failure; Turbinates [*surgery]",10.1002/14651858.CD005235.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005235.pub2,ENT
CD008596.PUB2,"Fedorowicz, Z; van Zuuren, EJ; Hu, N",Histamine H2‐receptor antagonists for urticaria,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2012,"Abstract - Background Urticaria is a common skin disease characterised by itching weals or hives, which can occur almost anywhere on the body. There are a number of different subtypes and a range of available treatment options. There is lack of agreement on the efficacy of H2‐receptor antagonists used in the treatment of urticaria. Objectives To assess the safety and effectiveness of H2‐receptor antagonists in the treatment of urticaria. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 7 October 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library  (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of H2‐receptor antagonists in people with a clinical diagnosis of urticaria of any duration or of any subtype. Studies including H1‐antihistamines for chronic urticaria are the topic of a separate Cochrane review; thus, they were not included in this review. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted and analysed data. Main results Four studies of a relatively small size, involving 144 participants, were included in this review. A combination of ranitidine with diphenhydramine was more effective at improving the resolution of urticaria than diphenhydramine administered alone (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.36). Although there was a similar improvement in itching, weal size, and intensity, cimetidine provided no statistically significant greater overall improvement in symptoms of urticaria when compared to diphenhydramine. However, a combination of these medications was more effective than diphenhydramine alone (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.94). Adverse events were reported with several of the interventions, i.e. ranitidine and diphenhydramine, causing drowsiness and sedation, but there was no significant difference in the level of sedation from baseline with either famotidine or diphenhydramine. Authors' conclusions The very limited evidence provided by this review was based on a few old studies of a relatively small size, which we categorised as having high to unclear risk of bias. Thus, at present, the review does not allow confident decision‐making about the use of H2‐receptor antagonists for urticaria. Although some of these studies have reported a measure of relief of symptoms of urticaria and rather minimal clinical improvement in some of the participants, the evidence was weak and unreliable. We have emphasised the lack of precision and limitations in the reported data where appropriate in this review. Plain language summary Histamine‐blocking drugs for hives Urticaria is a common skin disease characterised by itching weals or hives that can appear anywhere on the surface of the skin. Weals may be pinpoint in size or several inches in diameter. Most sufferers experience hives continuously or intermittently for less than six weeks, but they may last longer (when they are then called 'chronic'). Urticaria can also be accompanied by angioedema (swelling of a deeper layer of the skin). There are several varieties of urticaria, but the most common forms are acute urticaria and chronic urticaria. Common causes of acute urticaria are infections and adverse reactions to medications and foods, whereas in chronic urticaria the cause is often unknown. Intense itching is common, and it can lead to disturbed sleep and even depression, having a serious impact on a person's quality of life. As the face and other exposed body parts can be affected, hives and angioedema can prove embarrassing for the individual. There are a range of treatment options for urticaria, of which the most well‐known are the H1‐antihistamines. This review evaluated the efficacy and safety of a similar category, the H2‐antihistamines, and included 4 low‐quality studies, which examined 144 participants. No firm conclusions could be drawn, but the combination of ranitidine with diphenhydramine appeared to be slightly more effective in reducing the symptoms of urticaria than diphenhydramine alone. In one study, cimetidine appeared to be as effective as diphenhydramine. However, the combination of both drugs was more effective than diphenhydramine alone. Drowsiness and sedation were reported with diphenhydramine, but there was no significant difference in the level of sedation with either famotidine or diphenhydramine. The studies were rather old and considered very few outcomes that were of importance to people with urticaria. Therefore, there is currently insufficient evidence to indicate whether this type of medication is effective or not.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Cimetidine [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Diphenhydramine [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Drug Therapy, Combination [methods]; Famotidine [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Histamine H2 Antagonists [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Ranitidine [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Urticaria [*drug therapy]",10.1002/14651858.CD008596.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008596.pub2,Skin

A high quality systematic review has not previously assessed the efficacy and safety of this treatment. Objectives To assess the effects of specific allergen immunotherapy (SIT), including subcutaneous, sublingual, intradermal, and oral routes, compared with placebo or a standard treatment in people with atopic eczema. Search methods We searched the following databases up to July 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 7, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), Web of Science™ (from 2005), the Global Resource of EczemA Trials (GREAT database), and five trials databases. We searched abstracts from recent European and North American allergy meetings and checked the references of included studies and review articles for further references to relevant trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of specific allergen immunotherapy that used standardised allergen extracts in people with AE. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction (including adverse effects), assessment of risk of bias, and analyses. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We identified 12 RCTs for inclusion in this review; the total number of participants was 733. The interventions included SIT in children and adults allergic to either house dust mite (10 trials), grass pollen, or other inhalant allergens (two trials). They were administered subcutaneously (six trials), sublingually (four trials), orally, or intradermally (two trials). Overall, the risk of bias was moderate, with high loss to follow up and lack of blinding as the main methodological concern. Our primary outcomes were 'Participant‐ or parent‐reported global assessment of disease severity at the end of treatment'; 'Participant‐ or parent‐reported specific symptoms of eczema, by subjective measures'; and 'Adverse events, such as acute episodes of asthma or anaphylaxis'. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) is a means of measuring the effect of atopic dermatitis by area (A); intensity (B); and subjective measures (C), such as itch and sleeplessness, which we used. For 'Participant‐ or parent‐reported global assessment of disease severity at the end of treatment', one trial (20 participants) found improvement in 7/9 participants (78%) treated with the SIT compared with 3/11 (27%) treated with the placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 7.96; P = 0.04). Another study (24 participants) found no difference: global disease severity improved in 8/13 participants (62%) treated with the SIT compared with 9/11 (81%) treated with the placebo (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.26; P = 0.38). We did not perform meta‐analysis because of high heterogeneity between these two studies. The quality of the evidence was low. For 'Participant‐ or parent‐reported specific symptoms of eczema, by subjective measures', two trials (184 participants) did not find that the SIT improved SCORAD part C (mean difference (MD) ‐0.74, 95% CI ‐1.98 to 0.50) or sleep disturbance (MD ‐0.49, 95% CI ‐1.03 to 0.06) more than placebo. For SCORAD part C itch severity, these two trials (184 participants) did not find that the SIT improved itch (MD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐1.00 to 0.52). One other non‐blinded study (60 participants) found that the SIT reduced itch compared with no treatment (MD ‐4.20, 95% CI ‐3.69 to ‐4.71) and reduced the participants' overall symptoms (P < 0.01), but we could not pool these three studies due to high heterogeneity. The quality of the evidence was very low. Seven trials reported systemic adverse reactions: 18/282 participants (6.4%) treated with the SIT had a systemic reaction compared with 15/210 (7.1%) with no treatment (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.49; the quality of the evidence was moderate). The same seven trials reported local adverse reactions: 90/280 participants (32.1%) treated with the SIT had a local reaction compared with 44/204 (21.6%) in the no treatment group (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.81). As these had the same study limitations, we deemed the quality of the evidence to also be moderate. Of our secondary outcomes, there was a significant improvement in 'Investigator‐ or physician‐rated global assessment of disease severity at the end of treatment' (six trials, 262 participants; RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.88). None of the studies reported our secondary outcome 'Parent‐ or participant‐rated eczema severity assessed using a published scale', but two studies (n = 184), which have been mentioned above, used SCORAD part C, which we included as our primary outcome 'Participant‐ or parent‐reported specific symptoms of eczema, by subjective measures'. Our findings were generally inconclusive because of the small number of studies. We were unable to determine by subgroup analyses a particular type of allergen or a particular age or level of disease severity where allergen immunotherapy was more successful. We were also unable to determine whether sublingual immunotherapy was associated with more local adverse reactions compared with subcutaneous immunotherapy. Authors' conclusions Overall, the quality of the evidence was low. The low quality was mainly due to the differing results between studies, lack of blinding in some studies, and relatively few studies reporting participant‐centred outcome measures. We found limited evidence that SIT may be an effective treatment for people with AE. The treatments used in these trials were not associated with an increased risk of local or systemic reactions. Future studies should use high quality allergen formulations with a proven track record in other allergic conditions and should include participant‐reported outcome measures. Plain language summary Specific allergy immunotherapy for the treatment of atopic eczema Background At least one in seven children and one in 50 adults suffer from atopic eczema, a skin condition characterised by an itchy red rash. People with atopic eczema are allergic to things in the environment, such as house dust mites, and exposure to what they are allergic to may make their eczema worse. Specific allergen immunotherapy is a treatment that involves a course of injections or drops under the tongue containing the substance to which a person is allergic. The treatment can reduce the severity of a person's allergy and may therefore be able to reduce symptoms of atopic eczema. We evaluated whether specific allergen immunotherapy was better or worse than a standard treatment or placebo at improving disease severity and symptoms as assessed by participants, parents, or investigators. Review question Is specific allergen immunotherapy an effective treatment for people with atopic eczema? Study characteristics The evidence is current to July 2015. We found 12 studies, with 733 participants, which included both children and adults. Studies were conducted in specialist allergy centres in nine countries. The duration of trials ranged from four months to three years. Immunotherapy was administered to the participants in four different ways. Allergen manufacturers funded seven of the 12 studies. Key results We found no evidence from the studies in our review that SIT may be an effective treatment for atopic eczema, as rated by participants or parents for disease severity and symptoms. We found limited evidence that SIT may improve investigator‐rated disease severity. Immunotherapy did not cause any more harm than a standard treatment or placebo. Quality of the evidence Overall, the quality of the evidence was low. We downgraded quality mainly due to the differing results between studies, lack of blinding in some studies, and that relatively few studies reported outcomes relevant to patients. Future studies should use high quality allergen formulations with a proven track record in other allergic conditions and should include participant‐reported outcome measures.",2,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adult; Allergens [*therapeutic use]; Animals; Child; Dermatitis, Atopic [*therapy]; Dermatophagoides farinae; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; Desensitization, Immunologic [*methods]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD008774.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008774.pub2,Skin

It is important to determine if dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) given as supplements or added to infant formula prevent the development of allergy. Objectives To determine the effect of higher PUFA intake during infancy to prevent allergic disease. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 14 September 2015) and CINAHL (1982 to 14 September 2015). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared the use of a PUFA with no PUFA in infants for the prevention of allergy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data from the included studies. We used fixed‐effect analyses. The treatment effects were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. Main results The search found 17 studies that assessed the effect of higher versus lower intake of PUFAs on allergic outcomes in infants. Only nine studies enrolling 2704 infants reported allergy outcomes that could be used in meta‐analyses. Of these, there were methodological concerns for eight. In infants up to two years of age, meta‐analyses found no difference in incidence of all allergy (1 study, 323 infants; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.26; risk difference (RD) ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.09; heterogeneity not applicable), asthma (3 studies, 1162 infants; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.35, I 2  = 0%; RD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.05, I 2  = 0%), dermatitis/eczema (7 studies, 1906 infants; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06, I 2  = 0%; RD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02, I 2  = 0%) or food allergy (3 studies, 915 infants; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.19, I 2  = 63%; RD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02, I 2  = 74%).

Authors' conclusions There is no evidence that PUFA supplementation in infancy has an effect on infant or childhood allergy, asthma, dermatitis/eczema or food allergy. However, the quality of evidence was very low. There was insufficient evidence to determine an effect on allergic rhinitis. Plain language summary Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in infancy for the prevention of allergy Review question In infants, does supplementation of the diet with oil high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) result in a decreased risk of developing allergies such as asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever (called allergic rhinitis) and food allergy in infancy and childhood? Background Allergy is responsible for a substantial health burden in infants, children and adults. Early dietary intakes may influence the development of allergic disease. Dietary PUFAs, such as fish oil, have a role in inflammatory conditions. It is important to determine if dietary PUFAs given as supplements or added to infant formula have the potential to prevent the development of allergy. PUFAs may be given to the breastfeeding mother, to the infant as a supplement (contents of a capsule) or added to infant formula. Study characteristics This review found 100 studies that assessed the effect of higher versus lower intake of PUFAs in infants through searches of medical databases up to September 2015. However, only nine of these studies enrolling 2704 infants reported allergy outcomes (measures). Of these nine studies, we considered only one to be high quality. Five studies reported all allergy as an outcome measure; four studies reported asthma; all nine studies reported dermatitis/eczema; two studies reported allergic rhinitis and four studies reported food allergy. Key results PUFA supplementation in infancy did not affect the risk of infant (aged up to two years of age) or childhood (aged up to 10 years of age) allergy, asthma, dermatitis/eczema and food allergy. There was a reduction in the risk of allergic rhinitis during infancy, however, there was no effect on the risk of childhood allergic rhinitis. There is insufficient evidence to determine an effect on allergic rhinitis. Quality of evidence We graded the evidence for no effect on infant incidence, childhood incidence and childhood prevalence of all allergy as very low; the reduction in infant incidence of allergic rhinitis as very low; and the evidence for no effect on infant incidence, childhood incidence and childhood prevalence of all other allergic outcomes as very low to low. Further high quality studies are needed before we can determine an effect of higher PUFA intake in infants on the risk of allergic disease.",10,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Dietary Supplements; Asthma [prevention & control]; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis [prevention & control]; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated [*administration & dosage]; Food Hypersensitivity [prevention & control]; Humans; Hypersensitivity [epidemiology, *prevention & control]; Infant; Prevalence; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rhinitis, Allergic [epidemiology, prevention & control]",10.1002/14651858.CD010112.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010112.pub2,Neonatal
CD004357.PUB4,"Zhou, Y; Yang, M; Dong, BR",Monosodium glutamate avoidance for chronic asthma in adults and children,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2012,"Abstract - Background Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the sodium salt of the non‐essential amino acid, glutamic acid, and is used as a flavour enhancer. It has been implicated in causing adverse reactions, which have been referred to as ""Chinese restaurant syndrome"". Over the last two decades there have been a number of studies investigating whether MSG ingestion induces an asthmatic response, and several reviews have been published ( ILSI 1991 ;  Stevenson 2000 ;  Woods 2001 ), but no meta‐analysis or Cochrane systematic review has been performed. Objectives The objectives of this review are to: 1) identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of MSG ingestion and asthma response in adults and children older than two years of age with asthma; 2) assess the methodological quality of these trials; and 3) determine the effect of MSG ingestion on asthma outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and bibliographies of existing trials. Searches were current up to May 2012. Selection criteria We included RCTs that investigated the effect of MSG on chronic asthma in adults and children. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted, entered and analysed data from included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results Only two cross‐over studies involving 24 adults met the eligibility criteria; the challenge dosages of MSG were 1 g, 5 g and 25 mg/kg. They reported the number of subjects who had a maximum fall in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1 ) greater than 15% or 200 mL after MSG or the control challenge. The pooled data found no statistically significant difference between MSG and placebo. One trial reported the mean change at four hours and maximum fall in FEV 1  over four hours after MSG or the placebo challenge, but found no statistically significant difference between interventions. There were no differences in symptom scores, non‐specific bronchial hyper‐responsiveness (BHR), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) or tryptase levels in peripheral blood between MSG and control, although we were unable to perform meta‐analyses. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence available (n = 24) found no significant difference between MSG or the control challenge for the number of subjects who had a maximum fall in FEV 1  greater than 15% or 200 mL. There is no evidence to support the avoidance of MSG in adults with chronic asthma, but as data were limited, this review cannot provide a reliable evidence base for determining whether MSG avoidance is a worthwhile strategy. We could not find any studies conducted on the effect of MSG in children with chronic asthma. There is therefore, a need for further RCTs to investigate any relationship between MSG and asthma, especially in children. Plain language summary Monosodium glutamate (MSG) avoidance for chronic asthma in adults and children Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is used as a flavour enhancer and has been implicated in ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"", causing tightness, burning or numbness in the face, neck and upper chest (although there is no evidence to prove this syndrome). It has also been proposed that asthmatics may react badly to MSG. In two randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 24 adult asthmatics, there was no evidence that MSG worsened asthma when compared to control ingestion.

CD009542.PUB2,"Yeung, JP; Kloda, LA; McDevitt, J; Ben‐Shoshan, M; Alizadehfar, R",Oral immunotherapy for milk allergy,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2012,"Abstract - Background The mainstay of treatment of IgE‐mediated cow milk allergy (IMCMA) is an avoidance diet, which is especially difficult with a ubiquitous food like milk. Milk oral immunotherapy (MOIT) may be an alternative treatment, through desensitization or induction of tolerance. Objectives We aim to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of MOIT in children and adults with IMCMA as compared to a placebo treatment or avoidance strategy. Search methods We searched 13 databases for journal articles, conference proceedings, theses and unpublished trials, without language or date restrictions, using a combination of subject headings and text words. The search is up‐to‐date as of October 1, 2012. Selection criteria Only randomised controlled trials (RCT) were considered for inclusion. Blinded and open trial designs were included. Children and adults with IMCMA were included. MOIT administered by any protocol were included. Data collection and analysis A total of 2111 unique records were identified and screened for potential inclusion. Studies were selected, data extracted and methodological quality assessed independently by two reviewers. We attempted to contact the study investigators to inquire about data not published that was required for the analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test. We estimated a pooled risk ratio (RR) for each outcome using a Mantel‐Haenzel fixed‐effect model if statistical heterogeneity was low as evaluated by an I² value less than 50%. Main results Of 157 records reviewed, 16 were included, representing five trials. In general, the studies were small and had inconsistent methodological rigor. Overall, the quality of evidence was rated as low. Each study used a different MOIT protocol. A total of 196 patients were studied (106 MOIT, 90 control) and all were children. Three studies were blinded and two used an avoidance diet control.  Sixty‐six patients (62%) in the MOIT group were able to tolerate a full serving of milk (about 200 mL) compared to seven (8%) of the control group (RR 6.61, 95% CI 3.51 to 12.44). In addition, 27 (25%) in the MOIT group could ingest a partial serving of milk (10 to 184 mL) while none could in the control group (RR 9.34, 95% CI 2.72 to 32.09). None of the studies assessed the patients following a period off immunotherapy. Adverse reactions were common (97 of 106 MOIT patients had at least one symptom), although most were local and mild. Because of variability in reporting methods, adverse effects could not be combined quantitatively. For every 11 patients receiving MOIT, one required intramuscular epinephrine. One patient required it on two occasions. Authors' conclusions Studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and the quality of evidence is generally low. The current evidence shows that MOIT can lead to desensitization in the majority of individuals with IMCMA although the development of long‐term tolerance has not been established. A major drawback of MOIT is the frequency of adverse effects, although most are mild and self‐limited. The use of parenteral epinephrine is not infrequent. Because there are no standardized protocols, guidelines would be required prior to incorporating desensitization into clinical practice. Plain language summary Repetitive, increasing doses of daily milk for treatment of milk allergy To date, the only option to treat food allergy is strict avoidance of the food and carrying an epinephrine injector (Epipen/Twinject) in case of an allergic reaction. For a food like cow's milk, avoidance is very difficult because it is found in many foods. The constant fear of accidentally eating or drinking cow's milk and anxiety related to carrying an injector has negative effects on quality of life. Accidentally having milk can cause life‐threatening reactions. Oral immunotherapy involves initially taking a very small amount of the allergen, in the case of milk allergy, cow's milk, and slowly increasing the amount each day until a full serving is reached. This may change the way the body's immune system sees the allergen, thereby increasing the amount of milk that can be eaten or drunk with no reaction. We identified randomized controlled trials that compared oral immunotherapy to placebo or continued avoidance diet in children and adults with cow's milk allergy. Five studies satisfied our inclusion criteria. In total there were 196 participants (106 in the treatment group and 90 in the control), all of whom were children. In general, the quality of the studies was low. Because the trials involved small numbers and there were problems with the way they were done, further research is needed. The current evidence shows that oral immunotherapy can help a majority of allergic children tolerate a full serving of milk, as long as they continue drinking this amount each day. However, it is not known if this protection is continued if the immunotherapy is stopped for some time. Side effects during oral immunotherapy are frequent and most patients will have at least some mild symptoms. In the studies we included, for every 11 patients who received oral immunotherapy, one needed to be treated with epinephrine injection at some point for a serious allergic reaction to the therapy.",11,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Oral; Adult; Animals; Child; Desensitization, Immunologic [adverse effects, *methods]; Humans; Milk Hypersensitivity [immunology, *therapy]; Milk [adverse effects, immunology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD009542.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009542.pub2,Tobacco Addiction

The clinical signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are mediated by the release of histamine by mast cells. Histamine antagonists (also called antihistamines) inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine H1 receptors, antagonising the vasoconstrictor, and to a lesser extent, the vasodilator effects of histamine. Mast cell stabilisers inhibit degranulation and consequently the release of histamine by interrupting the normal chain of intracellular signals.    Topical treatments include eye drops with antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, combinations of the previous treatments, and corticosteroids. Standard treatment is based on topical antihistamines alone or topical mast cell stabilisers alone or a combination of treatments. There is clinical uncertainty about the relative efficacy and safety of topical treatment. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, for use in treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2014), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) ( www.controlled‐trials.com ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 July 2014. We also searched the reference lists of review articles and relevant trial reports for details of further relevant publications. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, with placebo, no treatment or to any other antihistamine or mast cell stabiliser, or both, that examined people with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis, or both. The primary outcome was any participant‐reported evaluation (by questionnaire) of severity of four main ocular symptoms: itching, irritation, watering eye (tearing), and photophobia (dislike of light), both separately and, if possible, by an overall symptom score. We considered any follow‐up time between one week and one year. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion among review authors and the involvement of a third review author. We followed standard methodological approaches used by Cochrane. Main results We identified 30 trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised, with 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons. The following antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers were evaluated in at least one RCT: nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate, olopatadine, ketotifen, azelastine, emedastine, levocabastine (or levocabastine), mequitazine, bepotastine besilate, combination of antazoline and tetryzoline, combination of levocabastine and pemirolast potassium. The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). We observed a large variability in reporting outcomes. The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low. Trials evaluated only short‐term effects, with a range of treatment of one to eight weeks. Meta‐analysis was only possible in one comparison (olopatadine versus ketotifen). There was some evidence to support that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo. There were no reported serious adverse events related to the use of topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers treatment. Authors' conclusions It seems that all reported topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo in the short term. However, there is no long‐term data on their efficacy. Direct comparisons of different antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers need to be interpreted with caution. Overall, topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers appear to be safe and well tolerated. We observed a large variability in outcomes reported. Poor quality of reporting challenged the synthesis of evidence. Plain language summary Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers for treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis Review question   Are treatments with eye drops of antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, effective and safe in people with seasonal and allergic conjunctivitis? The main outcome measure was eye symptoms reported by participants, including eye itching, irritation (burning sensation), watering eyes (tearing), and photophobia (dislike of light). We found 30 trials. Background   Conjunctivitis refers to inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin tissue that covers the sclera (white part of the eye). Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis is the most common type of allergic conjunctivitis. Although this condition does not cause sight loss, it can cause intense itching and eye watering. Eye drops with antihistamines or mast cell stabilisers, or both are commonly used. Study characteristics   The evidence is current to July 2014. Among the 30 studies reviewed there were 17 different comparisons, including 4344 participants ranging in age between 4 and 85 years. The duration of treatment ranged from one to eight weeks. Ten out of 30 studies were funded by the drug manufacturer (8 totally and 2 partially funded); 20 studies did not report any source of funding. There was inconsistency in the way the effect of treatment was measured and reported. Overall risk of bias was low. Key results   Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, are safe and effective for reducing symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. We found insufficient evidence to discern which topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers are the most effective.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Anti‐Allergic Agents [*administration & dosage]; Conjunctivitis, Allergic [*drug therapy]; Histamine Antagonists [*administration & dosage]; Histamine [metabolism]; Humans; Mast Cells [*drug effects, metabolism]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Seasons",10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009566.pub2,Eyes and Vision

Objectives To assess the effects of dietary exclusions for the treatment of established atopic eczema. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (to March 2006), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in  The Cochrane Library  ( Issue  1, 2006), MEDLINE (2003 to March 2006), EMBASE (2003 to March 2006), LILACS (to March 2006), PsycINFO (1806 to March 2006), AMED (1985 to March 2006), ISI Web of Science (March 2006), www.controlled‐trials.com, www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.nottingham.ac.uk/ongoingskintrials (March 2006). Pharmaceutical companies were contacted where appropriate for reviews or unpublished trials. Selection criteria People who have atopic eczema as diagnosed by a doctor. Data collection and analysis Two independent authors carried out study selection and assessment of methodological quality. Main results We found 9 RCTs involving a total of 421 participants of which 6 were studies of egg and milk exclusion (N=288), 1 was a study of few foods (N=85) and 2 were studies of an elemental diet (N=48). There appears to be no benefit of an egg and milk free diet in unselected participants with atopic eczema. There is also no evidence of benefit in the use of an elemental or few‐foods diet in unselected cases of atopic eczema. There may be some benefit in using an egg‐free diet in infants with suspected egg allergy who have positive specific IgE to eggs ‐ one study found 51% of the children had a significant improvement in body surface area with the exclusion diet compared to normal diet (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.11) and change in surface area and severity score was significantly improved in the exclusion diet compared to the normal diet at the end of 6 weeks (MD 5.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 10.81) and end of treatment (MD 6.10, 95% CI 0.06 to12.14). Methodological difficulties have made it difficult to interpret these studies. Poor concealment of randomisation allocation, lack of blinding and high dropout rates without an intention‐to‐treat analysis indicates that these studies should be interpreted with great caution. Authors' conclusions There may be some benefit in using an egg‐free diet in infants with suspected egg allergy who have positive specific IgE to eggs. Little evidence supports the use of various exclusion diets in unselected people with atopic eczema, but that may be because they were not allergic to those substances in the first place. Lack of any benefit may also be because the studies were too small and poorly reported. Future studies should be appropriately powered focusing on participants with a proven food allergy. In addition a distinction should be made between young children whose food allergies improve with time and older children/adults. Plain language summary Dietary exclusions for improving established atopic eczema in adults and children Atopic eczema is the most common inflammatory skin disease of childhood in developed countries. The cause of atopic eczema is probably due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Atopic eczema varies in severity, often from one hour to the next and the disease can be associated with complications such as bacterial and viral infections. There is a substantial economic cost not only to the family of the person with atopic eczema but also to health services. Although there is currently no cure for atopic eczema, a wide range of treatments are used to control the symptoms. One such approach is a dietary one, whereby certain foods such as cows' milk are excluded on the basis that they are thought to cause eczema to worsen. The reason for undertaking this review is because the effectiveness of removing various foods from the diet in the short term management of atopic eczema is unclear. The general quality of the studies was poor. The main findings of the review suggest that there is some evidence from one study for the use of an egg‐free diet in infants with a suspected egg allergy who have positive specific IgE antibodies to eggs in their blood. Other studies that compared a dietary exclusion with ordinary diets did not test the people taking part to see if they were allergic to the foods concerned. There appears to be little benefit in eliminating cows milk from the diet or using an elemental (liquid diet containing only amino acids, carbohydrates, fat, minerals and vitamins) or 'few foods diet' for improving atopic eczema in people who have not undergone any form of testing. Three of the studies used soya based substitute which itself can be allergenic to people with atopic eczema. Adhering to elimination diets is difficult. The studies were performed in different populations with only one study describing the severity of the atopic eczema. The clinical relevance of changes in severity scores obtained in many studies is unknown.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Dermatitis, Atopic [*diet therapy]; Egg Hypersensitivity [diet therapy]; Food, Formulated; Humans; Milk Hypersensitivity [diet therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD005203.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005203.pub2,Skin
CD003559.PUB4,"Normansell, R; Walker, S; Milan, SJ; Walters, EH; Nair, P",Omalizumab for asthma in adults and children,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2014,"Abstract - Background Asthma is a respiratory (airway) condition that affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits free serum immunoglobulin E (IgE). It is called an 'anti‐IgE' drug. IgE is an immune mediator involved in clinical manifestations of asthma. A recent update of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in 2013 recommends omalizumab for use as add‐on therapy in adults and children over six years of age with inadequately controlled severe persistent allergic IgE‐mediated asthma who require continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids. Objectives To assess the effects of omalizumab versus placebo or conventional therapy for asthma in adults and children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials for potentially relevant studies. The most recent search was performed in June 2013. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and searched online trial registries and drug company websites. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials examining anti‐IgE administered in any manner for any duration. Trials with co‐interventions were included, as long as they were the same in each arm. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted and entered data. Three modes of administration were identified from the published literature: inhaled, intravenous and subcutaneous injection. The main focus of the updated review is subcutaneous administration, as this route is currently used in clinical practice. Subgroup analysis was performed by asthma severity. Data were extracted from published and unpublished sources. Main results In all, 25 trials were included in the review, including 11 new studies since the last update, for a total of 19 that considered the efficacy of subcutaneous anti‐IgE treatment as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids. For participants with moderate or severe asthma who were receiving background inhaled corticosteroid steroid (ICS) therapy, a significant advantage favoured subcutaneous omalizumab with regard to experiencing an asthma exacerbation (odds ratio (OR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.60; ten studies, 3261 participants). This represents an absolute reduction from 26% for participants suffering an exacerbation on placebo to 16% on omalizumab, over 16 to 60 weeks. A significant benefit was noted for subcutaneous omalizumab versus placebo with regard to reducing hospitalisations (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; four studies, 1824 participants), representing an absolute reduction in risk from 3% with placebo to 0.5% with omalizumab over 28 to 60 weeks. No separate data on hospitalisations were available for the severe asthma subgroup, and all of these data were reported for participants with the diagnosis of moderate to severe asthma. Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab were also significantly more likely to be able to withdraw their ICS completely than those treated with placebo (OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.00 to 3.13), and a small but statistically significant reduction in daily inhaled steroid dose was reported for omalizumab‐treated participants compared with those given placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) ‐118 mcg beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) equivalent per day, 95% CI ‐154 to ‐84). However, no significant difference between omalizumab and placebo treatment groups was seen in the number of participants who were able to withdraw from oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.63). Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids required a small but significant reduction in rescue beta 2 ‐agonist medication compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) ‐0.39 puffs per day, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.24; nine studies, 3524 participants). This benefit was observed in both the moderate to severe (MD ‐0.58, 95% CI ‐0.84 to ‐0.31) and severe (MD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.10) asthma subgroups on a background therapy of inhaled corticosteroids; however, no significant difference between subcutaneous omalizumab and placebo was noted for this outcome in participants with severe asthma who were receiving a background therapy of inhaled plus oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer serious adverse events were reported in participants assigned to subcutaneous omalizumab than in those receiving placebo (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 15 studies, 5713 participants), but more injection site reactions were observed (from 5.6% with placebo to 9.1% with omalizumab). To reflect current clinical practice, discussion of the results is limited to subcutaneous use, and trials involving intravenous and inhaled routes have been archived. Authors' conclusions Omalizumab was effective in reducing asthma exacerbations and hospitalisations as an adjunctive therapy to inhaled steroids and during steroid tapering phases of clinical trials. Omalizumab was significantly more effective than placebo in increasing the numbers of participants who were able to reduce or withdraw their inhaled steroids. Omalizumab was generally well tolerated, although more injection site reactions were seen with omalizumab. Further assessment in paediatric populations is necessary, as is direct double‐dummy comparison with ICS. Although subgroup analyses suggest that participants receiving prednisolone had better asthma control when they received omalizumab, it remains to be tested prospectively whether the addition of omalizumab has a prednisolone‐sparing effect. It is also not clear whether there is a threshold level of baseline serum IgE for optimum efficacy of omalizumab. Given the high cost of the drug, identification of biomarkers predictive of response is of major importance for future research. Plain language summary Omalizumab for chronic asthma in adults and children Review question We reviewed the evidence for the effect of omalizumab on people with asthma when compared with placebo. We focused on whether omalizumab is a beneficial but safe treatment for adults and children with asthma. Background Asthma is a respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is thought that allergy may be an important part of the disease for many people with asthma. Omalizumab is a drug that targets a protein, called IgE, and removes it from free circulation in the body. IgE is centrally involved in allergy. Omalizumab is an expensive drug that is usually given by injection under the skin every two to four weeks. It is licenced for use in asthma sufferers who are not being adequately treated with standard therapy and who require frequent courses or continuous use of oral steroid tablets. We looked for evidence on whether administration of omalizumab is better or worse than giving placebo. Study characteristics Twenty‐five studies, involving 6382 people, were included in this review. These studies lasted between eight and 60 weeks. All of the people included in the studies had asthma, of different severity. Both men and women were included, and some of the studies included children and young people. All studies compared omalizumab versus placebo. In keeping with current medical practice, most studies (21 of 25) used omalizumab given by injection under the skin. Some of the older studies used omalizumab injected into a vein or given by inhalation. The evidence presented here is current to June 2013. Most of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. Key results We found that people receiving omalizumab were less likely to have a flare‐up (‘exacerbation’) of their asthma. For example, on average, 26 of 100 people who were receiving placebo (over a 16 to 60‐week period) had an exacerbation compared with an average of 16 of 100 people receiving omalizumab. People receiving omalizumab were also more likely to be able to reduce the doses of inhaled steroids. For example, on average, 21 of 100 people with moderate or severe asthma who were receiving placebo were able to completely stop their inhaled steroids (over a 28 to 32‐week period) compared with an average of 40 of 100 receiving omalizumab. People receiving omalizumab also experienced improvement in their asthma symptoms and in their health‐related quality of life. People receiving omalizumab were no more or less likely to have unwanted side effects overall. However, people receiving omalizumab were more likely to have skin reactions at the site of the injection. Perhaps unfortunately, many of the trials in this review included participants with moderate asthma, and this drug is not licenced for this group. More trials need to focus on whether this drug is effective in people with the most severe asthma; evidence for efficacy in this group is poor, in spite of current guidelines. Quality of the evidence The evidence presented in this review is generally of moderate quality. Most of the studies did not clearly explain how investigators decided which people would receive omalizumab and which would receive placebo, and this decision is an important part of well‐conducted studies.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adrenal Cortex Hormones [therapeutic use]; Adult; Antibodies, Anti‐Idiotypic [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Anti‐Asthmatic Agents [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Asthma [*drug therapy, immunology]; Child; Chronic Disease; Humans; Immunoglobulin E [blood, *immunology]; Injections, Subcutaneous; Omalizumab; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD003559.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003559.pub4,Airways
CD007517.PUB3,"Agnihotry, A; Fedorowicz, Z; Nasser, M",Adhesively bonded versus non‐bonded amalgam restorations for dental caries,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2016,"Abstract - Background Dental caries (tooth decay) is one of the commonest diseases which afflicts mankind, and has been estimated to affect up to 80% of people in high‐income countries. Caries adversely affects and progressively destroys the tissues of the tooth, including the dental pulp (nerve), leaving teeth unsightly, weakened and with impaired function. The treatment of lesions of dental caries, which are progressing through dentine and have caused the formation of a cavity, involves the provision of dental restorations (fillings). This review updates the previous version published in 2009. Objectives To assess the effects of adhesive bonding on the in‐service performance and longevity of dental amalgam restorations. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2016) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2016). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry ( http://clinicaltrials.gov ) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ) (both to 21 January 2016) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing adhesively bonded versus traditional non‐bonded amalgam restorations in conventional preparations utilising deliberate retention, in adults with permanent molar and premolar teeth suitable for Class I and II amalgam restorations only. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. Main results One trial with 31 patients who received 113 restorations was included. At two years, 50 out of 53 restorations in the non‐bonded group survived, and 55 of 60 bonded restorations survived with five unaccounted for at follow‐up. Post‐insertion sensitivity was not significantly different (P > 0.05) at baseline or two‐year follow‐up. No fractures of tooth tissue were reported and there was no significant difference between the groups or matched pairs of restorations in their marginal adaptation (P > 0.05). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence to either claim or refute a difference in survival between bonded and non‐bonded amalgam restorations. This review only found one under‐reported trial. This trial did not find any significant difference in the in‐service performance of moderately sized adhesively bonded amalgam restorations, in terms of their survival rate and marginal integrity, in comparison to non‐bonded amalgam restorations over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred. Plain language summary Adhesively or non‐adhesively bonded amalgam restorations for dental caries Review question Does adding adhesive designed to bond dental amalgam fillings to teeth make the fillings perform better and last longer than fillings without it? Background Tooth decay is a common problem affecting both children and adults. Cavities form in the teeth by the action of acid produced by bacteria present in dental plaque or biofilm. A number of techniques and a variety of materials can be used to restore or fill teeth affected by decay. One of the most commonly used and comparatively cheap filling materials is dental amalgam (a mixture of mercury and metal alloy particles). The review authors sought to evaluate the added benefit of using an adhesive to bond amalgam to tooth structure to see if bonded fillings would last longer and perform better. Study characteristics The evidence in this review, carried out by authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group, is up to date as of 21 January 2016. One trial with 31 participants (21 male, 10 female) who received 113 restorations was included. The study took place in the UK in a university dental hospital environment. Participants were chosen who were suitable for routine dental treatment. The comparison made was between teeth in the same person on opposite sides of the mouth, one treated with the bonded technique, the other without. At two years no difference was found. Key results Only one study, which provided limited information, showed that for medium sized fillings there was no difference in sensitivity between the bonded and non‐bonded fillings after their placement and that bonding of amalgam to tooth did not have any effect on the survival of the filling over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred. There is a wide range of bonding agents developed over a number of years that are available for use by dentists. It is therefore very disappointing that there is such a lack of suitable trials of their effectiveness. Quality of the evidence There was only one included study and it provides insufficient evidence that adhesively bonded amalgam restorations perform any better than non‐adhesively bonded amalgam restoration when followed up for two years. The quality of the evidence is low. In addition, the university dental clinic setting may mean that the participants are not representative of the general population and the treatment offered not typical of that in general dental practice so the results may not be generalisable.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Dental Restoration Failure; Adult; Dental Amalgam [*therapeutic use]; Dental Bonding [*methods]; Dental Caries [*therapy]; Dental Restoration, Permanent [*methods]; Humans",10.1002/14651858.CD007517.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007517.pub3,Oral Health

Traditionally replacement was the ideal approach to treat defective amalgam restorations, however, repair offers an alternative more conservative approach where restorations are only partially defective. Repairing a restoration has the potential of taking less time and may sometimes be performed without the use of local anaesthesia hence it may be less distressing for a patient when compared with replacement. Repair of amalgam restorations is often more conservative of the tooth structure than replacement. Objectives To evaluate the effects of replacing (with amalgam) versus repair (with amalgam) in the management of defective amalgam dental restorations in permanent molar and premolar teeth. Search methods For the identification of studies relevant to this review we searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 5 August 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 7); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 5 August 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 5 August 2013); BIOSIS via Web of Knowledge (1969 to 5 August 2013); Web of Science (1945 to 5 August 2013) and OpenGrey (to 5 August 2013). Researchers, experts and organisations known to be involved in this field were contacted in order to trace unpublished or ongoing studies. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: randomised controlled trial (including split‐mouth studies), involving replacement and repair of amalgam restorations in adults with a defective restoration in a molar or premolar tooth/teeth. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts for each article identified by the searches in order to decide whether the article was likely to be relevant. Full papers were obtained for relevant articles and both review authors studied these. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were to be followed for data synthesis. Main results The search strategy retrieved 201 potentially eligible studies after de‐duplication. After examination of the titles and abstracts, full texts of the relevant studies were retrieved but none of these met the inclusion criteria of the review. Authors' conclusions There are no published randomised controlled trials relevant to this review question. There is therefore a need for methodologically sound randomised controlled trials that are reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement ( www.consort‐statement.org/ ). Further research also needs to explore qualitatively the views of patients on repairing versus replacement and investigate themes around pain, distress and anxiety, time and costs. Plain language summary Metal‐based, metallic fillings: is it better to repair or replace faulty metal‐based fillings for adults? Review question Is it more effective to repair or replace faulty fillings that have been constructed from amalgam (a mixture of various metals and mercury) in molar teeth towards the back of the mouth in adults? Background Fillings are used as part of general dental treatment to rebuild teeth after a patient develops tooth decay or damages the surface of their tooth in some way. Fillings also help to prevent further damage occurring (this can be through further tooth decay under the filling or from impact), but they must be maintained to ensure that the fillings continue to protect what is left of the original tooth. As with any filling material these fillings have a limited life‐span. Traditionally faulty fillings have been replaced, however this approach may involve the loss of further bits of tooth as the cavity is emptied and re‐filled. An alternative approach is to repair the faulty filling. Repairing fillings may take less time, and as some repairs can be performed without the need to numb the area (local anaesthesia), a repair may be less distressing for the patient when compared with the option of replacing the filling. Issues such as pain, anxiety, distress, time and cost are important considerations for dentists as well as patients. This review aims to compare whether it is better to replace or repair amalgam fillings. The evidence for repair or replacement of resin composite fillings is contained in a separate review. Study characteristics This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, and the evidence is current up to 5 August 2013.

However, there are concerns over the use of amalgam restorations (fillings) with regard to mercury release in the body and the environmental impact of mercury disposal. Dental composite resin materials are an aesthetic alternative to amalgam, and their mechanical properties have developed sufficiently to make them suitable for restoring posterior teeth. Nevertheless, composite resin materials may have potential for toxicity to human health and the environment. The United Nations Environment Programme has established the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which is an international treaty that aims ""to protect the [sic] human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds"". It entered into force in August 2017, and as of February 2021 had been ratified by 127 governments. Ratification involves committing to the adoption of at least two of nine proposed measures to phase down the use of mercury, including amalgam in dentistry. In light of this, we have updated a review originally published in 2014, expanding the scope of the review by undertaking an additional search for harms outcomes. Our review synthesises the results of studies that evaluate the long‐term effectiveness and safety of amalgam versus composite resin restorations, and evaluates the level of certainty we can have in that evidence. Objectives To examine the effects (i.e. efficacy and safety) of direct composite resin fillings versus amalgam fillings. Search methods An information specialist searched five bibliographic databases up to 16 February 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies Selection criteria To assess efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dental composite resin with amalgam restorations in permanent posterior teeth that assessed restoration failure or survival at follow‐up of at least three years. To assess safety, we sought non‐randomised studies in addition to RCTs that directly compared composite resin and amalgam restorative materials and measured toxicity, sensitivity, allergy, or injury. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included a total of eight studies in this updated review, all of which were RCTs. Two studies used a parallel‐group design, and six used a split‐mouth design. We judged all of the included studies to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding and issues related to unit of analysis. We identified one new trial since the previous version of this review (2014), as well as eight additional papers that assessed safety, all of which related to the two parallel‐group studies that were already included in the review. For our primary meta‐analyses, we combined data from the two parallel‐group trials, which involved 1645 composite restorations and 1365 amalgam restorations in 921 children. We found low‐certainty evidence that composite resin restorations had almost double the risk of failure compared to amalgam restorations (risk ratio (RR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 2.35; P < 0.001), and were at much higher risk of secondary caries (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.74; P < 0.001). We found low‐certainty evidence that composite resin restorations were not more likely to result in restoration fracture (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.64; P = 0.66). Six trials used a split‐mouth design. We considered these studies separately, as their reliability was compromised due to poor reporting, unit of analysis errors, and variability in methods and findings. Subgroup analysis showed that the findings were consistent with the results of the parallel‐group studies. Three trials investigated possible harms of dental restorations. Higher urinary mercury levels were reported amongst children with amalgam restorations in two trials, but the levels were lower than what is known to be toxic. Some differences between amalgam and composite resin groups were observed on certain measures of renal, neuropsychological, and psychosocial function, physical development, and postoperative sensitivity; however, no consistent or clinically important harms were found. We considered that the vast number of comparisons made false‐positive results likely. There was no evidence of differences between the amalgam and composite resin groups in neurological symptoms, immune function, and urinary porphyrin excretion. The evidence is of very low certainty, with most harms outcomes reported in only one trial. Authors' conclusions Low‐certainty evidence suggests that composite resin restorations may have almost double the failure rate of amalgam restorations. The risk of restoration fracture does not seem to be higher with composite resin restorations, but there is a much higher risk of developing secondary caries. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that there may be no clinically important differences in the safety profile of amalgam compared with composite resin dental restorations. This review supports the utility of amalgam restorations, and the results may be particularly useful in parts of the world where amalgam is still the material of choice to restore posterior teeth with proximal caries. Of note, however, is that composite resin materials have undergone important improvements in the years since the trials informing the primary analyses for this review were conducted. The global phase‐down of dental amalgam via the Minamata Convention on Mercury is an important consideration when deciding between amalgam and composite resin dental materials. The choice of which dental material to use will depend on shared decision‐making between dental providers and patients in the clinic setting, and local directives and protocols. Plain language summary Tooth‐colored resin fillings compared with amalgam fillings for permanent teeth at the back of the mouth Review question This review, carried out within Cochrane Oral Health, describes the effects of tooth‐coloured (composite resin) fillings compared with amalgam fillings when placed directly into cavities (holes) in permanent teeth in the back of the mouth. Background Traditionally, metal fillings made of a silver‐coloured material known as amalgam have been used to treat tooth decay in the back permanent teeth effectively and cheaply; however, due to unhappiness with their metallic look and concerns about the mercury they contain, they are being used less often, particularly in high‐income countries. The Minamata Convention on Mercury is a global agreement that has promoted a worldwide reduction in the use of mercury (including amalgam fillings) in order to reduce the impact of mercury on the environment. Tooth‐colored fillings made of a composite resin material have been used as an alternative to amalgam fillings. Initially, they were used only in the front teeth, but as their quality has improved, they have been used in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases until 16 February 2021 and found eight relevant studies. The studies evaluated 3285 composite fillings and 1955 amalgam fillings; however, it is unclear how many participants received these fillings. The exact age of participants was unclear in some studies, but the studies included both children and adults. The studies took place in the UK, the USA, Portugal, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Turkey. Participants in six studies received composite and amalgam fillings in different teeth (known as 'split‐mouth design'), whilst participants in the other two studies received either composite or amalgam fillings ('parallel‐group' design). Key results Our main analysis focused on the two parallel‐group studies that treated 921 children (aged 6 to 12 years) who had their teeth restored with amalgam (1365) or composite resin (1645) fillings. We found that composite resin fillings were significantly more likely to fail than amalgam fillings when used to fill cavities in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Tooth decay after a filling was placed (known as 'secondary caries') occurred more frequently with composite resin compared to amalgam fillings. There was no suggestion of a difference between the materials in the likelihood of filling breaking. Six of the trials used a 'split‐mouth' design, which means that each participant had both types of fillings in different teeth. These studies were less reliable, as they did not explain fully how they conducted the studies, and it was unclear how many people received the fillings. We analysed the split‐mouth studies separately from the parallel‐group studies, and undertook a statistical approach known as 'subgroup analysis'. This showed that the findings of these studies were compatible with the results from the two parallel‐group studies. Three studies reported negative side effects. Although we found that there were some possible side effects with each material used, this information is unreliable because the study authors carried out so many analyses that 'false positive' results were likely to be found. Overall, it seems that the materials may differ in terms of how safe they are, but the level of the differences identified in the studies may not be important. To summarise, we found that composite resin fillings may be almost twice as likely to fail compared with amalgam fillings when used for filling permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Composite fillings do not seem more likely to break, but do seem more likely than amalgam fillings to develop further tooth decay. The current evidence suggests there are no important differences in the safety of amalgam compared with composite resin dental fillings. Certainty of the evidence We judge the available evidence to be 'low certainty', which means that the results may change with future research. As the colour of the amalgam and composite resin fillings differed, it would not have been possible to 'blind' those involved in the study from knowing the treatment administered, so there was a high risk of bias in all of the included studies. In addition, the findings were imprecise and sometimes inconsistent, so we cannot be sure that the evidence is reliable.  Implications of the evidence Overall, the evidence suggests that amalgam restorations are effective, enduring, and safe, while composite resin restorations are more likely to fail and lead to secondary caries. However, the studies in this review were quite old, and composite resin materials have likely improved since the included studies were conducted. Patients and dental providers can discuss together which material they want to use when permanent teeth in the back of the mouth require fillings in the dental clinic. Governments around the world are trying to reduce the use of dental amalgam (according to the Minamata Convention on Mercury), and so each local area will have their own regulations and guidance.

As with any filling material composites have a finite life‐span. Traditionally, replacement was the ideal approach to treat defective composite restorations, however, repairing composites offers an alternative more conservative approach to the tooth structure where restorations are partly still serviceable. Repairing the restoration has the potential of taking less time and may sometimes be performed without the use of local anaesthesia hence it may be less distressing for a patient when compared with replacement. Objectives To evaluate the effects of replacing (with resin composite) versus repair (with resin composite) in the management of defective resin composite dental restorations in permanent molar and premolar teeth. Search methods For the identification of studies relevant to this review we searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 24 July 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 6); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 24 July 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 24 July 2013); BIOSIS via Web of Knowledge (1969 to 24 July 2013); Web of Science (1945 to 24 July 2013); and OpenGrey (to 24 July 2013). Researchers, experts and organisations known to be involved in this field were contacted in order to trace unpublished or ongoing studies. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: randomised controlled trial (including split‐mouth studies), involving replacement and repair of resin composite restorations in adults with a defective molar restoration in a permanent molar or premolar teeth. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts for each article identified by the searches in order to decide whether the article was likely to be relevant. Full papers were obtained for relevant articles and both review authors studied these. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were to be followed for data synthesis. Main results The search strategy retrieved 298 potentially eligible studies, after de‐duplication. After examination of the titles and abstracts, full texts of potentially relevant studies were retrieved but none of the retrieved studies met the inclusion criteria of the review. Authors' conclusions There are no published randomised controlled trials relevant to this review question. There is therefore a need for methodologically sound randomised controlled trials that are reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement ( www.consort‐statement.org/ ). Further research also needs to explore qualitatively the views of patients on repairing versus replacement and investigate themes around pain, anxiety and distress, time and costs. Plain language summary Tooth‐coloured, non‐metallic fillings: is it better to repair or replace faulty non‐metallic fillings for adults? Review question Is it more effective to repair or replace faulty tooth‐coloured fillings (resin composite) placed in molar teeth towards the back of the mouth in adults? Background Fillings are used as part of general dental treatment to rebuild teeth after a patient develops tooth decay or damages the surface of their tooth in some way. Fillings also help to prevent further damage occurring (this can be through further tooth decay under the filling or from impact), but they must be maintained to ensure that the fillings continue to protect what is left of the original tooth. Tooth‐coloured filling materials have increasingly been used in many countries as an alternative to the more traditional amalgam or metallic fillings. As with any filling material these fillings have a limited life‐span and eventually problems will occur when they break down or become faulty. Traditionally faulty fillings have been replaced, however this approach may involve the loss of further bits of tooth as the cavity is emptied and re‐filled. An alternative approach is to repair the faulty filling. Repairing fillings may take less time, and as some repairs can be performed without the need to numb the area (local anaesthesia), a repair may be less distressing for the patient when compared with the option of replacing the filling. Issues such as pain, anxiety, distress, time and cost are important considerations for dentists as well as patients. This review aims to compare whether it is better to replace or repair resin composite fillings. The evidence for repair or replacement of amalgam fillings is contained in a separate review. Study characteristics This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, and the evidence is current up to 24 July 2013.

CD009109.PUB3,"Sequeira‐Byron, P; Fedorowicz, Z; Carter, B; Nasser, M; Alrowaili, EF",Single crowns versus conventional fillings for the restoration of root‐filled teeth,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2015,"Abstract - Background Endodontic treatment involves removal of the dental pulp and its replacement by a root canal filling. Restoration of root filled teeth can be challenging due to structural differences between vital and non‐vital root‐filled teeth. Direct restoration involves placement of a restorative material e.g. amalgam or composite, directly into the tooth. Indirect restorations consist of cast metal or ceramic (porcelain) crowns. The choice of restoration depends on the amount of remaining tooth, and may influence durability and cost. The decision to use a post and core in addition to the crown is clinician driven. The comparative clinical performance of crowns or conventional fillings used to restore root‐filled teeth is unknown. This review updates the original, which was published in 2012. Objectives To assess the effects of restoration of endodontically treated teeth (with or without post and core) by crowns versus conventional filling materials. Search methods We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL via EBSCO, LILACS via BIREME. We also searched the reference lists of articles and ongoing trials registries.There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. The search is up‐to‐date as of 26 March 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐randomised controlled trials in participants with permanent teeth that have undergone endodontic treatment. Single full coverage crowns compared with any type of filling materials for direct restoration or indirect partial restorations (e.g. inlays and onlays). Comparisons considered the type of post and core used (cast or prefabricated post), if any. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trial and assessed its risk of bias. We carried out data analysis using the 'treatment as allocated' patient population, expressing estimates of intervention effect for dichotomous data as risk ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included one trial, which was judged to be at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias. The 117 participants with a root‐filled, premolar tooth restored with a carbon fibre post, were randomised to either a full coverage metal‐ceramic crown or direct adhesive composite restoration. None experienced a catastrophic failure (i.e. when the restoration cannot be repaired), although only 104 teeth were included in the final, three‐year assessment. There was no clear difference between the crown and composite group and the composite only group for non‐catastrophic failures of the restoration (1/54 versus 3/53; RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.04 to 3.05) or failures of the post (2/54 versus 1/53; RR 1.96; 95% CI 0.18 to 21.01) at three years. The quality of the evidence for these outcomes is very low. There was no evidence available for any of our secondary outcomes: patient satisfaction and quality of life, incidence or recurrence of caries, periodontal health status, and costs. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to assess the effects of crowns compared to conventional fillings for the restoration of root‐filled teeth. Until more evidence becomes available, clinicians should continue to base decisions about how to restore root‐filled teeth on their own clinical experience, whilst taking into consideration the individual circumstances and preferences of their patients. Plain language summary Single crowns or routine fillings for the restoration of root‐filled teeth Review question This review (an update of the original published in 2012) has been conducted to assess whether there is a difference in the effects of restoration of root‐filled teeth (with or without post and core) by indirect restorations (commonly crowns, inlays, or onlays) compared to conventional filling materials placed directly into the tooth. Background Root filling is a fairly routine dental procedure in which the injured or dead nerve of a tooth is removed and replaced by a root canal filling. However, the restoration of root‐filled teeth can be quite challenging as these teeth tend to be weaker than healthy ones. A dentist may use crowns (restorations made outside of the mouth and then cemented into place) or conventional fillings (direct filling with materials such as amalgam or composite/plastic resin). Although crowns may help to protect root‐filled teeth by covering them, conventional fillings demand less in terms of time, costs and removal of tooth structure. Study characteristics We searched the medical literature until 26 March 2015. This review includes one study with 117 participants in which a tooth (117 premolars) received a carbon fibre post, and was restored with either a fused porcelain to metal crown or a routine white filling. The study was of short duration (three years), included a relatively small number of participants, and was assessed to be at a high risk of bias due to missing results for people who dropped out of the study. Key results The evidence produced from one study concluded that none of the 117 root‐filled premolars experienced a catastrophic failure (i.e. one that cannot be repaired) after three years, although only 104 teeth were included in the final, three‐year assessment. The study concluded there was no difference between treatments for the risk of non‐catastrophic failure. There was no evidence available for any of our secondary outcomes: patient satisfaction and quality of life, incidence or recurrence of decay, periodontal health status, and costs. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence is very low. As there is only a single study, which is at high risk of bias, there is insufficient reliable evidence to determine whether single crowns are better than routine fillings. Future research should aim to provide more reliable information that can help clinicians to decide on appropriate treatment whilst taking into consideration the individual circumstances and preferences of their patients.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Crowns; *Tooth Root; Adult; Dental Restoration, Permanent [*methods]; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Post and Core Technique; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tooth, Nonvital [*rehabilitation]",10.1002/14651858.CD009109.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009109.pub3,Oral Health
CD007819.PUB3,"Pereira‐Cenci, T; Cenci, MS; Fedorowicz, Z; Azevedo, M",Antibacterial agents in composite restorations for the prevention of dental caries,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2013,"Abstract - Background Dental caries is a multifactorial disease in which the fermentation of food sugars by bacteria from the biofilm (dental plaque) leads to localised demineralisation of tooth surfaces, which may ultimately result in cavity formation. Resin composites are widely used in dentistry to restore teeth. These restorations can fail for a number of reasons, such as secondary caries, and restorative material fracture and other minor reasons. From these, secondary caries, which are caries lesions developed adjacent to restorations, is the main cause for restorations replacement. The presence of antibacterials in both the filling material and the bonding systems would theoretically be able to affect the initiation and progression of caries adjacent to restorations. This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2009. Objectives To assess the effects of antibacterial agents incorporated into composite restorations for the prevention of dental caries. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 23 July 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 6), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 23 July 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 23 July 2013). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register ( http://clinicaltrials.gov ), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( www.controlled‐trials.com ) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry platform ( www.who.int/trialsearch ) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing resin composite restorations containing antibacterial agents with composite restorations not containing antibacterial agents. Data collection and analysis Two review authors conducted screening of studies in duplicate and independently, and although no eligible trials were identified, the two authors had planned to extract data independently and assess trial quality using standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies. Main results We retrieved 308 references to studies, none of which matched the inclusion criteria for this review and all of which were excluded. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials on the effects of antibacterial agents incorporated into composite restorations for the prevention of dental caries. The absence of high level evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention emphasises the need for well designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled clinical trials. Thus, conclusions remain the same as the previously published review, with no included clinical trials. Plain language summary Use of antibacterial substances in resin‐based fillings to prevent further tooth decay (next to the filling) developing after treatment Review question The main question addressed by this review is how effective the use of antibacterial agents in composite (resin‐based, tooth‐coloured) fillings might be in preventing the development of further decay either underneath or next to the filling (secondary caries). Background When tooth decay (caries) has caused a cavity in a tooth a range of materials can be used as fillings. These include resin composite, glass ionomer cement, amalgam and compomers. Tooth decay that may develop next to or underneath, a filling at a later stage is a common concern in dental practice and may reduce the life span of these fillings. It is thought that including a substance that kills and prevents the growth of bacterial (also known as an antibacterial agent) in some dental fillings, for example resin composites, could help prevent the development of this secondary caries. Study characteristics The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 23 July 2013. The review authors have not found any trials to support or disprove the effectiveness of antibacterial agents incorporated into fillings to prevent further tooth decay. Key results No trials were found that were suitable for inclusion in this review.

CD010526.PUB3,"Schenkel, AB; Veitz‐Keenan, A",Dental cavity liners for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2019,"Abstract - Background Resin‐based composite (RBC) is currently accepted as a viable material for the restoration of caries for posterior permanent teeth requiring surgical treatment. Despite the fact that the thermal conductivity of the RBC restorative material closely approximates that of natural tooth structure, postoperative hypersensitivity is sometimes still an issue. Dental cavity liners have historically been used to protect the pulp from the toxic effects of some dental restorative materials and to prevent the pain of thermal conductivity by placing an insulating layer between restorative material and the remaining tooth structure. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2016. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of using dental cavity liners in the placement of Class I and Class II resin‐based composite posterior restorations in permanent teeth in children and adults. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 12 November 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library (searched 12 November 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 12 November 2018), Embase Ovid (1980 to 12 November 2018) and LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; 1982 to 12 November 2018). We searched  ClinicalTrials.gov  and the  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of the use of liners under Class I and Class II posterior resin‐based composite restorations in permanent teeth (in both adults and children). We included both parallel and split‐mouth designs. Data collection and analysis We utilized standard methodological procedures prescribed by Cochrane for data collection and analysis. Two review authors screened the search results and assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion against the review inclusion criteria. We conducted risk of bias assessments and data extraction independently and in duplicate. Where information was unclear we contacted study authors for clarification. Main results Eight studies, recruiting over 700 participants, compared the use of dental cavity liners to no liners for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations. Seven studies evaluated postoperative hypersensitivity measured by various methods. All studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. There was inconsistent evidence regarding postoperative hypersensitivity (either measured using cold response or patient‐reported), with a benefit shown at some, but not all, time points (low‐quality evidence). Four trials measured restoration longevity. Two of the studies were judged to be at high risk and two at unclear risk of bias. No difference in restoration failure rates were shown at 1 year follow‐up, with no failures reported in either group for three of the four studies; the fourth study had a risk ratio (RR) 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.00) (low‐quality evidence). Three studies evaluated restoration longevity at 2 years follow‐up and, again, no failures were shown in either group. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions There is inconsistent, low‐quality evidence regarding the difference in postoperative hypersensitivity subsequent to placing a dental cavity liner under Class I and Class II posterior resin‐based composite restorations in permanent posterior teeth in adults or children 15 years or older. Furthermore, no evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in the longevity of restorations placed with or without dental cavity liners. Plain language summary Dental cavity liners under tooth‐colored resin fillings placed into permanent teeth in the back of the mouth Review question This review was conducted to assess the effects of using liners under tooth‐colored resin fillings in cavities on the biting surface (Class I) and the biting surface and side(s) (Class II) of permanent teeth in the back of the mouth in children and adults. Background Tooth decay is the most common disease affecting children and adults worldwide. If left untreated, acid produced by bacteria in the dental plaque or biofilm forms cavities or holes in the teeth. A number of techniques and a variety of materials can be used to restore or fill teeth affected by decay. One of these materials is tooth‐colored, resin‐based composite or RBC. This material is increasingly used as an alternative to amalgam (a mixture of mercury and metal alloy particles). Since the 19th century liners have often been placed in cavities in the teeth under the filling material. The liners are thought to protect the living pulp of the tooth from filling materials themselves and also from their potential to allow more heat or cold through than the natural tooth would. Although RBC filling materials are thought to be similar to the natural material of teeth in terms of how they conduct heat, sensitivity to temperature change is sometimes still an issue for people after treatment. Study characteristics The evidence in this review, carried out by authors from Cochrane Oral Health, is up to date as of 12 November 2018. Eight studies, with over 700 participants, were included. Two studies were conducted in the USA, two in Thailand, two in Germany and one each in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The studies compared the use of liners under tooth‐colored resin fillings (RBC) in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth to no liners for Class I and Class II fillings. One of the two studies in the USA took place in dental practices, the others in university‐based dental schools. All participants were over 15 years of age. Key results Very little evidence was found to show that a liner under Class I and II RBC fillings in permanent teeth in the back of the mouth reduced sensitivity in adults or children 15 years or older. No evidence was found to show that there was any difference in the length of time fillings lasted when placed with or without a cavity liner.

Quality of evidence The body of evidence identified in this review does not allow for robust conclusions about the effects of dental cavity liners.

It is conventionally performed through a hole drilled into the crown of the affected tooth, namely orthograde root canal therapy. When it fails, retrograde filling, which seals the root canal from the root apex, is a good alternative. Many materials are used for retrograde filling. Since none meets all the criteria an ideal material should possess, selecting the most efficacious material is of utmost importance. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2016. Objectives To determine the effects of different materials used for retrograde filling in children and adults for whom retrograde filling is necessary in order to save the tooth. Search methods An Information Specialist searched five bibliographic databases up to 21 April 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. We also searched four databases in the Chinese language. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different retrograde filling materials, with the reported success rate that was assessed by clinical or radiological methods for which the follow‐up period was at least 12 months. Data collection and analysis Records were screened in duplicate by independent screeners. Two review authors extracted data independently and in duplicate. Original trial authors were contacted for any missing information. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We followed Cochrane's statistical guidelines and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included eight studies, all at high risk of bias, involving 1399 participants with 1471 teeth, published between 1995 and 2019, and six comparisons of retrograde filling materials. ‐ Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) versus intermediate restorative material (IRM): there may be little to no effect of MTA compared to IRM on success rate at one year, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.22; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies; 222 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence). ‐ MTA versus super ethoxybenzoic acid (Super‐EBA): there may be little to no effect of MTA compared to Super‐EBA on success rate at one year, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.10; 1 study; 192 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence). ‐ Super‐EBA versus IRM: the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of Super‐EBA compared with IRM on success rate at 1 year, with results indicating Super‐EBA may reduce or have no effect on success rate (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; 1 study; 194 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence). ‐ Dentine‐bonded resin composite versus glass ionomer cement: compared to glass ionomer cement, dentine‐bonded resin composite may increase the success rate of the treatment at 1 year, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.59; 1 study; 122 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence). Same result was obtained when considering the root as unit of analysis at one year (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.09; 1 study; 127 roots; very low‐certainty evidence). ‐ Glass ionomer cement versus amalgam: the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of glass ionomer cement compared with amalgam on success rate at one year, with results indicating glass ionomer cement may reduce or have no effect on success rate (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.12; 1 study; 105 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence). ‐ MTA versus root repair material (RRM): there may be little to no effect of MTA compared to RRM on success rate at one year, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies; 278 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence). Adverse events were not assessed by any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions Based on the present limited evidence, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion as to the benefits of any one material over another for retrograde filling in root canal therapy. We conclude that more high‐quality RCTs are required. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of different materials used for retrograde filling in people who need this treatment in order to save a tooth? Key messages ‐ Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of different materials used for retrograde filling in root canal therapy are unclear. ‐ The evidence is not robust enough to determine which material is best to use in retrograde filling. ‐ We need future studies to strengthen the evidence. What is retrograde filling in root canal therapy? The living part of the tooth, also known as the tooth pulp, can become permanently swollen because of damage or bacterial infection due to tooth decay. To deal with this problem, the dentist has to drill a hole on the top of the crown of the tooth to access the inner space of the tooth, the root canal system. The dentist will then remove the infected tissue and bacteria by a combination of mechanical cleaning and irrigation. After this is done, the dentist fills the space with an inactive packing material and seals the opening. This treatment is known as root canal therapy. Although results are generally good, a small number of failures can happen. This can be because the root canal system is complex and it is not always easy to completely eliminate all bacteria. These can spread and the infection around the root can last indefinitely. When root canal therapy fails, a retreatment called retrograde filling is a good alternative to save the tooth. During retrograde filling the dentist cuts a flap in the gum and creates a hole in the bone to get access to the bottom tip of the root of the tooth. After cutting off the tip, followed by thorough preparation, the apex is sealed (the apical seal), and the hole made by the dentist filled with a dental material. This sealing process is considered the most important factor in achieving success in a retrograde root filling. What materials can be used for retrograde filling? Many materials have been developed to seal the root tip, for example, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), intermediate restorative material (IRM), super ethoxybenzoic acid (Super‐EBA), dentine‐bonded resin composite, glass ionomer cement, amalgam, and root repair material (RRM). However, there is no agreement on which material is best. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which material works better for retrograde filling in root canal therapy, and whether they are associated with any unwanted (adverse) effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared different materials used for retrograde filling in root canal therapy. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found eight studies with a minimum duration of 12 months that involved 1399 people (1471 teeth) over 17 years of age undergoing retrograde filling using different types of filling material. The evidence: ‐ is not robust enough to determine which material is best to use in retrograde filling. No studies investigated the unwanted effects of any of the materials. What are the limitations of the evidence? The main limitations of the evidence are that studies: ‐ were very small; ‐ were conducted in ways that may have introduced errors into their results; and ‐ there were not enough studies to be certain about the results. Due to these limitations, we have little confidence in the evidence. How up to date is this evidence?

CD005512.PUB3,"Innes, NPT; Ricketts, D; Chong, LY; Keightley, AJ; Lamont, T; Santamaria, RM",Preformed crowns for decayed primary molar teeth,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2015,"Abstract - Background Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007. Objectives Primary objective To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non‐restorative caries treatment or no treatment. Secondary objective To explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;  The Cochrane Library,  2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register ( http://clinicaltrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non‐restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns. For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively'). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. Main results We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non‐restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique). We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. Crowns versus fillings All studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies). Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence). Crowns versus non‐restorative caries treatment Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non‐restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates. Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns One split‐mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn. Authors' conclusions Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non‐restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique. Plain language summary Preformed crowns for managing decayed primary molar teeth in children Background To stop further damage and restore function of primary molar teeth that are decayed or malformed, a dentist will usually use a filling (a soft material that is placed in the cavity and hardened) to restore the tooth to its original shape. Alternatively the dentist may place a crown over the tooth to cover it. This usually requires an injection in the gum to numb the tooth before trimming it down (conventional technique). These crowns are pre‐made (i.e. preformed) in a variety of sizes and can be metal or white, with the correct size being chosen to fit the trimmed down tooth. The Hall Technique is an alternative method for fitting metal crowns, where there is no need for an injection or tooth trimming as the crown is simply pushed over the tooth. Preformed crowns are recommended by specialists in children's dentistry for the management of baby back teeth (molars) when they are affected by moderate to advanced tooth decay, or where the enamel has malformed during development or the tooth has had to have root canal treatment. Review question This Cochrane review asked whether crowns are better than other ways of managing decay in children's baby teeth for reducing 'major failure' (an outcome that includes aspects such as toothache and dental abscess), pain during treatment and harm, and for improving satisfaction with treatment. It also asked whether metal or white crowns were better and whether a new fitting method called the Hall Technique was better than the conventional fitting technique. The review updates one originally published in 2007. Study characteristics We searched medical and dental sources for studies up to 21 January 2015. We identified five relevant studies. They were at high risk of bias because the participants knew which treatment they received and so did the people who treated them. Four studies compared crowns with fillings. Two of them compared metal crowns fitted using the conventional method with fillings and two compared metal crowns fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of the studies also compared the Hall Technique with 'non‐restorative caries treatment' (not using either a filling or crown but opening the cavity to make it possible to clean with a toothbrush, sealing with fluoride varnish and encouraging toothbrushing). The final study compared crowns made of two different materials (stainless steel versus stainless steel with a white covering). We looked at what happened for each treatment at the time of the dental appointment or within 24 hours of treatment, in the short term (less than 12 months) and long term (12 months to 48 months). Key results Teeth restored with preformed crowns are less likely to develop problems (e.g. abscess) or cause pain in the long term, compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique (no injections or tooth trimming) gave less discomfort at the time of the appointment, when compared with fillings. Crowns may increase the risk of gingival bleeding but this result was unclear. Only one small study compared crowns with non‐restorative caries treatment and one small study compared metal and white crowns, and we could draw no reliable conclusions from these. Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in any of the studies: these included time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. Quality of the evidence There is moderate quality evidence that crowns are more effective than fillings for managing decay in primary molar teeth. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns fitted using the Hall Technique are less likely to cause abscesses and pain than fillings. The evidence comparing preformed crowns with non‐restorative caries management, and comparing preformed metal crowns with preformed white crowns, is very low quality so we do not know which is better. Author's conclusion Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with decay, or that have had pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings.

Root canal retreatment is a non‐surgical procedure that involves removal of root canal filling materials from the tooth, followed by cleaning, shaping and obturating of the canals. Root‐end resection is a surgical procedure that involves exposure of the periapical lesion through an osteotomy, surgical removal of the lesion, removal of part of the root‐end tip ,  disinfection and, commonly, retrograde sealing or filling of the apical portion of the remaining root canal. This review updates one published in 2008. Objectives To assess effects of surgical and non‐surgical therapy for retreatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. To assess effects of surgical root‐end resection under various conditions, for example, when different materials, devices or techniques are used. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 10 February 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 10 February 2016) and Embase Ovid (1980 to 10 February 2016). We searched the US National Registry of Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials (to 10 February 2016). We placed no restrictions regarding language and publication date. We handsearched the reference lists of the studies retrieved and key journals in the field of endodontics. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with periapical pathosis. Studies could compare surgery versus non‐surgical treatment or could compare different types of surgery. Outcome measures were healing of the periapical lesion assessed after one‐year follow‐up or longer; postoperative pain and discomfort; and adverse effects such as tooth loss, mobility, soft tissue recession, abscess, infection, neurological damage or loss of root sealing material evaluated through radiographs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies and assessed their risk of bias. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We combined results of trials assessing comparable outcomes using the fixed‐effect model, with risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used generic inverse variance for split‐mouth studies. Main results We included 20 RCTs. Two trials at high risk of bias assessed surgery versus a non‐surgical approach: root‐end resection with root‐end filling versus root canal retreatment. The other 18 trials evaluated different surgical protocols: cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) versus periapical radiography for preoperative assessment (one study at high risk of bias); antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo (one study at unclear risk); different magnification devices (loupes, surgical microscope, endoscope) (two studies at high risk); types of incision (papilla base incision, sulcular incision) (one study at high risk and one at unclear risk); ultrasonic devices versus handpiece burs (one study at high risk); types of root‐end filling material (glass ionomer cement, amalgam, intermediate restorative material (IRM), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), gutta‐percha (GP), super‐ethoxy benzoic acid (EBA)) (five studies at high risk of bias, one at unclear risk and one at low risk); grafting versus no grafting (three studies at high risk and one at unclear risk); and low energy level laser therapy versus placebo (irradiation without laser activation) versus control (no use of the laser device) (one study at high risk). There was no clear evidence of superiority of the surgical or non‐surgical approach for healing at one‐year follow‐up (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.35; two RCTs, 126 participants) or at four‐ or 10‐year follow‐up (one RCT, 82 to 95 participants), although the evidence is very low quality. More participants in the surgically treated group reported pain in the first week after treatment (RR 3.34, 95% CI 2.05 to 5.43; one RCT, 87 participants; low quality evidence). In terms of surgical protocols, there was some inconclusive evidence that ultrasonic devices for root‐end preparation may improve healing one year after retreatment, when compared with the traditional bur (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.30; one RCT, 290 participants; low quality evidence). There was evidence of better healing when root‐ends were filled with MTA than when they were treated by smoothing of orthograde GP root filling, after one‐year follow‐up (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.24; one RCT, 46 participants; low quality evidence). There was no evidence that using CBCT rather than radiography for preoperative evaluation was advantageous for healing (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.47; one RCT, 39 participants; very low quality evidence), nor that any magnification device affected healing more than any other (loupes versus endoscope at one year: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20; microscope versus endoscope at two years: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.15; one RCT, 70 participants, low quality evidence). There was no evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced incidence of postoperative infection (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.64; one RCT, 250 participants; low quality evidence). There was some evidence that using a papilla base incision (PBI) may be beneficial for preservation of the interdental papilla compared with complete papilla mobilisation (one RCT (split‐mouth), 12 participants/24 sites; very low quality evidence). There was no evidence of less pain in the PBI group at day 1 post surgery (one RCT, 38 participants; very low quality evidence). There was evidence that adjunctive use of a gel of plasma rich in growth factors reduced postoperative pain compared with no grafting (measured on visual analogue scale: one day postoperative MD ‐51.60 mm, 95% CI ‐63.43 to ‐39.77; one RCT, 36 participants; low quality evidence). There was no evidence that use of low energy level laser therapy (LLLT) prevented postoperative pain (very low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Available evidence does not provide clinicians with reliable guidelines for treating periapical lesions. Further research is necessary to understand the effects of surgical versus non‐surgical approaches, and to determine which surgical procedures provide the best results for periapical lesion healing and postoperative quality of life. Future studies should use standardised techniques and success criteria, precisely defined outcomes and the participant as the unit of analysis. Plain language summary Procedures for retreatment of failed root canal therapy Review question We aimed to find out the best way to retreat patients for whom root canal therapy has failed. We wanted to know whether surgical or non‐surgical retreatment was better, and if using specific materials, devices or procedures in surgery might improve healing of the lesion or reduce patient discomfort after surgery. This review updates one published in 2008. Background In root canal therapy, the infected pulp of a tooth is removed, and the root cavity is disinfected and filled with a sealing material. However, if micro‐organisms that caused the infection are not completely removed, after some time they may cause a disease at the tip of the root, called a periapical lesion. Treatment for this requires a second intervention, which can be performed in the same way as the first treatment, from the crown into the root canal, to remove the existing filler and clean and disinfect as well as possible before sealing again. Alternatively, should this procedure fail, or if it is not feasible, a surgical intervention can be used. Study characteristics We conducted a wide search of medical and dental literature up to 10 February 2016. We identified 20 studies that randomised participants to groups receiving different forms of retreatment of periapical lesions. These studies evaluated nine different comparisons: surgical versus non‐surgical treatment (two studies, one monitoring participants for up to 10 years); two diagnostic radiographic techniques (one study); the occurrence of postoperative infection with or without antibiotics (one study); use of different devices for enhancing the surgeon's view during the most critical steps of the surgical procedure (one study); the aesthetic appearance of the gum next to the treated tooth and pain after operation when two different types of gingival incision were used (two studies); use of minimally invasive ultrasonic devices or traditional rotating burs to manage the tip of the root (one study); use of different materials for filling the root‐end (seven studies); filling of the periapical lesion with a grafting material (four studies); and exposure of the surgical site to a low energy level laser to reduce pain (one study). Key results There is no evidence that a surgical approach leads to better results compared with non‐surgical retreatment at one year (or at four or 10 years) after intervention. However, people treated surgically reported more pain and swelling during the first week after treatment. Different surgical techniques were evaluated. Healing at one‐year follow‐up seemed to be improved by use of ultrasonic devices, instead of the traditional bur, for root‐end preparation. There was some evidence of better healing at one‐year follow‐up when root‐ends were filled with mineral trioxide aggregate compared with their being treated by smoothing of orthograde gutta percha root filling. Use of a graft composed of a gel enriched with the patient's own platelets applied to the defect during the surgical procedure significantly reduced postoperative pain. Exposure to a low energy level laser did not apparently reduce pain at the surgical site. A small gingival incision may preserve the gum between two adjacent teeth, improving the aesthetic appearance and causing less pain after surgery. There was no evidence that use of antibiotics reduces the occurrence of postoperative infection (although when the procedure is done well, infection is an extremely rare event). Different ways of enhancing the surgeon's view did not lead to different results at least one year after operation, and results of retreatment were independent of the radiographic technique used to make the diagnosis. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence to be poor; therefore we cannot rely on the findings. Only one study was at low risk of bias;we judged the majority to be at high risk of bias. Author conclusions It is difficult to draw conclusions, as the evidence currently available is of low to very low quality. More randomised controlled trials conducted to high standards are needed to find out the effects of the surgical versus non‐surgical approach and, when surgery is used, which materials, devices or operative protocols are best for improving lesion healing and reducing patient discomfort.",10,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Humans; Periapical Periodontitis [surgery, *therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Retreatment; Root Canal Therapy [*methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD005511.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005511.pub3,Oral Health
