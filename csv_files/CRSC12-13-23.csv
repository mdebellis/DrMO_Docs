CD005971.PUB3,"Sharif, MO; Catleugh, M; Merry, A; Tickle, M; Dunne, SM; Brunton, P; Aggarwal, VR; Chong, LY",Replacement versus repair of defective restorations in adults: resin composite,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2014,"Abstract - Background Composite filling materials have been increasingly used for the restoration of posterior teeth in recent years as a tooth‐coloured alternative to amalgam. As with any filling material composites have a finite life‐span. Traditionally, replacement was the ideal approach to treat defective composite restorations, however, repairing composites offers an alternative more conservative approach to the tooth structure where restorations are partly still serviceable. Repairing the restoration has the potential of taking less time and may sometimes be performed without the use of local anaesthesia hence it may be less distressing for a patient when compared with replacement. Objectives To evaluate the effects of replacing (with resin composite) versus repair (with resin composite) in the management of defective resin composite dental restorations in permanent molar and premolar teeth. Search methods For the identification of studies relevant to this review we searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 24 July 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 6); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 24 July 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 24 July 2013); BIOSIS via Web of Knowledge (1969 to 24 July 2013); Web of Science (1945 to 24 July 2013); and OpenGrey (to 24 July 2013). Researchers, experts and organisations known to be involved in this field were contacted in order to trace unpublished or ongoing studies. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: randomised controlled trial (including split‐mouth studies), involving replacement and repair of resin composite restorations in adults with a defective molar restoration in a permanent molar or premolar teeth. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts for each article identified by the searches in order to decide whether the article was likely to be relevant. Full papers were obtained for relevant articles and both review authors studied these. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were to be followed for data synthesis. Main results The search strategy retrieved 298 potentially eligible studies, after de‐duplication. After examination of the titles and abstracts, full texts of potentially relevant studies were retrieved but none of the retrieved studies met the inclusion criteria of the review. Authors' conclusions There are no published randomised controlled trials relevant to this review question. There is therefore a need for methodologically sound randomised controlled trials that are reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement ( www.consort‐statement.org/ ). Further research also needs to explore qualitatively the views of patients on repairing versus replacement and investigate themes around pain, anxiety and distress, time and costs. Plain language summary Tooth‐coloured, non‐metallic fillings: is it better to repair or replace faulty non‐metallic fillings for adults? Review question Is it more effective to repair or replace faulty tooth‐coloured fillings (resin composite) placed in molar teeth towards the back of the mouth in adults? Background Fillings are used as part of general dental treatment to rebuild teeth after a patient develops tooth decay or damages the surface of their tooth in some way. Fillings also help to prevent further damage occurring (this can be through further tooth decay under the filling or from impact), but they must be maintained to ensure that the fillings continue to protect what is left of the original tooth. Tooth‐coloured filling materials have increasingly been used in many countries as an alternative to the more traditional amalgam or metallic fillings. As with any filling material these fillings have a limited life‐span and eventually problems will occur when they break down or become faulty. Traditionally faulty fillings have been replaced, however this approach may involve the loss of further bits of tooth as the cavity is emptied and re‐filled. An alternative approach is to repair the faulty filling. Repairing fillings may take less time, and as some repairs can be performed without the need to numb the area (local anaesthesia), a repair may be less distressing for the patient when compared with the option of replacing the filling. Issues such as pain, anxiety, distress, time and cost are important considerations for dentists as well as patients. This review aims to compare whether it is better to replace or repair resin composite fillings. The evidence for repair or replacement of amalgam fillings is contained in a separate review. Study characteristics This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, and the evidence is current up to 24 July 2013. Key results No trials were found that were suitable for inclusion in this review. Quality of the evidence Currently there is no evidence to support repairing or replacing resin composite fillings for adults. Further well‐conducted research is required before an evidence‐based recommendation can be supported.",2,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Dental Restoration Failure; Adult; Composite Resins [*therapeutic use]; Dental Prosthesis Repair [*methods]; Dental Restoration, Permanent [*methods]; Humans; Retreatment [methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD005971.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005971.pub3,Oral Health

However, there are concerns over the use of amalgam restorations (fillings) with regard to mercury release in the body and the environmental impact of mercury disposal. Dental composite resin materials are an aesthetic alternative to amalgam, and their mechanical properties have developed sufficiently to make them suitable for restoring posterior teeth. Nevertheless, composite resin materials may have potential for toxicity to human health and the environment. The United Nations Environment Programme has established the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which is an international treaty that aims ""to protect the [sic] human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds"". It entered into force in August 2017, and as of February 2021 had been ratified by 127 governments. Ratification involves committing to the adoption of at least two of nine proposed measures to phase down the use of mercury, including amalgam in dentistry. In light of this, we have updated a review originally published in 2014, expanding the scope of the review by undertaking an additional search for harms outcomes. Our review synthesises the results of studies that evaluate the long‐term effectiveness and safety of amalgam versus composite resin restorations, and evaluates the level of certainty we can have in that evidence. Objectives To examine the effects (i.e. efficacy and safety) of direct composite resin fillings versus amalgam fillings. Search methods An information specialist searched five bibliographic databases up to 16 February 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies Selection criteria To assess efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dental composite resin with amalgam restorations in permanent posterior teeth that assessed restoration failure or survival at follow‐up of at least three years. To assess safety, we sought non‐randomised studies in addition to RCTs that directly compared composite resin and amalgam restorative materials and measured toxicity, sensitivity, allergy, or injury. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included a total of eight studies in this updated review, all of which were RCTs. Two studies used a parallel‐group design, and six used a split‐mouth design. We judged all of the included studies to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding and issues related to unit of analysis. We identified one new trial since the previous version of this review (2014), as well as eight additional papers that assessed safety, all of which related to the two parallel‐group studies that were already included in the review. For our primary meta‐analyses, we combined data from the two parallel‐group trials, which involved 1645 composite restorations and 1365 amalgam restorations in 921 children. We found low‐certainty evidence that composite resin restorations had almost double the risk of failure compared to amalgam restorations (risk ratio (RR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 2.35; P < 0.001), and were at much higher risk of secondary caries (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.74; P < 0.001). We found low‐certainty evidence that composite resin restorations were not more likely to result in restoration fracture (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.64; P = 0.66). Six trials used a split‐mouth design. We considered these studies separately, as their reliability was compromised due to poor reporting, unit of analysis errors, and variability in methods and findings. Subgroup analysis showed that the findings were consistent with the results of the parallel‐group studies. Three trials investigated possible harms of dental restorations. Higher urinary mercury levels were reported amongst children with amalgam restorations in two trials, but the levels were lower than what is known to be toxic. Some differences between amalgam and composite resin groups were observed on certain measures of renal, neuropsychological, and psychosocial function, physical development, and postoperative sensitivity; however, no consistent or clinically important harms were found. We considered that the vast number of comparisons made false‐positive results likely. There was no evidence of differences between the amalgam and composite resin groups in neurological symptoms, immune function, and urinary porphyrin excretion. The evidence is of very low certainty, with most harms outcomes reported in only one trial. Authors' conclusions Low‐certainty evidence suggests that composite resin restorations may have almost double the failure rate of amalgam restorations. The risk of restoration fracture does not seem to be higher with composite resin restorations, but there is a much higher risk of developing secondary caries. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that there may be no clinically important differences in the safety profile of amalgam compared with composite resin dental restorations. This review supports the utility of amalgam restorations, and the results may be particularly useful in parts of the world where amalgam is still the material of choice to restore posterior teeth with proximal caries. Of note, however, is that composite resin materials have undergone important improvements in the years since the trials informing the primary analyses for this review were conducted. The global phase‐down of dental amalgam via the Minamata Convention on Mercury is an important consideration when deciding between amalgam and composite resin dental materials. The choice of which dental material to use will depend on shared decision‐making between dental providers and patients in the clinic setting, and local directives and protocols. Plain language summary Tooth‐colored resin fillings compared with amalgam fillings for permanent teeth at the back of the mouth Review question This review, carried out within Cochrane Oral Health, describes the effects of tooth‐coloured (composite resin) fillings compared with amalgam fillings when placed directly into cavities (holes) in permanent teeth in the back of the mouth. Background Traditionally, metal fillings made of a silver‐coloured material known as amalgam have been used to treat tooth decay in the back permanent teeth effectively and cheaply; however, due to unhappiness with their metallic look and concerns about the mercury they contain, they are being used less often, particularly in high‐income countries. The Minamata Convention on Mercury is a global agreement that has promoted a worldwide reduction in the use of mercury (including amalgam fillings) in order to reduce the impact of mercury on the environment. Tooth‐colored fillings made of a composite resin material have been used as an alternative to amalgam fillings. Initially, they were used only in the front teeth, but as their quality has improved, they have been used in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases until 16 February 2021 and found eight relevant studies. The studies evaluated 3285 composite fillings and 1955 amalgam fillings; however, it is unclear how many participants received these fillings. The exact age of participants was unclear in some studies, but the studies included both children and adults. The studies took place in the UK, the USA, Portugal, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Turkey. Participants in six studies received composite and amalgam fillings in different teeth (known as 'split‐mouth design'), whilst participants in the other two studies received either composite or amalgam fillings ('parallel‐group' design). Key results Our main analysis focused on the two parallel‐group studies that treated 921 children (aged 6 to 12 years) who had their teeth restored with amalgam (1365) or composite resin (1645) fillings. We found that composite resin fillings were significantly more likely to fail than amalgam fillings when used to fill cavities in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Tooth decay after a filling was placed (known as 'secondary caries') occurred more frequently with composite resin compared to amalgam fillings. There was no suggestion of a difference between the materials in the likelihood of filling breaking. Six of the trials used a 'split‐mouth' design, which means that each participant had both types of fillings in different teeth. These studies were less reliable, as they did not explain fully how they conducted the studies, and it was unclear how many people received the fillings. We analysed the split‐mouth studies separately from the parallel‐group studies, and undertook a statistical approach known as 'subgroup analysis'. This showed that the findings of these studies were compatible with the results from the two parallel‐group studies. Three studies reported negative side effects. Although we found that there were some possible side effects with each material used, this information is unreliable because the study authors carried out so many analyses that 'false positive' results were likely to be found. Overall, it seems that the materials may differ in terms of how safe they are, but the level of the differences identified in the studies may not be important. To summarise, we found that composite resin fillings may be almost twice as likely to fail compared with amalgam fillings when used for filling permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Composite fillings do not seem more likely to break, but do seem more likely than amalgam fillings to develop further tooth decay. The current evidence suggests there are no important differences in the safety of amalgam compared with composite resin dental fillings. Certainty of the evidence We judge the available evidence to be 'low certainty', which means that the results may change with future research. As the colour of the amalgam and composite resin fillings differed, it would not have been possible to 'blind' those involved in the study from knowing the treatment administered, so there was a high risk of bias in all of the included studies. In addition, the findings were imprecise and sometimes inconsistent, so we cannot be sure that the evidence is reliable.  Implications of the evidence Overall, the evidence suggests that amalgam restorations are effective, enduring, and safe, while composite resin restorations are more likely to fail and lead to secondary caries. However, the studies in this review were quite old, and composite resin materials have likely improved since the included studies were conducted. Patients and dental providers can discuss together which material they want to use when permanent teeth in the back of the mouth require fillings in the dental clinic. Governments around the world are trying to reduce the use of dental amalgam (according to the Minamata Convention on Mercury), and so each local area will have their own regulations and guidance.

CD007819.PUB3,"Pereira‐Cenci, T; Cenci, MS; Fedorowicz, Z; Azevedo, M",Antibacterial agents in composite restorations for the prevention of dental caries,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2013,"Abstract - Background Dental caries is a multifactorial disease in which the fermentation of food sugars by bacteria from the biofilm (dental plaque) leads to localised demineralisation of tooth surfaces, which may ultimately result in cavity formation. Resin composites are widely used in dentistry to restore teeth. These restorations can fail for a number of reasons, such as secondary caries, and restorative material fracture and other minor reasons. From these, secondary caries, which are caries lesions developed adjacent to restorations, is the main cause for restorations replacement. The presence of antibacterials in both the filling material and the bonding systems would theoretically be able to affect the initiation and progression of caries adjacent to restorations. This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2009. Objectives To assess the effects of antibacterial agents incorporated into composite restorations for the prevention of dental caries. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 23 July 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 6), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 23 July 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 23 July 2013). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register ( http://clinicaltrials.gov ), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( www.controlled‐trials.com ) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry platform ( www.who.int/trialsearch ) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing resin composite restorations containing antibacterial agents with composite restorations not containing antibacterial agents. Data collection and analysis Two review authors conducted screening of studies in duplicate and independently, and although no eligible trials were identified, the two authors had planned to extract data independently and assess trial quality using standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies. Main results We retrieved 308 references to studies, none of which matched the inclusion criteria for this review and all of which were excluded. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials on the effects of antibacterial agents incorporated into composite restorations for the prevention of dental caries. The absence of high level evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention emphasises the need for well designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled clinical trials. Thus, conclusions remain the same as the previously published review, with no included clinical trials. Plain language summary Use of antibacterial substances in resin‐based fillings to prevent further tooth decay (next to the filling) developing after treatment Review question The main question addressed by this review is how effective the use of antibacterial agents in composite (resin‐based, tooth‐coloured) fillings might be in preventing the development of further decay either underneath or next to the filling (secondary caries). Background When tooth decay (caries) has caused a cavity in a tooth a range of materials can be used as fillings. These include resin composite, glass ionomer cement, amalgam and compomers. Tooth decay that may develop next to or underneath, a filling at a later stage is a common concern in dental practice and may reduce the life span of these fillings. It is thought that including a substance that kills and prevents the growth of bacterial (also known as an antibacterial agent) in some dental fillings, for example resin composites, could help prevent the development of this secondary caries. Study characteristics The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 23 July 2013. The review authors have not found any trials to support or disprove the effectiveness of antibacterial agents incorporated into fillings to prevent further tooth decay. Key results No trials were found that were suitable for inclusion in this review.

CD010526.PUB3,"Schenkel, AB; Veitz‐Keenan, A",Dental cavity liners for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2019,"Abstract - Background Resin‐based composite (RBC) is currently accepted as a viable material for the restoration of caries for posterior permanent teeth requiring surgical treatment. Despite the fact that the thermal conductivity of the RBC restorative material closely approximates that of natural tooth structure, postoperative hypersensitivity is sometimes still an issue. Dental cavity liners have historically been used to protect the pulp from the toxic effects of some dental restorative materials and to prevent the pain of thermal conductivity by placing an insulating layer between restorative material and the remaining tooth structure. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2016. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of using dental cavity liners in the placement of Class I and Class II resin‐based composite posterior restorations in permanent teeth in children and adults. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 12 November 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library (searched 12 November 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 12 November 2018), Embase Ovid (1980 to 12 November 2018) and LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; 1982 to 12 November 2018). We searched  ClinicalTrials.gov  and the  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of the use of liners under Class I and Class II posterior resin‐based composite restorations in permanent teeth (in both adults and children). We included both parallel and split‐mouth designs. Data collection and analysis We utilized standard methodological procedures prescribed by Cochrane for data collection and analysis. Two review authors screened the search results and assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion against the review inclusion criteria. We conducted risk of bias assessments and data extraction independently and in duplicate. Where information was unclear we contacted study authors for clarification. Main results Eight studies, recruiting over 700 participants, compared the use of dental cavity liners to no liners for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations. Seven studies evaluated postoperative hypersensitivity measured by various methods. All studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. There was inconsistent evidence regarding postoperative hypersensitivity (either measured using cold response or patient‐reported), with a benefit shown at some, but not all, time points (low‐quality evidence). Four trials measured restoration longevity. Two of the studies were judged to be at high risk and two at unclear risk of bias. No difference in restoration failure rates were shown at 1 year follow‐up, with no failures reported in either group for three of the four studies; the fourth study had a risk ratio (RR) 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.00) (low‐quality evidence). Three studies evaluated restoration longevity at 2 years follow‐up and, again, no failures were shown in either group. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions There is inconsistent, low‐quality evidence regarding the difference in postoperative hypersensitivity subsequent to placing a dental cavity liner under Class I and Class II posterior resin‐based composite restorations in permanent posterior teeth in adults or children 15 years or older. Furthermore, no evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in the longevity of restorations placed with or without dental cavity liners. Plain language summary Dental cavity liners under tooth‐colored resin fillings placed into permanent teeth in the back of the mouth Review question This review was conducted to assess the effects of using liners under tooth‐colored resin fillings in cavities on the biting surface (Class I) and the biting surface and side(s) (Class II) of permanent teeth in the back of the mouth in children and adults. Background Tooth decay is the most common disease affecting children and adults worldwide. If left untreated, acid produced by bacteria in the dental plaque or biofilm forms cavities or holes in the teeth. A number of techniques and a variety of materials can be used to restore or fill teeth affected by decay. One of these materials is tooth‐colored, resin‐based composite or RBC. This material is increasingly used as an alternative to amalgam (a mixture of mercury and metal alloy particles). Since the 19th century liners have often been placed in cavities in the teeth under the filling material. The liners are thought to protect the living pulp of the tooth from filling materials themselves and also from their potential to allow more heat or cold through than the natural tooth would. Although RBC filling materials are thought to be similar to the natural material of teeth in terms of how they conduct heat, sensitivity to temperature change is sometimes still an issue for people after treatment. Study characteristics The evidence in this review, carried out by authors from Cochrane Oral Health, is up to date as of 12 November 2018. Eight studies, with over 700 participants, were included. Two studies were conducted in the USA, two in Thailand, two in Germany and one each in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The studies compared the use of liners under tooth‐colored resin fillings (RBC) in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth to no liners for Class I and Class II fillings. One of the two studies in the USA took place in dental practices, the others in university‐based dental schools. All participants were over 15 years of age. Key results Very little evidence was found to show that a liner under Class I and II RBC fillings in permanent teeth in the back of the mouth reduced sensitivity in adults or children 15 years or older. No evidence was found to show that there was any difference in the length of time fillings lasted when placed with or without a cavity liner. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Quality of evidence The body of evidence identified in this review does not allow for robust conclusions about the effects of dental cavity liners. The quality of the evidence identified in this review is low and there is a lack of confidence in the effect estimates. Furthermore, no evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in how long restorations last when placed with or without dental cavity liners.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Composite Resins; *Dental Restoration, Permanent [adverse effects, classification]; *Thermal Conductivity; Adolescent; Adult; Dental Caries [classification, surgery]; Dental Cavity Lining [*instrumentation]; Dental Restoration Failure [statistics & numerical data]; Dentin Sensitivity [epidemiology, etiology, *prevention & control]; Humans; Pain, Postoperative [*prevention & control]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD010526.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010526.pub3,Oral Health
