Methods Data on teaching, including operative techniques applied in the placement of posterior composites, were collected by means of a 25-item validated questionnaire sent to the Heads of Department of Operative/Restorative Dentistry at all 38 dental schools in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Responses were compiled in Excel and analysed. Results Thirty-three schools responded to the survey, resulting in a response rate of 87 %. All dental schools indicated teaching of 2- and 3-surface posterior composite restorations. About one third only of the preclinical teaching is assigned to teaching posterior composite restorations, while the vast majority of posterior restorations placed by students in their clinical instruction are composite (89.6 ± 9.3 %). Most dental schools teach few contraindications to posterior composites, except for adverse reactions such as allergies. All dental schools consider moisture control to be important, while approaches to the management of exposed dentine differ. Conclusions The teaching of the placement of posterior composite restorations is common to all the dental schools in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland which participated in the present study. Most aspects of the teaching were found to be consistent amongst the schools. However, marked variations were observed in respect of operative techniques for the placement of posterior composites. Clinical significance Graduates from dental schools in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland may be found to have received theoretical, preclinical, and clinical instruction in posterior composites, but do show some variation in approach to the management of exposed dentine.","","Education, Minimally invasive dentistry, Operative dentistry, Posterior composites, Teaching","",""

The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of partial indirect restorations with DME and compare the effects of selected baseline variables on the (quality of) survival of the restorations. Methods All teeth that were restored in combination with indirect restorations and DME between 2007 and 2016 were eligible for inclusion. Overall cumulative survival rates were calculated (Kaplan–Meier estimates) and compared among subsets of variables. Qualitative evaluation of all surviving restorations was performed using the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria using Chi-square tests. Results A total of 197 indirect restorations in 120 patients could be included. Restorations or teeth presenting with secondary caries, fracture of the restoration/tooth, debonding of the indirect restoration, root caries, severe periodontal breakdown or pulpal necrosis were considered as absolute failures (n = 8) leading to an overall cumulative survival rate of 95.9% (SE 2.9%) up to 12 years, with an average evaluation time of 57.7 months. Some indication of degradation of the restorations was seen over time. Indirect composite restorations showed more degradation compared to ceramic restorations (p = 0.000). More wear of the antagonist was observed when teeth were opposed to ceramic restorations (p = 0.04). Endodontic treatment negatively impacted the occurrence of fracture of restorations and teeth (p = 0.000).

Methods Inclusion criteria for this multicenter clinical retrospective study were fully or partially edentulous patients who had been treated with a sleeveless and keyless guided implant surgery system (R2Gate®, Megagen), and who had been rehabilitated with fixed restorations, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. All surgeries and prosthetic procedures were conducted following the same protocol, and data were obtained from the patients’ medical records. The outcomes were the fit and stability of the surgical guide, any intra-operative and immediate post-operative complications, any biologic and prosthetic complications that occurred during the 1-year follow-up period, implant survival, and prosthetic success. Results Sixty patients were selected for the installation of 124 implants, through a guided procedure: 66 sleeveless, keyless surgical guides were manufactured. The incidence of immediate intra-operative (lack of space: 12.1%; lack of implant stability 2.6%) and immediate post-operative (pain and discomfort: 6.6%; mild swelling 3.3%) complications was low. In total, 112/124 implants (90.3%) were successfully placed with a guided procedure, in 52 patients; among them, 82 (73.2%) were placed with a flapless procedure. Thirty fixtures supported single crowns (SCs), 42 fixed partial dentures (FPDs) and 52 full-arch (FA) restorations. Sixty-two fixed prosthetic restorations (30 SCs, 22 FPDs and 10 FAs) were delivered; among these restorations, 15 (24.1%) were subjected to immediate functional loading. All implants (100%) survived. Two implants had peri‑implant mucositis (1.6%), two SCs had abutment screw loosenings (1.6%), two FAs and one FPD had ceramic chipping/fracture (2.4%), for an overall prosthetic success amounting to 88.7%. Conclusions Within the limits of this study, this novel guided surgery system appeared to be clinically reliable; further studies are needed to confirm these results.

Since most authors found the loss of retention of refitable post and cores as the most common cause of failure, it is impossible to draw a conclusion on tooth survival on the results of those studies. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to improve the clinical evidence on the survival of teeth treated with post and cores on a large number of cases over a long observation period. Materials and methods 735 patients were treated with 1053 post and cores in the observation period (2004–2022) and could be included in the study. The patient files were analysed due to the parameters: Type of covering prosthetic restoration, location, type of tooth, luting material, post and core material, bone attachment and therapist. The survival probability was assessed using Kaplan-Meyer analysis. Cox regression was used to assess possible multifactorial influences. Results The overall average survival time until necessary extraction of a tooth restored with a post and core was 11.74 years. A root fracture in primary crown retained removeable partial dentures (RPDs) during the first five years was the most common reason for extraction in this study. A significant influence on the survival time of teeth restored with post and cores was found for the type of covering restoration, bone attachment, age of the patient and post and core material. Conclusions Post and core restored teeth should be avoided as abutments for primary crown retained RPDs.

This STL file was exported into a nesting software (PreForm) and 3-unit interim fixed dental prostheses with 5 different orientations (0°, 30°, 45°, 90°, and 150°) were printed by using a 3-dimensional (3D) printing interim resin (Temporary CB) (n = 10). The same STL file was also used to mill polymethymethacrylate (DuoCAD) 3-unit interim fixed dental prostheses as the control group (n = 10). All specimens were cemented onto cobalt-chromium test models representing a maxillary first premolar and first molar tooth with a long-term temporary cement (DentoTemp), and subjected to thermomechanical aging (120,000 cycles, 1.6 Hz, 50 N, 5–55 °C).

Methods Thirty-five fractured single crowns were retrieved from dental practices (bi-layered, n = 15; monolithic, n = 20). These were analyzed according to fractographic procedures by optical and scanning electron microscopy to identify fracture patterns and fracture origins. The fracture origins were closely examined. The crown margin thickness and axial wall height were measured. Results Three types of failure modes were observed: total fractures, marginal semilunar fractures, and incisal chippings. Most of the crowns (23) had fracture origins at the crown margin and seven of them had defects in the fracture origin area. The exact fracture origin was not possible to identify due to missing parts in four crowns. The crown wall thickness was 20% thinner and wall height 30% shorter in the fracture origin area compared to the opposite side. Conclusions The findings in this study show that fractography can reveal fracture origins and fracture modes of both monolithic and bi-layered dental zirconia.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of SE vs. NS combined with direct pulp capping using MTA vs. CH. Methods A mixed public-private-payer perspective within German healthcare was applied. We modeled a permanent molar with a deep carious lesion and a vital asymptomatic pulp. The lesion was treated by SE/NS and, in case of exposure, direct pulp capping using MTA/CH. The tooth was followed over the lifetime of an initially 30-year-old patient using Markov-models, informed by pairwise and Bayesian network meta-analyses and further data sources. The primary health outcome was tooth-retention time. Costs were derived from German fee item catalogues, combined with micro-costing. Monte-Carlo micro-simulation was performed, and uncertainty introduced via probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses. Value-of-information-analysis (VOI) was performed to quantify the value of further research. Results SE and, in case of pulp exposure, MTA had a high chance (>95 %) of being cost-effective, with teeth being retained for 37.37 years at costs of 2140 Euro in mean. Alternative strategies were both more costly and less effective; this ranking was robust in sensitivity analyses. The VOI was 1.18 Euro per treated case and 12.86 million Euro on population-level. Conclusion Selective carious tissue removal and, in case of pulp exposure, direct capping with MTA was the most cost-effective strategy. Clinical significance Avoiding pulp exposure was more relevant for cost-effectiveness than how the exposed pulp was managed. Overall differences remain limited, though, and dentists may want to tailor treatment strategies according to their expertise and patients’ expectations.","","Calcium hydroxide, Dental caries, Direct capping, Health economics, MTA, Selective carious tissue removal","",""

Methods One hundred and forty-one specimens (10 × 10 × 1.5 mm3) were fabricated from KATANATM zirconia blocks and contaminated with human saliva or sheep blood. Six cleaning measures were examined: water-rinse, H3PO4, 5.25% NaOCl, ZirCleanTM, Ivoclean and KATANATM Cleaner. Tensile bond strength was evaluated for 13 groups (N=10): six cleaning measures against two contaminations (12 experimental groups) and one uncontaminated control group. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the control and water-rinsed specimen surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to identify carbon (C1s), nitrogen (N1s), phosphorous (P2p) and zirconium (Zr3d) peaks, from which the elemental ratios C/Zr, N/Zr and P/Zr were calculated. Results Although water-rinsing removed most of the contaminants from the zirconia surface, bond strength of resin cement was significantly lower compared with the control. Phosphoric acid was ineffective and NaOCl was less reliable in restoring bond strength. The three commercial cleaners (ZirCleanTM, Ivoclean, KATANATM Cleaner) out-performed the other cleaning measures and restored the bond strength of resin cement to zirconia except for the use of ZircleanTM on blood-contaminated surfaces. N/Zr decreased for all cleaned specimens and P/Zr ratio increased for phosphoric acid and KATANATM Cleaner groups. Differences in elemental ratios could indicate different cleaning mechanisms for the zirconia cleaners. Conclusion All three commercial zirconia cleaners are effective in decontaminating saliva-contaminated or blood-contaminated zirconia and increasing the bond strength of resin cement to contaminated zirconia.

Materials and methods We selected 32 extracted maxillary first molars and divided them into four groups according to the post-core system: traditional casting titanium (Ti) post-cores (TC group); Ti post-cores fabricated with selective laser melting (SLM group); CAD/CAM glass fiber post-cores of the split type (CCS group); and prefabricated glass fiber posts and composite resin cores (PF group). The internal adaptation was analyzed with microcomputed tomography. Teeth were restored with monolithic zirconia crowns and subjected to thermocycling and cyclic loading. A load was applied consistently along the long axis of the tooth until fracture to record the fracture resistance and pattern. For the statistical analysis, one- and two-way analyses of variance, Tukey's post hoc and chi-square tests were performed to compare the differences among the groups. Results The CCS, TC, and SLM groups exhibited similar internal adaptations across all sections (P < 0.05). The FP group showed good fit with the root canals in the apical and middle sections but a poor fit with those in the cervical section. The fracture resistance was higher in the CCS, TC, and SLM groups compared to the PF group (P < 0.05). The proportions of restorable fractures in the CCS and PF groups were 62.5% and 50%, respectively. Unrestorable fractures were more frequent in the TC and SLM groups at frequencies of 100% and 87.5%, respectively. Conclusion The internal adaptation and fracture resistance of the CCS group were similar to those of the TC and SLM groups, and the fracture pattern was mostly restorable, thus meeting the clinical requirements for molar post-core restorations.

The specimens were imaged and measured using microcomputed tomography (microCT) at 7 time points: pre-demineralisation, after demineralisation for two weeks, immediately after treatment, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment. The 3-month group was evaluated with a light microscope, attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope (SEM)/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Data were analysed by Dunn's test and Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction for microCT, and Kruskal–Wallis test and two-way analysis of variance for EDS characterisation. Results MicroCT images showed high mineral density beneath dentine lesions in Safo+Fuji. The mineral density at 600 μm in Safo+Fuji increased significantly over time, while Safo showed an opposite trend (adjusted p<0.005). In Safo+Fuji, EDS revealed significantly high energy of fluorine (p<0.05, at 300 μm) and a tendency towards high energy of calcium (p>0.05).

In the first treatment group, 20 μL of conditioner was applied to demineralized shallow (n = 3) and deep (n = 3) lesion specimens for 20 s before restoration with glass ionomer cement (RMGIC). For the PILP cement treatment group, cement was applied onto the wet surface of the demineralized specimen for both shallow (n = 3) and deep (n = 3) artificial lesions after the application of the conditioner and before the final restoration. Sample groups were compared to RMGIC restoration, for both shallow and deep lesions (n = 3 each) and treatments in PILP-solution (n = 3 for deep lesions) without restoration for 4 weeks. All of the restored specimens were immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution for 2 weeks and 4 weeks for shallow and deep lesions respectively to allow for remineralization. The artificial lesion specimens were evaluated for changes in the nanomechanical profile (E-modulus and hardness) using nanoindentation. Shallow lesions were analyzed by SEM under vacuum for changes in morphology caused by PILP treatments. Also, a pilot study on human third molars with moderate lesions in dentin (n = 3) was initiated to test the efficacy of treatments in natural lesions based on mineral densities using microcomputed tomography (μCT) at 0, 1, and 3 months. Results This study showed that functional remineralization of artificial lesions using PILP-releasing restoratives occurred, indicated by an increase of the elastic modulus in shallow lesions and in the middle zone of deep artificial lesions. The mechanical improvement was significant when compared to RMGIC restoration without pAsp (P < 0.05). Nonetheless, recovery across artificial lesions was most significant when specimens were immersed into PILP-solution with restorative (P < 0.01). Furthermore, natural lesions increased in mineral volume content to a higher degree when the restorative treatment included the PILP-method (P < 0.05). However, none of the natural lesions recovered to full mineral degree regardless of the treatments. Clinical significance/Conclusion These findings indicate the benefit of PILP applications in the functional repair of dentin caries and illustrate the challenge to integrate the PILP-method into a restorative approach in minimally invasive dental procedures.","","Dental materials, Dentin caries, Polymer induced liquid precursor, Remineralization, Collagen","",""

Data In vitro studies that compared the antibacterial effects of resin-based restorative dental materials with and without antibacterial additives were screened. Risk bias was assessed, and the following data were extracted: antibacterial additive, parental dental material, curing mode, bacterial growth outcome assessment, samples used as a substrate for bacterial growth, inoculum complexity, and culture time as an indicator of biofilm maturity. Source Arksey and O’Malley’s five stages framework using Medline (OVID), EMBASE, and Scopus (Elsevier) databases guided this review. Study selection From 6503 studies initially identified, 348 studies were considered eligible for full-text screening, and 153 were included for data extraction. Almost all studies have a high sampling bias related to both sample size and blindness. Quaternary ammonium monomers were the most investigated additive (45 %), and the most prevailing parental material was resin composite (49 %). There was extensive methodological heterogeneity among the studies for outcome assessment with the majority using resin composite disks (78 %), mono-species Streptococcus mutans as the inoculum (54 %), and a relatively short period of biofilm growth (≤24 h). Conclusion The findings herein present the urgent need for improved biological efficacy studies in this important and exciting field. There is a need for efforts to improve study designs to mimic the oral environment in vivo and to develop standardized methods to help understand and optimize these materials. Clinical significance Most studies that incorporate antibacterial additives into resin-based materials claim promising results by bacterial reduction. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to significant variation in the methods applied for quantifying bacterial growth, the frequent lack of complexity in the biofilms, and the often-short duration of biofilm growth.","","Dental materials, Antibacterial, Polymers, Resin composites, Oral biofilm, Caries inhibition","",""

Material and methods A prefabricated abutment was digitized by using a laboratory scanner (E4 Lab Scanner) and a complete-coverage maxillary first premolar crown was designed (Dental Designer). Forty crowns were fabricated either by 3D printing (Saremco Print Crowntec, SP) or milling (Brilliant Crios, BC; Vita Enamic, VE; Cerasmart 270, CS) (n = 10). Baseline marginal gap values were evaluated by measuring 60 predetermined points on an abutment (15 points for each side) with a stereomicroscope at ×40 magnification. Marginal gap values were reevaluated after adhesive cementation. Load-to-fracture test was performed by using a universal testing machine. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of material type and cementation on marginal gap values. While Tukey HSD tests were used to compare the materials’ marginal gap values before and after cementation, the effect of cementation on marginal gap values within each material was analyzed by using paired samples t-tests. Fracture resistance data were analyzed by using 1-way ANOVA (α=0.05). Results Material type and cementation significantly affected marginal gap values (P < .001). Regardless of cementation, SP had the lowest marginal gap values (P < .001), while the differences among milled crowns were nonsignificant (P ≥ .14). Cementation significantly increased the marginal gap values (P < .001). Material type did not affect fracture resistance values (F = 1.589, P = .209). Conclusion Implant-supported 3D-printed composite crowns showed higher marginal adaptation compared with the milled crowns before and after cementation. In addition, all crowns endured similar forces before fracture.","","3D-printing, Fracture resistance, Implant-supported crown, Marginal gap","",""

The internal walls reached the inner quarter of dentin, but with a radiographically detectable zone of firm dentin remaining. The pulpal protection using a layer of glass ionomer composite liner (Ionoseal, Voco) was applied in just one preparation.

Methods A total of 95 posterior monolithic zirconia tooth-elements in 45 patients were evaluated, 85 on implants and 10 on natural teeth, and 20.3% of restorations being fixed partial dentures (FPDs). Occlusal contact point areas were determined and half of those areas were left unglazed and just polished. Restorations were clinically evaluated following criteria of the World Dental Federation and antagonistic teeth were examined at each evaluation time. Wear ex vivo analyses using SEM and 3D laser profilometry were performed at baseline and after 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years respectively, temporarily removing the prostheses. Results The Kaplan-Meier survival rate of restorations was 93.3% (100% for FPDs) and the success rate was 81.8%, with 4 abutment debondings, 3 tooth-supported crown debondings (provisional cement use), 1 restoration fracture, 1 minor chipping, 1 core fracture, 1 root fracture, and 2 implant losses. 80% of catastrophic failures occurred in patients with clinical signs of bruxism (61.7% of patients). Complications were also observed on antagonistic teeth (3 catastrophic failures). Clinical evaluation of the restorations showed good results from the aesthetic, functional, and biological perspective. Zirconia wear was inferior to 15 μm, while glaze wear was observed on all occlusal contact areas after 1 year. Conclusions Monolithic zirconia FPDs are promising but the failure rate of single-unit restorations was not as high as expected in this sample including patients with bruxism clinical signs. Clinical significance Within study limitations, FPDs showed excellent short-term results but further research is needed for single-unit restorations considering samples, which do not exclude bruxers. The weak link is the restoration support or the antagonist tooth, one hypothesis being that zirconia stiffness and lack of resilience do not promote occlusal stress damping.","","Dental prosthesis, Zirconia, Computer-Aided design/Computer-Aided manufacturing, Wear","",""

Results The in situ bacterial colonization, in terms of both total bacterial biomass and bacterial community composition, was similar among the restorative materials tested. The microbiota of early plaque comprised similar “core microbiota”, which were dominated by species within the genera of Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Gemella, and Prevotella, regardless of the type of underlying surface.

The implications of this knowledge were used to justify how these defects are managed clinically. Data, Sources and Study selection Literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for a narrative review on fracture mechanics of crown and root dentine as well as the clinical management of cracked teeth and teeth with vertical root fracture. Conclusions Although dentine is tougher and less brittle than enamel, it's facture toughness is considerably lower than most ductile metals. Because the initiation toughness of dentine is very low, cracks initiate from incipient damage under low stress While crack toughening mechanisms exist that enable dentine to resist crack extension, these mechanisms are often inadequate for protecting dentine from crack propagation that ultimately leads to catastrophic failure. Additional factors such as ageing also reduces the resistance of dentine to crack growth. Because dentine cracks are eventually filled with bacteria biofilms upon exposure to oral fluids, they enable rapid bacteria ingress into the dental pulp via open dentinal tubules. To date, treatment options for cracked teeth are limited. While most teeth with vertical root fracture are recommended for extraction, new strategies have been reported that appeared to achieve short-term success in preserving these teeth. Clinical Significance Current strategies for the management for dentine cracks and fractures are limited and their long-term effectiveness remain uncertain. Understanding the characteristics, toughening mechanism and weakening factors of tooth cracks is helpful in designing better treatment.","","Biomechanical, Crack, Fracture toughness, Management, Vertical root fracture","",""

Clinical performance was assessed after 6 and 12-months using the modified United States Public Health Services criteria. The trial was registered at Clinical Trial.gov with a registration number (NCT03881020). Treatment time for each restoration was recorded, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the log-rank test were performed (p<0.05) and cost effectiveness was measured at the end of the study. Results Both techniques showed comparable clinical performance and the mean survival time was 11.8 and 11.6 months for SMART and ART restorations respectively with no detected significant differences (p=0.416).

Materials and Methods Fifty human molars with dentine carious lesions were excavated selectively using CarisolvTM gel and then connected to simulated pulpal pressure system. Teeth were divided randomly into five groups based on the tested materials: EXP-SE, EXP-ER, a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC), a three-step adhesive system (OPT) and a universal adhesive applied in SE mode (UA-SE). The specimens were submitted to different analytical tests (μTBS, SEM fractographic analysis and dye-enhanced confocal microscopy) at baseline (T0) and after 1 year (T1). Results At T0 there was no difference in bond strength between the tested materials (p>0.05). At T1, EXP-SE and EXP-ER were the only materials to show no significant reduction in bond strength (p<0.05). The SEM showed a clear presence of minerals deposited on the dentine surface after bonding in the EXP-SE and EXP-ER groups. The specimens restored with RMGIC showed no exposure of the dentine surface after failure. The OPT and UA-SE specimens showed clear signs of degradation at the interface. Confocal microscopy imaged mineral precipitation at the interface of the EXP groups. Conclusion Conventional adhesives may have inadequate bonding performance with evident degradation at the dentine-bonded interface over time. Although the RMGIC may present a drop in bond strength after prolonged storage, the bonding interface may result less affected by degradation over time. Innovative ion-releasing adhesives may remineralise the caries-affected dentine and achieve a stable bond over time.

This study tests the antibacterial properties of a novel bulk-fill flowable composite (Infinx™, Nobio™ Ltd.) containing quaternary ammonium silica (QASi) filler particles. Methods Infinix™ was tested in-vitro by the direct contact test (DCT), using E. faecalis or whole saliva as inoculum. A similar formula composite without QASi served as a control. In addition, composite test samples were polymerized on three volunteers' intact buccal enamel surfaces of mandibular first premolars in a split-mouth design experiment. Traditional composite served as control (Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable, 3M). Bacterial viability on the composite surfaces weres assessed ex-vivo microscopically six months later, using a fluorescent dead/live stain. Images of each bacterial sample were taken using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i), and further live/total cell analysis was performed using ImageJ software. Results Following direct contact with one week of aged Infinix, more than 1 million E. faecalis bacteria were killed. Similarly, when using the saliva as inoculum, no single microorganism survived. Six-month in-vivo experiments supported these results by showing a reduction of 54%, 30% and 28% in live/total number of bacteria ratio retrieved from antibacterial composite vs. the control in volunteers #1, #2, #3 respectively. Conclusion Within the limitations of the experimental design, the present study suggest that antibacterial activity of quaternary ammonium silica particles (QASi) is comparable to that of previously described quaternary ammonium polyethyleneimine particles (QPEI). In addition, whole saliva bacteria are effectively killed by QASi-containing composite in-vitro and in-vivo, for a period of six month at least. Long-term full-scale clinical study is needed to confirm the findings of the present study and their implication on maintaining health balance.

All intact enamel surfaces were preserved (micro-invasive approach). DFRC-FPD were reinforced by fiber-splints with semi polymer network matrices (Everstick C + B©). At the last follow-up DFRC-FPD were considered successful if they were still in function without any need of therapy. DFRC-FPD were considered as survived if they were repaired or replaced.

Methods Eight intrabony periodontal defects were enrolled in the present investigation. CBCT and intraoral scans (IOS) were taken prior to and 6 months after periodontal regenerative surgery. Utilizing a semi-automatic segmentation method 3D models were generated from CBCT scans using an open-source radiographic image processing software (3D Slicer). Hybrid models were acquired with the superimposition and subsequent free-form surface modeling of the segmented CBCT model and the IOS. Hybrid models visualizing all relevant anatomical structures separately (alveolar bone, teeth, soft tissues) were used to plan each step of the procedure virtually prior to surgery.  Superimposition of the pre- and post-operative CBCT scans was performed to validate volumetric and 3D morphological alterations.

Methods The study involved 76 dentists from private and hospital practices. Assessments of successes and failures of previous restorations used a simplified rating with FDI criteria 3 to 8, 11, 12, and 14. The results were examined versus tooth location, number of restored surfaces, type of restoration, and filling material. Results The dentists examined 4,612 dental restorations, of which 4,185 direct fillings mainly with resin composite materials (2,555). Of all restorations, 2,048 (44.4%) were considered as failures, of which 1,489 had one or two criteria for ‘clinically unsatisfactory/poor restoration’. As simplified, the esthetic criterion ‘color match’ was the most frequent criterion for failure (912 cases). The rate of restoration failures was found associated with the number of surfaces restored and the use of glass-ionomer cement. Results are not comparable with others obtained with original FDI criteria. Conclusions Assessing dental restorations with the original FDI criteria leads generally to much more failure statements than practitioners’ decisions to reintervene. Though requiring some adjustment (e.g., regarding ‘color match’), the simplified assessment proved convenient and amenable to standardization. Clinical Significance Regardless of the type of practice, selecting, understanding, and optimal interpreting of FDI criteria for failure is essential to help practitioners faced with daily dilemmas of replacement vs. repair of failed dental restorations.

After replacement of old fillings, no-prep Vita Enamic restorations (posterior restorations and palatal veneers) were bonded within 24 h. Direct composites were performed to mask the buccal joint on anterior teeth. Maxillo-facial physiotherapy was performed. Restorations were evaluated following World Dental Federation criteria. Treatment influence on Oral-Health-Impact-Profile-49 (OHIP-49) score was assessed. Results Tooth wear etiology was related to soft drink consumption and bruxism. Mean VDO increase was 5.09 ± 0.85 mm on the incisal pin. The mean restoration thickness on molars was 0.55 ± 0.21 mm, and the lowest was 0.11 mm. 2-year survival rate of restorations was 100 % and success rate was 93.5 %, with 11 minor chippings and one debonding.

The flexural strength, FS, and modulus, E, were measured with a span of 12 mm (NIST) or 20 mm (ISO). A fractographic analysis determined the origin of fracture. One and multiple-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc tests (α = 0.05), Weibull statistics and Pearson correlation analysis were used for data analysis.

Methods The novel protocol consists of (1) 3D data acquisition, with an intraoral scanner (IOS) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT); (2) application of AI for CBCT segmentation to obtain standard tessellation language (STL) models and automatic alignment with IOS models; (3) loading of selected STL models within the AR system and surgical planning with holograms; (4) surgical guide design with open-source computer-assisted-design (CAD) software; and (5) surgery on the patient. Results This novel protocol is effective and time-efficient when used for planning simple cases of static guided implant surgery in the partially edentulous patient. The clinician can plan the implants in an authentic 3D environment, without using any radiological guided surgery software. The precision of implant placement looks clinically acceptable, with minor deviations. Conclusions AI and AR technologies can be successfully used in guided implant surgery for authentic 3D planning that may replace conventional software. However, further clinical studies are needed to validate this protocol. Statement of clinical relevance The combined use of AI and AR may change the perspectives of modern guided implant surgery for authentic 3D planning that may replace conventional software.","","Artificial intelligence, Augmented reality, Guided implant surgery planning","",""

Methods A total of 48 indirect resin composite (Estenia; n = 24) and ceramic laminate veneers (IPS Empress Esthetic; n = 24) were placed on maxillary anterior teeth. Veneer preparations with incisal overlap were performed using a mock up technique. Survival of the restoration was considered the primary outcome measure and reported using Kaplan-Meier statistics and survival curves compared by means of Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) test. After luting, restorations were evaluated by calibrated operators at baseline and every year thereafter, using modified USPHS criteria and compared by means of Mann-Whitney U test. Results In total, 6 failures were observed, consisting of debonding (n = 3) and fracture (n = 3), all in the group of the indirect resin composite laminate veneers. Cumulative chance on survival after 10 years of the indirect resin composite and ceramic veneers was 75% (se 3,8%) and 100% respectively (p = 0.013).

Methods Posterior dental cavities of 72 participants (n = 236), with a cavity depth of at least 3 mm, were randomly divided into four groups. The restorations were bonded using either the Tetric N-Bond ER or Tetric N-Bond SE. The composite resin Tetric N-Ceram Bulk-Fill was placed either IF or using BF. Two experienced and calibrated examiners evaluated the restorations using FDI criteria in the baseline and after 12, 24 and 36-month. The statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon Signed rank test (α = 0.05) Results After 36-month, 14, 21 and 33 restorations showed minor fractures, marginal desadaptation and color mismatch, respectively (p > 0.05).

Methods Participants were randomized to one of three different types of implant-abutment interface designs [Conical (CI), flat-to-flat (FI), and Platform Switched (PS)]. Implants and provisional crowns with prefabricated titanium abutments were placed 5 months following extraction and/or ridge augmentation. Permanent ceramic crowns with zirconia abutments were placed after 12 weeks. To assess PROs, appearance and inflammation questionnaires were completed from provisional crown placement to the 3-year follow-up. Results Tooth appearance at the 3-year follow-up revealed a difference amongst CI, FI and PS implants (p=0.049; Kruskal-Wallis test). PS was rated better than FI (p=0.047) at 1 year for appearance of soft-tissue and satisfaction with colour. There were no differences for self-consciousness, smile and pain/discomfort while eating/hard food items. Conclusions Although participants tended to rate the health of mucosa around PS implants as slighty better than the other two implant systems, the differences were minimal and inconsistent. Thus, patient satisfaction in terms self-perceived gingival health and esthetics was high for all 3 systems tested, suggesting that patients are unable to detect mucosal inflammation. Clinical Significance Patients find it difficult to perceive mucosal inflammation; hence, it is recommended that patients attend implant follow-up visits, even if they do not perceive inflammation.

Materials and methods The study sample included 34 patients presenting 34 premolars in need of prosthetic rehabilitation: a total of 68 temporary crowns were manufactured, 34 of which milled and 34 printed. Immediately after manufacturing, the milled and printed provisionals were scanned with a desktop scanner (E1, 3Shape) to obtain STL files, that were superimposed to the original CAD design in order to identify the occlusal trueness (Analysis A). A second occlusal comparison was performed by scanning both kind of provisional after being placed intraorally with Trios scanner (3 Shape); intraoral scans were obtained in order to compare STL files of provisionals before and after occlusal adjustments (Analysis B).  The occlusal trueness was identified at three reference points, P1 (vestibular cusp), P2 (palatal / lingual cusp), P3 (central fossa). The statistical analysis was performed using the R 3.4.3 statistical software (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing), with a significance level of p <0.05. Results Overall, the printed crowns showed lower occlusal differences than the milled crowns, when compared to the CAD design file, with a statistically significant difference in P1 (difference of 0.025 ± 0.046 mm), P2 (difference of 0.027 ± 0 0.044 mm) and P3 ( difference of 0.018 ± 0.050) for Analysis A (p <0.05). In the Analysis B the direct comparison between the degree of average difference between the pre-adjustment and the post-occlusal adjustment of the milled and printed crowns shows that the printed crowns have lower occlusal mean difference values in all three points compared to the milled ones (difference of 0.146 ± 0.273 mm in P1, 0.285 ± 0.360 mm in P2 and 0.257 ± 0.277 mm in P3). Conclusions Within the limitation of this study, the data obtained showed a better occlusal surface dimensional accuracy of the 3D printed provisional crowns, when compared to the milled ones.

Methods First, an HA-polydopamine-Ag-polydopamine (HA-PDA-Ag-PDA) filler was prepared and characterized using SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD and FTIR. Then, the HA-PDA-Ag-PDA filler was mixed into an adhesive at different mass fractions (0 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%) to prepare a functional adhesive. Antibacterial and mineralization tests were carried out, and the cytotoxicity of the functional adhesive against L929 fibroblasts was also examined. Results The SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD and FTIR characterizations confirmed the successful preparation of the HA-PDA-Ag filler. The 1 wt% and 2 wt% functional adhesives showed the strongest bacterial inhibition effect among all the samples (p < 0.05).

Study selection Randomized controlled studies with minimum 2 years follow-up, comparing different adhesive strategies and/or restorative materials in permanent teeth were included. Our outcome was the occurrence of secondary caries. Bayesian pairwise and network-meta-analysis were conducted. Data We included 50 trials; 19 assessing secondary caries depending on different adhesive strategies, 31 on restorative materials. Studies were published between 2005 and 2017, largely of unclear risk of bias, and included a mean of 40 (range: 8–90) participants and 46 (range: 14–200) placed restorations. Mean follow-up was 43 (range: 24–180) months. Secondary caries was a rare event; the majority of studies did not find any lesions. Network meta-analysis found great uncertainty. 3-step etch-and-rinse adhesives showed the lowest risk of secondary caries, 2-step etch-and-rinse the highest. For restorative materials, resin-modified glass ionomer showed the lowest risk of secondary caries. Most resin composites showed similar risks. Conclusion Data from randomized trials comparing different adhesive strategies or restorative materials are extremely scarce. The differences between materials were limited over the observational period of the included studies. The yielded rankings should be interpreted with caution. Clinical significance Despite often claimed to be a major complication of restorations, there is surprisingly little data on secondary caries from randomized trials.

Two experienced dentists performed the evaluation following the FDI criteria after 5 to 10 years. Kaplan-Meier test was used for longevity analysis of success and survival. Data were tested for normality with Shapiro-Wilk test. Cox regression analysis, with significance level appointed at p ≤ .05, was performed using success and survival of restorations as dependent variables. Annual failure rates (AFRs) were calculated. Results Overall, 72 indirect gold restorations prepared in posterior teeth were assessed, with an observation time from 63 months to 117 months. The mean service time was 88.1 months and the median 87 months. No failures, but 2 repairs, were observed during the first five years. From 5 to 10 years 1 replacement and 1 more repair occurred. The survival and success rates of gold restorations were calculated at 9 years with 98.6% and 91%, respectively. Restorations placed on premolars had higher survival and success rates compared to molars. Three cases were categorized as repairs: in two cases, a root canal treatment was needed and, in one other, an occlusal perforation of the restoration was observed. Conclusions Posterior indirect gold restorations placed by dental undergraduate students showed a highly predictable clinical performance in terms of success and survival. These results are comparable with survival rates reported in literature for restorations cemented in general dental practices.

All schools indicated the use of posterior composites for 2- and 3-surface cavities in premolars and molars. The didactic teaching time devoted to composites was greater than for amalgam (38 h vs 29 h). Clinically, most posterior restorations placed by students were composites (average 74.1 %, range 10 %–100 %); the remaining 25.9 % were amalgams (range, 0 %–50 %). Slot-type cavities were the preparation techniques most commonly taught (n = 11,84.6 %). The use of rubber dam for moisture control was mandatory in most schools (n = 11, 84.6 %).

Bivariate comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test to assess the association of the respondent characteristics (age, gender…) with the decision to repair DRs, and responses to clinical cases. Results The response rate was 82.9%. 50.4% of the respondents declared they at least sometimes consider DRs repair in their clinical practice instead of DRs total replacement. For the 89.8% who at least rarely repaired DRs, the main characteristic determining the therapeutic strategy was the defect size (71%, mainly inclined to repair small defects), followed by the defect type (marginal defect or crack for more than 60% of the respondents) and the material of initial restoration (composite for 63.5%). When shown clinical photographs illustrating DRs, most of respondents proposed a replacement with inlay/onlay or crown. Conclusions This study indicates that a significant proportion of French GDPs do not make sufficient use of DR repair on a routine basis.

Methods Two maxillary master cast samples were prepared. The bases of both the master casts were made from zirconium oxide. The difference between the two casts was that the teeth of the [ZR] cast were produced from zirconium oxide and that of the [LD] cast were made of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic. Unlike the zirconia teeth of the [ZR] cast, the lithium disilicate teeth of the [LD] cast were glazed. The two master casts were digitized using a high-resolution scanner (Atos Compact Scan 5 M, GOM GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) to obtain digital reference casts. Subsequently, each master cast was scanned 15 times using four IOSs. The IOSs were the Cerec Omnicam [OM], Primescan [PR], Trios 4 [TR4], and VivaScan [VS]. On surface comparison, the absolute mean deviation values were obtained for trueness and precision. For multiple comparisons, statistically significant differences were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The p-value was adjusted to control for the increased risk of type I error (p < 0.0083). To compare the two means, the t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used (p < 0.05). Results Trueness values for [ZR] ranged from 24.6 (±6.3) µm for [PR] and 77.1 (±8.3) µm for [OM]. Trueness values for [LD] were between 28.3 (±6.3) µm for [PR] and 72.8 (±15.6) µm for [OM]. Precision values for [ZR] ranged from 17.6 (±3.7) µm for [PR] to 37.3 (±9.9) µm for [OM]. Precision values for [LD] ranged from 17.5 (±3.6) µm for [PR] to 41.8 (±8.7) µm for [OM]. Statistically significant differences were found among all the IOSs (p < 0.0083). The trueness values of the four IOSs did not differ significantly (p < 0.05) with respect to either the [ZR] or [LD] cast. The precision values of [OM] and [VS] differed significantly with respect to the scanned surface. Conclusions Complete arch scans achieved with the four IOSs showed significantly different trueness and precision results. [VS] and [OM] were more sensitive in terms of the scanned material. Clinical significance The latest IOSs showed the required accuracy for complete arch digital impressions in-vitro investigations. These findings should be implemented under conditions relevant to complete arch deviations, such as the construction of occlusal splints, analysis of occlusal relationships, and long-span restorations. Clinicians should be aware that the clinically acceptable threshold varies depending on the purpose of the IOS.","","Intraoral, Scanner, Accuracy, Digital, 3D comparison","",""

Materials and method This study included twelve patients receiving fourteen 3-unit posterior FDPs. 2 FDPs were made for each restoration site: one fabricated in complete-digital workflow comprising intraoral scan with static bite registration (Trios 3) and a monolithic zirconia FDP (test); the other fabricated in complete-analog workflow comprising conventional impression/face-bow transfer and a porcelain-fused-to-metal FDP (control). The FDPs (n=28) were intraorally/provisionally fixed, and quadrant-like intraoral scans were taken for every FDP before & after their occlusal adjustments. Pre- and post-adjustment scans of each FDP were then superimposed using best-fit alignment (GOM Inspect) to measure the volumetric occlusal adjustment amount (mm3) (3Matic) (Mann Whitney U, α=0.05). The patient and operator experience for digital and analog workflows were evaluated using visual analog scales (Wilcoxon test, α=0.05). Results Mean occlusal adjustments were 7.63 mm3 [±7.02] and 25.95 mm3 [±39.61] for test and control groups, respectively. The volumetric adjustment difference was clinically noticeable but not significant (P=0.12). The impression and digital workflow adjustment were perceived more favorably by both operator (P=0.003, P=0.046, respectively) and the patients (P=0.003, P=0.002, respectively). Conclusions Within the limitations of this clinical study, the complete digital workflow with digital static bite-registration provided high occlusal accuracy for short-span tooth-supported FDPs. In addition, the patient and operator preferences significantly favored the digital workflow. Clinical significance Complete-digital workflow employing intraoral scanning and model-free fabrication of monolithic-Zr short-span tooth-supported FDPs offers an effective treatment modality with sufficient occlusal accuracy. Therefore complete-digital workflow is a valid alternative for complete-analog workflow comprising conventional impression, face-bow transfer, and use of a semi-adjustable articulator.","","Clinical research, Tooth-supported, Fixed dental prosthesis (FDP), Effectiveness, Model-free fabrication, Complete digital workflow, Monolithic zirconia","",""

Materials and methods A total of 60 extracted human, single-rooted premolar teeth were endodontically treated and sectioned horizontally 2 mm above the cementoenamel junction. Sectioned teeth were restored using two reconstruction designs: endocrowns (Cendo) or post-crowns (Cpost) (n = 30 p/g). In each group, reconstructions were fabricated from 3 different CAD/CAM substrates (n = 10 p/g); a resin-based composite (Cera), a lithium disilicate glass ceramic (LiSi) and a monolithic, translucent zirconia (Zir). Additional 10 intact teeth were used as control. Restored teeth were subjected to dynamic fatigue test (10−50 N, 600,000 cycles) and thermocycling (5−55 °C, 1500 cycles). Load-to-failure and failure mode was determined following application of a static, 45° oblique compressive load on each specimen. One-way and Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey’s post hoc and chi-square tests were used to determine statistically significant interactions among experimental and control groups. Results All specimens survived the mechanical and thermal fatigue tests. A statistically significant interaction between reconstruction design and material type was observed (p  <  0.001). CpostZir and CendoCera groups exhibited significantly higher post-fatigue load-to-failure when compared to other materials of the same reconstruction design (p ≤ 0.001). The highest frequency of catastrophic failures was observed with Zir reconstructions in both designs. Intact teeth exhibited significantly higher load-to-failure when compared to all groups (p ≤ 0.042) except CpostZir (p = 0.345).

Methods A conventional resin-based composite (RBC - Majesty ES-2; Kuraray, Japan) and a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC – Ionolux; VOCO, Germany) were used to restore standardized class II cavities (n = 4/tooth, cervical margin in dentin) in 16 human molars. The ability to produce secondary caries with Streptococcus mutans biofilms was tested using either an open-cycle or closed-cycle bioreactor (n = 8 specimens/model). Specimens were scanned before and after the biofilm exposure using micro-CT (Skyscan 1176, 9 µm resolution, 80 kV, 300 mA). Image reconstruction was performed, and demineralization depths (µm) were evaluated at the restoration margins and a distance of 1.0 mm. Results Dentin demineralization could be observed in all specimens, and enamel demineralization in 50% of the specimens. The open system bioreactor produced lesions with significantly higher overall demineralization depths (p < .001). However, demineralization depths at a 1.0 mm distance from the restoration margins showed no difference between open and closed systems or materials. In the open system, significantly lower demineralization depths were observed in proximity to RMGIC than RBC (p < .001), which was not significantly different in the closed system (p = .382). Conclusions Both systems produced in vitro secondary caries in an accelerated way. However, the open-cycle bioreactor system confirmed the caries-protective activity exerted by the RMGIC material in contrast to the RBC, better simulating materials’ clinical behavior.

Also, the study aimed to analyze the effects of tooth vitality (vital versus non-vital), abutment location (anterior versus posterior), and luting cement (self-adhesive resin versus resin-reinforced glass ionomer) on clinical outcomes. Methods A total of 147 prostheses (in 94 patients) placed by undergraduate dental students in a university dental center during the period 2015–2021 were examined clinically using modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) and California Dental Association (CDA) criteria. The mean duration of follow-up was 37 months (range, 6 - 63 months) for the single crowns (n = 77) and 25 months (range, 6 - 68 months) for the 3-unit FDPs (n = 70). Data were descriptively analyzed to determine the types and rates of complications based on USPHS and CDA criteria. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimation method was used to determine the cumulative survival and success rates of the prostheses (α=0.05). Differences in clinical outcomes (survival or failure) according to tooth vitality, luting cement, and location were statistically analyzed using cross-tabulations and Х2 test (α=0.05). Results The Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival rate was estimated as 96% for the Zi 3-unit FDPs after 5.5 years, and 90% for the Zi single crowns after 4.8 years. The 5-year estimated success rate was 68% for both 3-unit FDPs and single crowns. Seven (9.1%) 77Zi single crowns and 70 2 (2.9%) Zi 3-unit FDPs were recorded as failures with occlusal roughness being the most commonly-observed complication (crowns: 4 [5.6%]; 3-unit FDPs: 8 [11.4%]). In terms of clinical outcomes, statistically significant differences were found between all included vital and non-vital teeth (p = .006), and cement types (p = .028). Taking single crowns alone, significant differences in clinical outcomes according to tooth vitality were noted (p = .036), but not for PFDPs. The location of the prostheses did not produce any significant differences in the clinical outcomes, for both prostheses types independently or combined (p > .05). Conclusions The estimated cumulative survival rates in this study for single crowns and 3-unit Zi FDPs concurred with the ranges reported in systematic reviews. Zi-based prostheses on vital teeth produced better clinical outcomes than those placed on non-vital teeth, and type of luting cement influenced the final clinical outcome. Clinical significance Zi crowns and 3-unit PFDPs fabricated using the specific CAD-CAM system used in the controlled environment of this study showed good clinical performance with minimal veneer porcelain chipping. Root canal treated teeth seem to be at higher risk for failure of Zi prostheses compared with vital teeth.","","Zirconia, Ceramic, crown, Partial fixed dental prosthesis, Survival, Failure, Complications","",""

Second, this study aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy for the developed CNN (test method) compared to that of an expert evaluation (reference standard). Methods The whole image set of 1761 images (483 of unrestored teeth, 570 of composite restorations, 213 of cements, 278 of amalgam restorations, 125 of gold restorations and 92 of ceramic restorations) was divided into a training set (N = 1407, 401, 447, 66, 231, 93, and 169, respectively) and a test set (N = 354, 82, 123, 26, 47, 32, and 44).

The purpose of thisin vitro study was to evaluate the surface properties and Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation on direct and indirect CRMs after using different polishing techniques. Methods Two CRMs (direct and indirect) and four polishing techniques (aluminium oxide discs, diamond polishing paste, aluminium oxide polishing paste, and silicon carbide brush) were evaluated. The specimens were prepared for taking scanning electron microscopy images (n = 2) and determining surface roughness, surface free energy, and bacterial biofilm formation (BBF) with colony-forming unit counting and confocal laser scanning microscopy assays (n = 7). The data were analysed using two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni as a post hoc test and Pearson’s correlation (p < .05).

Restorations were designed with a 20-µm-wide marginal and a 60-µm-wide internal cement gap, and were made from 3D-printed zirconia (LithaCon 3Y 210, Lithoz, n = 24) and milled zirconia (Cercon ht, DentsplySirona, n = 12). For milled zirconia, a drill compensation was needed to give the milling bur access to the intaglio surface. The restorations were cemented, cross-sectioned, and the cement gap size was analyzed by two raters. Inter-rater reliability was studied at 12 3D-printed veneers (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC, mixed model, absolute agreement). Twelve remaining 3D-printed restorations were compared with 12 milled restorations regarding fit at three locations: marginally, labially, and at the incisal edge (Mann–Whitney U-tests, α<0.05). Results Inter-rater reliability was excellent, with an ICC single-measure coefficient of 0.944 (95%-confidence interval: [0.907; 0.966]). Gap sizes (mean ± SD / maximum) were 55 ± 9 / 143 µm at the margins, 68 ± 14 / 130 µm labially, and 78 ± 19 / 176 µm at the incisor edge for 3D-printed veneers. For milled veneers, gap sizes were 44 ± 11 / 141 µm at the margins, 85 ± 19 / 171 µm labially, and 391 ± 26 / 477 µm at the incisor edge. At the margins, the milled veneers outperformed the 3D-printed restorations (p = 0.011). The cement gap at the incisor edge was significantly smaller after 3D printing (p < 0.001). Conclusions 3D-printed zirconia restorations showed clinically acceptable mean marginal gaps below 100 µm. Because drill compensation could be omitted with 3D printing, the fit at the sharp incisal edge was significantly tighter than with milling. Clinical significance The fit of 3D-printed ceramic anterior restorations meets clinical standards. In addition, 3D printing is associated with a greater geometrical freedom than milling.

Methods Cases of full-coverage zirconia-based restorations cemented with either RMGIC or SAC between March 2016 and February 2019 were evaluated in this study. The clinical outcomes of the restorations were analyzed according to the type of cement used. In addition, cumulative success and survival rates were evaluated according to the cement and abutment types. Non-inferiority, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox hazard tests were conducted (α=.05). Results A total of 288 full-coverage zirconia-based restorations (natural teeth, 157; implant restorations, 131) were analyzed. Loss of retention occurred in only one case; a single-unit implant crown cemented with RMGIC, which decemented 4.25 years post-restoration. RMGIC was non-inferior to SAC in terms of loss of retention (<5%). For single-unit natural tooth restorations, the four-year success rates in the RMGIC and SAC groups were 100% and 95.65%, respectively (p=.122).

Methods. Six CAD/CAM ceramics: lithium disilicate (LS2), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS), lithium aluminosilicate (LAS), polymer infiltrated (PIC), feldspar (FEL) and zirconium oxide (ZRO) and five common luting agents, two self-adhesive and three adhesive materials, were included. SD-OCT wavelengths (1310/1550 nm) and frequencies (5/28 kHz) that are particularly suitable for these materials were investigated. Subsequently, a clinical simulation was performed with an adhesively or self-adhesively inserted partial crown made of a ceramic that had an OCT penetration depth of > 1.0 mm. Results Best SD-OCT penetration was obtained at 1550 nm and 28 kHz. For ZLS, LS2 and LAS, SD-OCT light penetration depth of > 4 mm was shown. In contrast, the penetration depth of ZRO, PIC and FEL was less than 1 mm. Adhesive and self-adhesive luting agents could be visualized up to ≥ 0.9 mm. All clinically relevant areas (ceramic restoration, luting area, interfaces and adjacent tooth structures) can be imaged when SD-OCT-suitable ceramics are used. Conclusions SD-OCT can be used to analyze CAD/CAM ceramics based on ZLS, LS2 and LAS, whereas ZRO, PIC, and FEL had insufficient penetration depth for clinical application. The type of luting agent or its thickness played an insignificant role. With suitable ceramics, SD-OCT can be recommended as a non-invasive examination tool. Clinical Significance This study indicates that SD-OCT is a useful non-invasive examination method for monitoring lithium silicate-based ceramic restorations and adjacent structures.","","CAD/CAM, Ceramics, Luting agents, OCT","",""

Methods We captured 20-, 18-, 16-, 14-, 12-, and 10-mm length post space scans using an IOS (Primescan) eight times each by shortening the apical 2 mm end of the same mandibular canine tooth. The reference impressions of each length group were taken using a light-body polyvinyl siloxane impression material and were scanned with an extraoral scanner. The recorded standard tessellation language (STL) data of all impressions were uploaded to a 3D matching program for the trueness evaluation via the root mean square (RMS) calculation. For the statistical analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Mann-Whitney U nonparametric tests were performed to compare the differences among the groups (α=0.05). Results The median RMS values increased in direct proportion to the length of the post space from 10 mm (357.1 µm) to 20 mm (897.5 µm). We noted a significant difference among groups (p< 0.001). In the pairwise comparisons, there were no significant differences between the 14 mm and 16 mm groups (p=0.431) or between the 18 mm and 20 mm groups (p=0.036), while other paired groups showed significant differences (p=0.001). Conclusions The scanned space depth affected the trueness of the IOS (Primescan). If the post depth was below 14 mm, and the minimum diameter was 2.2 mm, Primescan could be used for impressions of the post-core structure, simplifying the impression procedure. Clinical significance IOS seems to be a promising technology for taking digital impressions of post spaces, but cannot be recommended as a routine procedure at its present stage, as final results are highly dependent on the clinical situation. Further studies with different IOS systems are needed to gain sound evidence.","","Digital impression, Intraoral scanner, Post space impression, Trueness","",""

It is generally associated with disappearance of the enamel-cementum junction, a key landmark, and a surface discrepancy requiring restoration or compensation using a connective tissue graft (CTG). The aim of this systematic review is to study the efficacy of periodontal plastic surgery on recession defects associated with a NCCL, with or without restorative treatment. Materials and methods RCT assessing the root coverage of teeth with Miller's class I and class II isolated gingival recession with an NCCL published up to April 2020, with at least 10 patients per group and a follow-up longer than 6 months, were included through electronic databases and hand-searched journals. Results Seven articles were finally included. Treatment systematically consisted of a coronally advanced flap in association with partial or complete restorative treatment ± CTG. Meta-analyses showed that periodontal plastic procedures are less effective in terms of complete root coverage in cases of teeth with an NCCL. Overall Mean Recession Reduction was 2.00 mm (CI: [1.72, 2.28]), and overall mean complete root coverage was 5% (CI: [2,8]). Conclusion The presence of an NCCL is a complicating factor in plastic surgery. The use of CTG without NCCL restoration provides better outcomes except for the reduction of dental hypersensitivity for which the combined treatment (restoration + CTG) is the most effective.","","Non-carious cervical lesions, Isolated gingival recession, Muco-gingival surgery, Systematic review, Meta-analysis","",""

Methods A total of 83 IPS-Empress-inlays/onlays were placed in 30 patients. Restorations were luted according to two different strategies: 43 restorations were fixed with a self-adhesive resin-cement (RelyXUnicem, RX), 40 restorations were inserted with VariolinkII-low (SV) after pretreatment with an etch-and-rinse multi-step adhesive. Recalls were performed after two weeks (n=83), two years (n= 82), four years (n=74) and 14 years (n=54). Two independent calibrated examiners evaluated all restorations using modified USPHS-criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise Mann-Whitney-U-test and Friedman-test (p < 0.05). Results After 14 years, 54 restorations in 22 patients were evaluated (eight patients equalling 29 inlays not available). Ten restorations had to be replaced (failure rate 12%); four (SV-group) showed bulk fractures and two (RX-group) exhibited marginal fractures at the 14-year recall. Overall, the SV-group revealed significantly better results regarding discoloration of the luting gap (p<0.05) compared to the RX-group. No statistically significant differences were computed between SV and RX for the remaining criteria at the respective recalls (p>0.05). However, statistically significant deteriorations were detected for both luting procedures over 14 years regarding “colour match”, “marginal integrity” and “tooth integrity” (p<0.05). Conclusions The self-adhesive resin-cement RelyXUnicem showed similar clinical performance to a conventional multi-step luting-procedure after 14 years for most of the test parameters with a slightly inferior performance of RelyXUnicem regarding discoloration of the luting gap. Clinical significance The current study presents unique in-vivo long-term data on two adhesion-strategies for indirect ceramic single-tooth restorations. Differences in performance of the two luting methods after being challenged for 14 years in the oral environment are highlighted.

Methods Thirteen groups of materials were investigated. Cylindrical-shaped specimens were fabricated. Deionised water or lactic-acid solution were used as the storage media. Solutions were changed after 1d, 4d, 7d, and 14d of ion release and at the same periods after recharge with MI Varnish (7 -h storage). F, Ca, and P measurements were accomplished using a fluoride-ion selective electrode, atomic absorption spectrometry, and colourimetric method by spectrophotometer, respectively. Relative Vickers hardness was proceeded with similar specimens used in the F assay (4 periods). SEM/EDS was additionally performed. Statistical analyses were calculated in each parameter (p < 0.05). Result Hardness of several ILMs immediately increased after recharge. After 28d, Ketac Universal [a high-viscosity glass-ionomer cement (HVGIC)] showed the highest hardness similar to the resin composite control. Although 2 HVGICs (Zirconomer and Equia Forte Fil) ranked as first and second for F release/re-release, some HVGICs had inferior or comparable F capacity to RMGICs (Fuji VIII and Fuji II LC) and a resin-based (RB) ILM (Cention N). Cention N, Activa-Restorative (RB-ILM), and Zirconomer were the top-3 ranking for Ca release/re-release. Activa-Restorative showed the highest P release, whereas Cention N displayed the greatest recharge ability for P. Conclusions Zirconomer showed a versatile performance for ion-release/re-release, especially for F. Cention N had excellent capacity in relation to Ca release and recharge ability of Ca/P.

Purpose To restore esthetics and masticatory function of the patient with dentinogenesis imperfecta. Methods A 24-year-old male patient had multiple caries but no occlusion on the right side. The examination revealed DMF-T 31, tulip-shaped and short/rounded radixes, shell-like chipping of enamel, which led to the diagnosis of type-II dentinogenesis imperfecta. After elimination of all decays an intraoral scanner (Trios 3, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to capture the initial surface information on both arches. The 3D-mirroring technique was performed: the tooth shapes were copied from the less-damaged surfaces on the left side to the right side, and smile design (3Shape Smile Design) was performed to reconstruct the esthetics of the fronts. Reconstructed 3D tooth surfaces were generated. All teeth were prepared and digitalized. Sectioned bite registration and digital bite acquisitions were performed. Reconstructed 3D tooth surfaces were copied onto the prepared teeth data and temporaries were 3D printed (NextDent 5100, NextDent B.V., Soesterberg, Netherlands) out from resin (NextDent C&B MFH) and cemented. After 3 months of wearing, the temporaries were rescanned intraorally, master casts were printed. Metal frameworks were sintered based on the prepared teeth scans, then porcelain layering is done on printed master casts in an adjustable articulator (PROTAREvo3, KaVo, Biberach, Germany).

Methods Pyromellitic glycerol dimethacrylate (PMGDM) and ethoxylated bisphenol-A-dimethacrylate (EBPADMA) were used to make PEHB monomer. Five cements were fabricated: (1) PEHB+0%NACP+0%DMAHDM (experimental control); (2) PEHB+25%NACP+0%DMAHDM, (3) PEHB+25%NACP+0%DMAHDM; (4) PEHB+25%NACP+3%DMAHDM; (5) PEHB+25%NACP+5%DMAHDM.

Long-term Calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) ion release, recharge, and re-release were assessed. Results Compared to experimental and commercial controls, the NACP-DMAHDM cement significantly reduced CFU biofilm by 2–3 orders of magnitude, metabolic activities from 0.24±0.06 A540/cm2 to 0.03±0.01 A540/cm2, and lactic acid production from 27.7 ± 2.5 mmol/L to 5.4 ± 2.1 mmol/L (n = 6) (p<0.05). The DMAHDM showed an MIC value of 0.03 mg/L. However, when the DMAHDM was combined with PMGDM monomer, the MIC was greater than DMAHDM alone. The ion concentrations for the experimental groups significantly increased over time (1–84 days), indicating continuous ion release (n = 3) (p<0.05). Increasing the DMAHDM mass fraction from 0% to 5% and 3% to 5% significantly enhanced ion recharge and re-release at the third cycle (p<0.05).

This STL served as the control (C-STL) and was used to fabricate 30 crown patterns in 3D-printed resin (PR, ProArt Print Wax), millable wax suitable for casting (BW, ProArt CAD Wax Blue), and millable wax suitable for pressing (YW, ProArt CAD Wax Yellow) (n = 10). Subtractively manufactured patterns were fabricated by using a 5-axis milling unit (PrograMill PM7), while 3D-printed patterns were fabricated by using a digital light processing-based 3D printer (PrograPrint PR5; Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). All fabricated patterns were digitized by using an intraoral scanner (CEREC Primescan SW 5.2) to generate test-STLs. C-STL and test-STLs were transferred into a 3D analysis software (Medit Link v 2.4.4). Trueness evaluation was performed at 4 different surfaces (external, intaglio with margin, marginal, and intaglio without margin) and for complete scan meshes (overall) by using the root mean square (RMS) method. Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (α = .05). Results RMS values varied significantly at all surfaces (P < .001), except for marginal surface (P = .151).

No significant differences were observed between YW and BW (P ≥ .223). Conclusion Patterns fabricated by using subtractive manufacturing exhibited high trueness. The deviation values, in general, were small, particularly at intaglio and marginal surfaces; thus, clinical difference in crown-fit may be negligible using additive or subtractive technique.

Materials and methods A total of 126 extracted teeth with deep dental caries were assessed using International Caries Risk and Assessment (ICDAS). Eight teeth were subsequently selected after radiographic evaluation. Each lesion was removed, leaving a thin layer of leathery dentine at the deepest part of cavity. Different cavity lining materials were placed; Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), calcium hydroxide, (Ca(OH)2), resin-based material (RBM). For each, the restorative material was an encapsulated glass ionomer (GIC) and the control group had a GIC restoration alone. Each tooth was immediately placed in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF). All samples were then imaged using XMT at baseline, and three weeks after treament. The XMT images were then subtracted to show the mineral concentration changes three weeks after treatment. Results There were significant increases in mineral concentrations within the residual demineralised dentine in individual teeth treated with Ca(OH)2, MTA, RBM, and GIC following immersion in SBF for three weeks. GIC group without any liners showed the greatest increase in mineral concentration, followed by MTA and Ca(OH)2.

Reduced graphene-silver nanoparticle (R-GNs/Ag) nanocomposite exhibits excellent antibacterial activities. This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial and mechanical properties of GIC modified by incorporation of different proportion of R-GNs/Ag. Methods R-GNs/Ag nanoparticles were incorporated into conventional glass ionomer powder at 0–2.00 wt.% concentration and cement specimen were prepared. The antibacterial properties of R-GNs/Ag modified GIC materials were investigated by direct contact test (DCT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, XTT assay and bacteria live/dead assay. Flexural strength and surface microhardness were measured by a universal testing machine and a microhardness tester, respectively. Results The DCT demonstrated an obvious decrease of S. mutans quantity with incorporation of 2.00 wt.% nanoparticles (p < 0.05). SEM images showed fewer bacteria and smaller stacks on the surface of modified specimens. No significant difference was found in the metabolic activity of S. mutans according to the XTT assay (p < 0.05). The addition of 1.00 and 2.00 wt.% R-GNs/Ag significantly decreased the percentage of viable bacteria (p < 0.05). There was no significant decrease of flexural strength and surface microhardness with incorporation of up to 2.00 wt.% nanocomposite (p < 0.05). Conclusions R-GNs/Ag nanocomposite might be a promising agent to improve the antibacterial activity of dental restorative GIC without compromising its mechanical properties.

Clinical evaluation was applied using the USPHS criteria, and the presence of Charlie or Delta scores at the marginal integrity were considered as a failure. Results The overall survival rate of restorations was 68% after 36 months, 81% for TCR and 57% for SCR (p = 0.004). The multivariable Cox Regression model demonstrated that restorations performed after SCR had 3.44 times greater probability of failure compared to TCR (p = 0.006). The other two predictors for failure of restorations were teeth with Class II cavities (hazard ratio = 3.3) and children with gingival bleeding over 20% (hazard ratio = 2.5). Conclusions Performing composite restorations after SCR in primary teeth had success rate significantly lower than restorations performed after TCR. Complex cavities and worst patient´s oral hygiene were found to be predictors of failure of restorations.

Confusion exists in the literature in terms of the indication and rationale for each VPT approach. The objectives of the present study are to elucidate the indications for VPT and to present a set of histopathology and histobacteriology-based guidelines for VPT in teeth with deep caries. Methods Two hundred and sixty-four carious, unrestored and VPT-treated human teeth, which were extracted for reasons not related to the present study. The teeth were processed for histological and histobacteriological examination. Other 757 clinical cases that received different VPT procedures were followed-up to identify success rates, with the longest observational period of 30 years. Results Follow-up of the clinical cases indicated that direct pulp capping was successful in 73.2%, partial pulpotomy in 96.4% and full pulpotomy in 77.8% of the cases. Histological and histobacteriological examination showed a localised inflammatory response that commonly occurred in the subjacent pulp tissue as soon as the enamel was penetrated by caries. If the softened and infected dentine were completely excavated, without pulp exposure, and the cavity restored with an adequate restoration, pulp inflammation frequently subsided. In teeth showing pulp exposure, the extent of bacterial penetration varied and areas of infection presented severe pulp inflammation, including micro-abscesses. However, the pulp tissue apical to the infected/inflamed area was usually uninflamed and normal. Guidelines based on the present histopathological, histobacteriological and clinical findings are proposed for VPT and mainly involve direct examination of dentine and the exposed pulp tissue under deep caries for decision-making, and require strict asepsis during procedures. Conclusions Vital pulp therapy following the guidelines proposed in the present article has the potential to improve the outcome of the conservative treatment of mature teeth with deep caries and in some occasions may be an alternative to pulpectomy. Clinical Significance A guideline for VPT in the treatment of deep caries is proposed, focusing on direct observation of dentine and the exposed pulp tissue under deep caries. Stringent aseptic techniques are mandatory for VPT procedures to be successful.","","caries, direct pulp capping, pulpotomy, vital pulp therapy","",""

Methods 192 sound human molars were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n = 64): sound enamel, demineralised enamel, sound dentine. Sixty-four teeth with natural carious lesions including caries-affected dentine (CAD) were selected. All substrates were prepared, conditioned and restored with pRMGIC (30% ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate (EGMP, experimental), Fuji II LC (control), Fuji IX, and Filtek™ Supreme with Scotchbond ™ Universal Adhesive. Shear bond strength (SBS) was determined after 24 h and three months storage in SBF at 37 °C. The debonded surfaces were examined using stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), Bonferroni post hoc tests (alpha=0.05) and independent T-tests were used for multifactorial data analysis. Results The hydrophilicity and functionality of EGMP enhanced the bond strength of the pRMGIC to different substrates after 24 h and 3 months as compared to F2LC (p<0.05). Adhesive failures were found to decrease with pRMGIC and integration into exposed enamel prisms and dentine tubules was observed with SEM. Ageing enhanced bond strength of pRMGIC to all substrates but was statistically significantly only in sound dentine. The SBS of pRMGIC was higher with sound vs. demineralised enamel at both time periods (p<0.001), while it was higher to CAD initially and to sound dentine post-storage (p = 0.004). Conclusions pRMGIC exhibited enhanced bonding performance to various tooth tissues with an ability to seal exposed enamel prisms and dentine tubules.

Methods Cervical, medial and apical root dentin surfaces were treated with two experimental hydroxyapatite-based cements, containing sodium hydroxide (calcypatite) or zinc oxide (oxipatite); an epoxy resin- based canal sealer, AH Plus; and gutta-percha. Root dentin was evaluated for fluid filtration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive analysis, AFM, Young’s modulus and Nano-DMA analysis were also performed, at the inner and outer zones of dentin. Results Dentin treated with oxipatite showed the lowest microleakage among groups with hermetically sealed tubules and zinc-based salt formations. Samples treated with oxipatite showed the highest Ei at the cervical dentin third among groups, at 6 m of storage. Oxipatite promoted the highest complex modulus and tan delta values at the inner zone of both cervical and medial root dentin. Calcypatite favored the lowest tan delta outcomes at the inner zone of apical dentin at 6 m. Conclusions Specimens treated with oxipatite showed the highest sealing ability, based on the highest Young’s modulus and dentin mineralization, achieved by closing dentinal tubules, voids and pores that reinforced the inner zone of root dentin. The homogeneity of viscoelastic properties among the different root dentin thirds favored the energy dissipation without creating zones of stress concentration and micro-cracking which would have challenge micropermeability. Thereby, among the tested materials oxipatite is proposed as canal filling material and sealer in endodontics. Clinical significance Oxipatite could be considered a good candidate for root canal filling material and sealer due to its improved long-term sealing ability and to the advanced remineralization, and so to the enhanced energy dissipation achieved at the inner zone of the radicular dentin.","","Hydroxyapatite, Mechanics, Remineralisation, Root dentine, Zinc","",""

There was no significant change in the fracture load of any CAD/CAM crowns after TCML (p>0.05). CS exhibited a significantly higher volume wear than the other materials investigated. The wear tracts of all TCML crowns acted as failure origins during the fracture test. Conclusions The fracture resistance of glass-ceramic CAD/CAM crowns was significantly higher than that of resin composite crowns. A 5-year TCML aging did not affect the fracture resistance of CAD/CAM crowns investigated. However, TCML treatment produces a larger wear track in CS than in other materials.

Methods Reciprocating wear tests were performed on bonded interface samples involving commercial resin composite (Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill), resin cement (Rely X U200) and tooth enamel using the ball-on-flat configuration. The bonded samples were subjected up to 5 × 104 cycles of sliding contact, and the wear depth and wear track morphology were characterized after increments using white light interferometry and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Optical microscopy was also used to evaluate cracks and their propagation in the samples. Results In the early stages of sliding contact, wear evolved most rapidly at the interface, followed by the enamel and the resin composite. Gradually, the difference between the wear depth at the interface and other areas decreased. Furthermore, cracks and brittle fracture appeared in the enamel during the early stages of wear, adjacent to the interface. With continuing cyclic loading, enamel wear manifested primarily as ploughs, with discontinuous pits and peeled material. Cracking decreased to only a few cracks extending to the inner enamel and parallel to the interface. Conclusions Cracking and damage occurred in the enamel during the early stages of sliding contact and accelerated by poor margin finishing. Cracks caused by wear under sliding contact could be one of the reasons for secondary caries and tooth discoloration.","","Bonded interface, Damage mode, Enamel, Resin composite, Wear","",""

From the initial study cohort, eleven implant crown/enamel antagonist pairs with adjacent enamel antagonist pairs could be analyzed in nine patients after 12 months. After 24 months, ten implant crowns of eight patients were available due to one decementation of an implant crown. A semiautomatic specifically developed iterative closest point algorithm was used to superimpose the surfaces of the baseline scan with the follow-up scans to measure the maximum height loss of each identified wear side. The mean maximum tooth wear and the standard deviation (SD) were calculated per unit. The ratio of wear of enamel/enamel antagonist teeth and the wear ratio of adjacent lithium disilicate implant crowns and their enamel antagonist surfaces were evaluated. Tooth movements were described by translations and rotations using a separate measurement procedure. The surfaces of the scans were superimposed setting the implant as a reference structure for registration. Results After 12 months the wear ratio between the enamel antagonist pairs was 0.95 ± 0.27 µm and the ratio between lithium disilicate/enamel was 0.73 ± 0.49 µm. After 24 months the ratio of enamel antagonist pairs was 1.04 ± 0.28 µm and the ratio of lithium disilicate/enamel was 0.73 ± 0.51 µm. The ratios did not differ significantly. Conclusions Intraoral scanning and computer analysis showed that the two-years wear ratios between enamel/enamel and enamel/lithium disilicate implant crowns did not differ significantly. Statement of clinical relevance The methodology described in this study could measure tooth wear and detect long-term wear performance. In the future, digital monitoring of prosthetic restorations should be integrated into clinical workflow to identify potential factors affecting longevity.","","Tooth wear, Tooth movement, Digital dentistry, Lithium disilicate, Intraoral scanner, Prosthodontics","",""

Methods In a split-mouth design, each three CAD/CAM-PCCs (Vita Mark II, Cerec) were placed in 50 patients. Two PCCs were luted with a conventional resin cement (RelyX Ultimate) combined with a universal adhesive (Scotchbond Universal) without (SB-E) or with (SB+E) selective enamel etching. The third PCC was luted with a self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX Unicem 2; RXU). Chi-square tests (α≤0.05) were applied. Based on clinical failures (complete debonding or need for replacement of the restorations), Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Results 31 patients were evaluated clinically using FDI criteria at 39 months. Clinically acceptable results were detected over time, except for “fracture of material and retention” (inacceptable fractures and debondings). Within materials, statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.003) between baseline and 39 months were found for “marginal adaptation” and “marginal staining”. At 39-month, SB+E and SB-E showed significantly better results compared to RXU in “marginal adaptation”(p ≤ 0.021) and “marginal staining”(p ≤ 0.013). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed higher survival rates after 39 months for SB+E (96%) and SB-E (88%) compared to RXU (69%) with statistically significant differences between RXU vs. SB-E (p = 0.022) and RXU vs. SB+E (p ≤ 0.001). Conclusions After 39-months, PCCs luted with the self-adhesive resin cement exhibited a statistically significant inferior survival rate compared to restorations luted with the conventional resin cement combined with a universal adhesive without or with selective enamel etching. Clinical significance Currently, self-adhesive resin cements cannot be recommended for luting partial ceramic crowns. However, the standard adhesive luting procedure comprising a universal adhesive and luting composite yielded good clinical results for more than 3 years irrespectively of application of a selective enamel etching step.","","Partial ceramic crowns, Self-adhesive resin cements, Universal adhesive, CAD/CAM, Clinical study, Selective enamel etching","",""

Methods A total of 85 two- or three-surface class II restorations, comprising 43 Equia Fil / Equia Coat and 42 Fuji IX GP Fast / Fuji Coat LC, were placed in 34 patients. The restorations were re-evaluated after 6 years using the FDI criteria. The statistical analysis was performed with Fisher’s exact test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Forty-four restorations (22 Equia Fil and 22 Fuji IX GP Fast) could be assessed at the 6-year follow-up. During the whole study period, eight failures, four for each material, were observed. The main reasons for failure were material fractures and retention loss, which were partly combined with poor marginal adaptation or poor proximal anatomical form. Two failures may be attributed to insufficient application of the materials, as suspected according to the radiographs. The Kaplan-Meier survival proportion for Equia Fil restorations at 6 years was 86.5% and that for Fuji IX GP Fast at 6 years was 86.8% (log-rank p = 0.907). During the period from 3 to 6 years, only one filling in each group failed. Conclusion Both materials showed acceptable and comparable survival rates after 6 years. Clinical significance Highly viscous glass ionomer cement can be an acceptable restoration material for smaller class II cavities.","","glass ionomer cement, clinical study, longevity, class II restorations, FDI criteria","",""

Data The literature search was conducted based on the question: “Is the use of compomers as a dental filling material more successful in the restorative treatment of decayed primary teeth than other dental filling materials?” No language restriction was applied and systematic reviews published up to May 2023 were included. The ROBIS tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews. Data were extracted for narrative synthesis, considering the restoration failure/success outcomes. Search Online search was conducted in three databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane library). Study selection The electronic search yielded a total of 779 publications. Finally, 18 systematic reviews were included in this umbrella review. Four systematic reviews presented a low risk of bias, 11 presented an unclear risk of bias and three presented a high risk of bias. Most systematic reviews presenting low risk of bias reported no difference in the success rates of compomers compared to other dental filling materials used for restoration of decayed primary teeth. Studies that found a significant difference or that made clear recommendations towards the use of compomers were commonly rated with a high risk of bias. Conclusion Compomers are similar to other dental filling materials for the placement of direct restorations in primary teeth. Clinical significance The results of this umbrella review indicate a similar clinical performance of compomers compared to other materials containing a resin component for direct restoration in primary teeth. Therefore, the choice of restorative material will depend on multiple factors, such as clinician's skills/preferences, patients’ wishes, costs, and cavity type/location.","","Compomer, Primary teeth, Overview, Systematic review, Umbrella review","",""

In addition, we tried to determine the factors that affect the prognosis of pulpotomy in primary molars. Methods This randomized clinical trial enrolled 158 molars of 52 children; 153 teeth were finally included and divided into three groups: ProRoot MTA (n = 50), Endocem MTA Premixed (n = 53), and Well-Root PT (n = 50). Clinical and radiographic follow-up was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and at the last visit post-treatment. Data were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test, Cox regression analysis, and the Kaplan–Meier survival curve method. Results The success rates in the ProRoot MTA, Endocem MTA Premixed, and Well-Root PT were 92, 84.9 and 82%, respectively. The cumulative survival rates did not differ significantly among the materials. Among the investigated variables, only ΔF and ΔF max significantly affected the success rates. In the multivariate survival tree model, significant unfavorable survival was observed when the ΔF value was -14.4 or less (hazard ratio, 7.56; P = 0.0295). Conclusions Considering the clinical effectiveness of Endocem MTA Premixed and Well-Root PT and the operational convenience as a premixed type, they can be used as advantageous materials in the pulpotomy of primary molars in pediatric patients. The QLF method is a useful diagnostic method that can establish treatment plans and determine the prognosis of pulpotomy based on the ΔF value in primary molars. Clinical significance Endocem MTA Premixed and Well-Root PT can confer high success rates and are non-inferior to ProRoot MTA in pulpotomy for primary molars. We also showed that QLF technology can be applied to predict the success/failure and prognosis of pulpotomies in primary molars.","","Calcium silicate-based cements, Mineral trioxide aggregate, Pulpotomy, Primary molar, Quantitative light-induced fluorescence","",""

Methods All live-born children in Pelotas, in 2004, were prospectively investigated and a representative sample was assessed for oral conditions at ages 5 and 12. The outcome was the quality of the restoration (satisfactory/unsatisfactory). Independent variables included socioeconomic, behavioral and oral health characteristics at the individual level and the size of cavity and material at the tooth level. Associations were tested using multilevel logistic regression models. Results A total of 1,000 participants and 249 restorations in the permanent dentition were examined. Most of the restorations were composites (73.5%), while only 6.8% were amalgam. After adjusted analyses, children whose parents received information on how to prevent their child from developing caries before reaching 5 years of age had 91.0% less chance of having an unsatisfactory restoration compared to children whose parents never received information (OR = 0.09; 95% CI 0.01–0.59). Also, the chances of presenting unsatisfactory restorations were 5.3 higher in children at high-risk for untreated dental caries in the permanent dentition, in comparison with children at low risk (OR = 5.32; 95% CI 1.07–26.6). Conclusions Low-risk for untreated dental caries and having received information on preventing dental caries, reduced the chance of presenting failed restorations, showing that factors related to individuals play an important role in the quality of restorations. Clinical significance Our findings highlight the role that individual-related factors play in restoration longevity in children, reinforcing the need for a patient-centered approach in restorative dentistry.","","Dental restorations, Dental restoration failure, Cohort studies, Child, Posterior teeth, Longevity","",""

Both materials were applied with or without their respective resinous coating, and were compared with a conventional GIC (Ketac Fil) and a hybrid composite resin (CR; G-ænial Posterior). Methods 78 standardized occlusal Class I cavities were restored with the various materials (n = 13 per group). Before and after chewing simulation (30,000 cycles at 40 N), each sample underwent optical scanning procedures (Omnicam). A comparison of the total wear using a fluorescence-aided identification technique (OraCheck) followed, and differences (α = 5%) between groups were compared by means of MANOVA. Results Regarding the wear rates of hvGIC and ghRS, no differences could be observed (p > .050), and this was not affected by the resinous coating. All hvGIC and ghRS restorations showed significantly higher abrasive wear than CR (p < .001), while the conventional GIC displayed a significant underperformance compared with any other material (p < .001). Conclusions Resinous coating of hvGIC or ghRS does not appear to exert an effective long-term protection against advanced abrasive wear. Compared to the conventional GIC showing a considerable substance loss, both hvGIC and ghRS materials revealed an improved abrasion resistance, but clearly failed to meet the excellent values of the CR. Clinical Significance Occlusal loading should be carefully considered when using hvGIC or ghRS as amalgam (or composite resin) alternatives for the restoration of posterior teeth.","","Abrasion, Chewing simulation, Equia, Glass hybrid restorative system, Glass ionomer cement, High-viscosity glass ionomer cement, OraCheck, Resinous coating, Wear","",""
