Methods Two ion-releasing RBCs, Activa (ACT) and Cention-N (CN), were compared to a conventional RBC (Z350) and a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji-II-LC). Ten disk-shaped specimens were fabricated for each material (n = 40). After standardized surface polishing procedure, the surface properties of the specimens were evaluated using surface roughness measurements by a profilometer and hydrophobicity using water contact angle measurements. To assess bacterial adhesion, the number of S. mutans bacteria was calculated from colony-forming units (CFU). Confocal laser scanning microscope analysis was done for qualitative & quantitative assessment. The data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test to compare the mean values of surface roughness, water contact angle and CFU values. To compare the mean dead cell percentage Kruskal-Wallis rank test and Conover test were used. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was used to report the statistical significance. Results Z350 and ACT had the smoothest surfaces, followed by CN, and the roughest surface was seen in FUJI-II-LC. The lowest water contact angles were seen in CN, and Z350, and the highest were in ACT. S. mutans counts were the highest in ACT and the lowest in Z350 and CN. CN and Fuji-II-LC registered the highest percentage of dead bacterial cells, while the lowest were in ACT. Significance Surface properties did not significantly influence bacterial adhesion. More S. mutans bacteria accumulated on ACT than on the nanofilled composite and on CN. CN had antibacterial effects against Streptococcus mutans biofilms.","","Resin composites, Ion release, Surface properties, , Confocal laser scanning microscopy","",""

Methods A 14-item validated survey questionnaire was mailed to directors/coordinators of operative/restorative dentistry teachers of Brazilian Dental Schools. Data were collected on demographic characteristics of the teachers and institutions, together with questions on the teaching of the repair of defective resin-based composite restorations as part of the school curriculum; the rationale behind the teaching; the nature of the teaching (preclinical and/or clinical); how techniques were taught, indications for repair, operative techniques, materials used, patient acceptability and expected longevity of completed repairs. Results Two hundred and twenty-two (94%) directors/ coordinators of dental curricula in Brazil were contacted. One hundred and thirty-one directors/coordinators (59%) replied, providing the e-mail address from the teacher responsible for the operative/restorative dentistry program in their school. Of these, 104 responded to the questionnaire (79% response rate). Ninety-three (89%) of the participating schools reported teaching composite repairs as an alternative to replacing restorations. Of the theoretical content, 43% was taught at preclinical and clinical levels, whereas most practical experience (53%) was acquired at clinical levels. Eighty-eight schools (95%) reported tooth substance preservation being the main reason for teaching repair techniques. All schools that taught repairs reported high patient acceptability. Conclusions The teaching of composite restoration repair as an alternative to restoration replacement is established in undergraduate programs in most of the Brazilian dental schools surveyed. Clinical significance The reasons for teaching restoration repair in Brazil were found to be quite unanimous among teachers, especially regarding the preservation of tooth structure. Variations were found in the clinical indications for repair, suggesting the need for further investigations. Monitoring repaired restorations should be encouraged and could contribute to future studies.","","Composite resins, Decision-making, Questionnaire, Restoration repair, Teaching","",""

Responses were compiled in Excel and analysed. Results Thirty-three schools responded to the survey, resulting in a response rate of 87 %. All dental schools indicated teaching of 2- and 3-surface posterior composite restorations. About one third only of the preclinical teaching is assigned to teaching posterior composite restorations, while the vast majority of posterior restorations placed by students in their clinical instruction are composite (89.6 ± 9.3 %). Most dental schools teach few contraindications to posterior composites, except for adverse reactions such as allergies. All dental schools consider moisture control to be important, while approaches to the management of exposed dentine differ. Conclusions The teaching of the placement of posterior composite restorations is common to all the dental schools in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland which participated in the present study. Most aspects of the teaching were found to be consistent amongst the schools. However, marked variations were observed in respect of operative techniques for the placement of posterior composites.

Methods All teeth that were restored in combination with indirect restorations and DME between 2007 and 2016 were eligible for inclusion. Overall cumulative survival rates were calculated (Kaplan–Meier estimates) and compared among subsets of variables. Qualitative evaluation of all surviving restorations was performed using the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria using Chi-square tests.

Materials University clinics in Croatia, Serbia, Italy and Turkey participated. Pairs of GH (EQUIA Forte, GC) and a nano-hybrid CO (TetricEvoCeram, IvoclarVivadent) were randomly placed in occlusal-proximal two-surfaced cavities in permanent molars of adults (n = 180/360 patients/molars). We used 3-years interim data for this evaluation. FDI-2 criteria were applied and teeth requiring repair, re-restoration, endodontic treatment or extraction recorded. Our outcome was the time until any or major complications (requiring endodontic treatment or extraction) occurred. Costs were calculated in US Dollar (USD) 2018, with the local currencies being converted using Purchasing Power Parities. To estimate initial and re-treatment costs, a payers’ perspective was taken and direct medical costs estimated from fee item catalogues. Incremental-cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were used to express the cost difference per gained or lost effectiveness. Results Overall costs were lower for GH than CO in Croatia, Turkey and Serbia, while this difference was minimal in Italy. GH tended to survive longer than CO in Croatia and Italy, and shorter in Serbia and Turkey; overall survival time was not significantly different (p = 0.67/log-rank). The cost-effectiveness differences indicated CO to be more expensive at limited (ICER: 268.5 USD/month without any complications) or no benefit at all (-186.2 USD/month without major complications). Conclusions GH was less costly than CO both initially and over 3 years. Efficacy differences were extremely limited. Clinical significance Given their low initial costs and as efficacy between GH and CO did not differ significantly, GH had a high chance of being more cost-effective within this specific trial.","","Caries, Clinical studies, Dental materials, Economic evaluation, Health services research","",""

Methods One hundred and forty-one specimens (10 × 10 × 1.5 mm3) were fabricated from KATANATM zirconia blocks and contaminated with human saliva or sheep blood. Six cleaning measures were examined: water-rinse, H3PO4, 5.25% NaOCl, ZirCleanTM, Ivoclean and KATANATM Cleaner. Tensile bond strength was evaluated for 13 groups (N=10): six cleaning measures against two contaminations (12 experimental groups) and one uncontaminated control group. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the control and water-rinsed specimen surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to identify carbon (C1s), nitrogen (N1s), phosphorous (P2p) and zirconium (Zr3d) peaks, from which the elemental ratios C/Zr, N/Zr and P/Zr were calculated. Results Although water-rinsing removed most of the contaminants from the zirconia surface, bond strength of resin cement was significantly lower compared with the control. Phosphoric acid was ineffective and NaOCl was less reliable in restoring bond strength. The three commercial cleaners (ZirCleanTM, Ivoclean, KATANATM Cleaner) out-performed the other cleaning measures and restored the bond strength of resin cement to zirconia except for the use of ZircleanTM on blood-contaminated surfaces. N/Zr decreased for all cleaned specimens and P/Zr ratio increased for phosphoric acid and KATANATM Cleaner groups. Differences in elemental ratios could indicate different cleaning mechanisms for the zirconia cleaners. Conclusion All three commercial zirconia cleaners are effective in decontaminating saliva-contaminated or blood-contaminated zirconia and increasing the bond strength of resin cement to contaminated zirconia. Clinical significance The use of water, phosphoric acid or concentrated sodium hypochorite for cleaning saliva- or blood-contaminated dental zirconia is not recommended. ZirCleanTM works well on decontamination of saliva-contaminated zirconia. Ivoclean or KATANATM Cleaner are useful for decontamination of both saliva- and blood-contaminated zirconia during the intraoral try-in stage to recover the original bond strength of cementation.","","Blood, Cleaner, Contamination, Saliva, Zirconia","",""

Methods Full-mouth (pre-treatment) grading was performed on digital greyscale scan records for 34 participants (35.3 ± 8.4 years) with signs of moderate-to-severe generalised tooth wear, using the Tooth Wear Evaluation System and the Basic Erosive Wear Examination. Each participant received full-mouth direct resin composite restorations, with increased VDO. The post-treatment increase in the VDO was determined. Recalls were planned after 1 month, and after 1, 3, and 5 years. Three ‘levels’ of restoration failure were described. The effects of the variables on the frequencies of restoration failure were calculated with a multivariable Cox regression, (p < 0.05). Results 1269 restorations were placed with a mean observation period of 62.4 months. Increasing the VDO by 1 mm significantly reduced the risks of all levels of anterior restoration failure (HR ≤ 0.62, p ≤ 0.025).

Gloss changes ranged from -5.7 to -1.6 GU after coffee immersion, from -2.3 to 0.1 GU after thermocycling and from -4.4 to 0.5 GU after photoaging. No significant differences in gloss changes were found among materials after aging (p>0.05). Tetric CAD demonstrated the significantly lower gloss and the higher surface roughness after polishing. Except for gloss after thermocycling, aging procedures caused significant alteration of gloss and surface roughness parameters from baseline levels. Conclusions Aging procedures caused perceptible but acceptable color changes and small but visible gloss changes, while surface roughness parameters of the tested CAD/CAM composite materials were significantly affected by aging. Clinical significance Aging procedures affected CAD/CAM composite materials indicating that these materials may be prone to color and surface alterations in the oral environment that could compromise the esthetics and the performance of the restorations. Clinical studies are needed to investigate the long-term behavior of the newly introduced CAD/CAM materials.","","CAD/CAM, composite resins, color stability, gloss, surface roughness, aging","",""

Relative translucency parameter was calculated using ΔE00 (RTP00). Translucency differences were evaluated using published data of 50:50% translucency perceptibility (TPT00) and acceptability (TAT00) thresholds. Scattering (S) and absorption (K) coefficients and transmittance (T%) were calculated using Kubelka–Munk's equations. Data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis, Mann–Whitney tests, and VAF coefficient. Results The RTP00 values of the 17 evaluated shades ranged from 8.69 to 21.34. There were perceptible translucency differences (TPT00=0.62) between different shades of the same brand and between composites designated with the same shade of different brands. Spectral distributions of S, K and T were wavelength-dependent. Although the spectral behavior of the S and K coefficients and T% were similar for all the gingival composites evaluated, the values of these parameters presented statistically significant differences between shades, which would justify the differences found in the relative translucency parameter. Conclusions The optical properties S, K and T% of GCRBCs were significantly different, resulting in perceptible translucency differences between the same shade of different commercial brands and between different shades of the same brand.

Methods Real-time linear shrinkage and shrinkage force of 1.5 mm thick composite specimens were measured for 15 min after the start of light-curing using custom-made devices. From the shrinkage force data, maximum shrinkage force rate and time to achieve maximum shrinkage force rate were determined. Degree of conversion was measured using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. Results Flowable composites showed significantly higher linear shrinkage compared to sculptable composites (1.93–2.91 % vs. 1.15–1.54 %), as well as significantly higher shrinkage forces (18.7–24.4 N vs. 13.5–17.0 N). Degree of conversion amounted to 45.8–60.1 %. For high-intensity curing, degree of conversion was significantly lower in three out of seven composites, whereas shrinkage forces were either increased, decreased, or unchanged compared to conventional curing. For high-intensity curing, maximum shrinkage rates were 6–61 % higher, whereas times to achieve maximum shrinkage force rate were 15–53 % shorter compared to conventional curing. Composites specifically designed for high-intensity curing showed shrinkage parameters comparable to other investigated composites. Conclusion Shrinkage behavior under conditions of high-intensity light-curing was material-dependent. Shrinkage force kinetics were more strongly affected by high-intensity curing than absolute values of linear shrinkage and shrinkage force.

Material and Methods Futurabond U was applied in NCCLs of 50 subjects using four adhesion strategies (n = 50 restorations per group): only self-etch (SEE); selective enamel etching + self-etch (SET); etch-and-rinse with dry dentin (ERDry); and etch-and-rinse with wet dentin (ERWet). All cavities were restored using Admira Fusion composite resin (Voco). Restorations were evaluated after 36 months using the World Federation criteria (FDI) and the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Results The after 36-month retention rates were 87% (75–92%) for SEE, 94% (83–98%) for SET, 91% (80–97%) for ERDry, and 94% (83–98%) for ERWet. Forty-three restorations were considered to have minor discrepancies in marginal adaptation at the 36-month recall (18 for SEE, 12 for SET, 7 for ERDry, and 6 for ERWet; p > 0.05). One restoration was detected as a minor marginal discoloration at the 36-month recall (1 for SET; p > 0.05). No restorations showed postoperative sensitivity and caries recurrence at 36 months. Conclusion The clinical performance of the Futurabond U did not depend on the employed bonding strategy, and it was considered reliable after 36 months of clinical evaluation. However, greater marginal discrepancy was observed in the self-etch groups. Clinical Relevance NCCLs restorations using a dual-cure universal adhesive in self-etch and etch-and-rinse modes showed satisfactory clinical performance after 36 months.","","Clinical trial, Dental bonding, Dentin-bonding agents, Non-carious cervical lesions, Adhesive techniques, Self etching, Dental restorations, Clinical longevity","",""

Methods The study involved repairing 130 Class I and II defective composite restorations. After recurrent caries removal, the repair process included etching with 37 % phosphoric acid, Adper Single Bond 2 application for bonding and Filtek Z250 composite for restoring all defects. The restoration surfaces were subjected to one of the following additional surface treatments within the repair process: Control: No additional treatment; the Silane-Adhesive treatment: A separate step involved the application of a silane coupling agent after acid etching; and the Sandblast-Silane-Adhesive treatment: included intra-oral sandblasting of old composite surfaces followed by silane application. Two calibrated examiners evaluated all repaired restorations according to a modified USPHS criteria after 6 months. Comparisons of the clinical performance between the treatment groups were made using Chi-square test, while responses to cold tests before and after repair treatment were made using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank's (α = 0.05). Results Of 130 cases, only 116 cases turned up for evaluation. The primary reasons for composite repair were recurrent caries and anatomical deficiencies. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for all clinical criteria (p > 0.05). The control group experienced one total and two partial retention losses. Conclusions The application of a silane coupling agent, with or without intra-oral sandblasting, demonstrated no improvement on the clinical performance of repaired posterior composites after 6-months. Clinical significance Surface treatment of defective composite restorations using silane with intra-oral sandblasting within their repair process offered marginal improvement in their clinical performance over conventional etching technique, but insignificantly so.

However, their long-term durability in thermal cycling is unclear. The objectives of this study were to develop an antibacterial, remineralizing and low-shrinkage-stress composite, and to investigate its durability in thermal cycling for 20,000 cycles, equivalent to two years of clinical life. Methods The resin consisted of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and triethylene glycol divinylbenzyl ether (TEG-DVBE). Composites were made with 5% dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and 20% of nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP). Composites were thermal cycled at 5°C and 55°C for 20,000 cycles. A human salivary biofilm model was used to evaluate antibiofilm activity before and after thermal cycling. Results After 20,000 cycles, the flexural strength of bioactive low-shrinkage-stress composite matched commercial control with no antibacterial activity (p > 0.05). Surface roughness was clinically acceptable at less than 0.2 μm. UV+NACP+DMAHDM composite reduced the total microorganisms, total streptococci, and mutans streptococci by 2-5 logs, compared to commercial composite. Biofilm lactic acid production was reduced by 11 folds. The antibacterial performance was maintained after thermal cycling, with no decrease after 20,000 cycles. Conclusions Bioactive low-shrinkage-stress composite possessed good mechanical properties that matched commercial composite both before and after thermal cycling. The new composite had potent antibacterial activity, which was maintained and did not decrease after thermal cycling. Clinical significance The new bioactive low-shrinkage-stress composite could reduce polymerization shrinkage stress and release calcium and phosphate ions, with good mechanical properties and strong antibacterial function that were durable after thermal cycling. These properties indicate great potential for inhibiting recurrent caries and increasing the restoration longevity.","","Dental nanocomposite, Low shrinkage stress, Calcium phosphate nanoparticles, Thermal cycling, Secondary caries","",""

Methods A multi-national (Croatia, Serbia, Italy, Turkey) split-mouth randomized trial comparing GH and CO in occlusal-proximal two-surfaced cavities in permanent molars (n=180/360 patients/molars) provided data on restoration failure and allocation probabilities (i.e. failure requiring re-restoration, repair or endodontic therapy). Using Markov modelling, we followed molars over the lifetime of an initially 12-years-old individual. Our health outcome was the time a tooth was retained. A mixed-payers’ perspective within German healthcare was used to determine costs (in Euro 2018) using fee item catalogues. Monte-Carlo-microsimulations, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER)s and cost-effectiveness-acceptability were quantified. Results In the base-case scenario, CO was more effective (tooth retention for a mean (SD) 54.4 (1.7) years) but also more costly (694 (54) Euro) than GH (53.9 (1.7) years; 614 (56 Euro). The ICER was 158 Euro/year, i.e. payers needed to be willing to invest 158 Euro per additional year of tooth retention when using CO. In a sensitivity analysis, this finding was confirmed or GH found more effective and less costly. Conclusion CO was more costly and limitedly more effective than GH, and while there is uncertainty around our findings, GH is likely a cost-effectiveness option for restoring permanent molars. Clinical significance When considering the long-term (life-time) cost-effectiveness, GH showed cost savings but CO was limitedly more effective.

Data In vitro studies that compared the antibacterial effects of resin-based restorative dental materials with and without antibacterial additives were screened. Risk bias was assessed, and the following data were extracted: antibacterial additive, parental dental material, curing mode, bacterial growth outcome assessment, samples used as a substrate for bacterial growth, inoculum complexity, and culture time as an indicator of biofilm maturity. Source Arksey and O’Malley’s five stages framework using Medline (OVID), EMBASE, and Scopus (Elsevier) databases guided this review. Study selection From 6503 studies initially identified, 348 studies were considered eligible for full-text screening, and 153 were included for data extraction. Almost all studies have a high sampling bias related to both sample size and blindness. Quaternary ammonium monomers were the most investigated additive (45 %), and the most prevailing parental material was resin composite (49 %). There was extensive methodological heterogeneity among the studies for outcome assessment with the majority using resin composite disks (78 %), mono-species Streptococcus mutans as the inoculum (54 %), and a relatively short period of biofilm growth (≤24 h).

There is a need for efforts to improve study designs to mimic the oral environment in vivo and to develop standardized methods to help understand and optimize these materials. Clinical significance Most studies that incorporate antibacterial additives into resin-based materials claim promising results by bacterial reduction.

Study selection Quantitative studies reporting on dental schools’ teaching regarding the placement of PCRs in permanent teeth. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were performed. Risk of bias was assessed based on the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). Sources Electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched in January 2023. Data Forty sources reporting on 34 studies having surveyed 1,286 dental schools were included. Overall, 92.7% (95%-CI: 88.2-95.5) of dental schools reported to teach PCRs. PCRs in three-surface Class II cavities are taught by 82.0% (95%-CI: 70.4-89.7). The mandatory use of liners in deep cavities is taught by 78.3% (95%-CI: 68.9-85.5), and 44.0% (95%-CI: 34.3-54.2) reported to teach bulk-fill composites. While most posterior restorations placed by students were composites (56.1%; 95%-CI: 46.0-65.8), 94.7% (95%-CI: 86.6-98.0) of dental schools (still) teach posterior amalgam restorations. The proportion of dental schools teaching PCRs in three-surface Class II cavities increased and the mean proportion of PCRs among all posterior restorations increased over time (padj.≤0.003). Conclusions The teaching of PCRs in dental schools around the world reflects the increased use of resin composite in clinical practice, with students in countries where dental amalgam continues to be used, placing more posterior composites than restorations of dental amalgam. The teaching of PCRs, which is anticipated to increase, will continue to be refined with further developments in adhesive materials, devices, instrumentation, and techniques. Clinical significance Graduating dentists can be expected to be familiar with the use of resin composites for the restoration of posterior teeth.","","Education, Minimally invasive dentistry, Operative dentistry, Posterior composites, Systematic review, Teaching","",""

Methods A total of 95 posterior monolithic zirconia tooth-elements in 45 patients were evaluated, 85 on implants and 10 on natural teeth, and 20.3% of restorations being fixed partial dentures (FPDs). Occlusal contact point areas were determined and half of those areas were left unglazed and just polished. Restorations were clinically evaluated following criteria of the World Dental Federation and antagonistic teeth were examined at each evaluation time. Wear ex vivo analyses using SEM and 3D laser profilometry were performed at baseline and after 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years respectively, temporarily removing the prostheses. Results The Kaplan-Meier survival rate of restorations was 93.3% (100% for FPDs) and the success rate was 81.8%, with 4 abutment debondings, 3 tooth-supported crown debondings (provisional cement use), 1 restoration fracture, 1 minor chipping, 1 core fracture, 1 root fracture, and 2 implant losses. 80% of catastrophic failures occurred in patients with clinical signs of bruxism (61.7% of patients). Complications were also observed on antagonistic teeth (3 catastrophic failures). Clinical evaluation of the restorations showed good results from the aesthetic, functional, and biological perspective. Zirconia wear was inferior to 15 μm, while glaze wear was observed on all occlusal contact areas after 1 year. Conclusions Monolithic zirconia FPDs are promising but the failure rate of single-unit restorations was not as high as expected in this sample including patients with bruxism clinical signs. Clinical significance Within study limitations, FPDs showed excellent short-term results but further research is needed for single-unit restorations considering samples, which do not exclude bruxers. The weak link is the restoration support or the antagonist tooth, one hypothesis being that zirconia stiffness and lack of resilience do not promote occlusal stress damping.","","Dental prosthesis, Zirconia, Computer-Aided design/Computer-Aided manufacturing, Wear","",""

Material specimens were immersed in lactic acid (pH = 4.0) and artificial saliva (pH = 6.4). Ion concentrations (atomic absorption spectrometry for Ca, UV–vis spectrometry for PO4, and ion-selective electrode for F) and pH were measured after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 days. After immersion, composite specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Results Material-dependent concentrations of Ca, PO4, and F were measured in the lactic acid solution, while a decrease of Ca and PO4 concentrations was observed in artificial saliva. The uptake of ions from artificial saliva indicates their precipitation on specimen surfaces, which was supported by the results of SEM and FTIR investigations. In experimental composites functionalized with both bioactive glass types and a commercial “alkasite” material, apatite was precipitated not only in artificial saliva but also in the lactic acid solution. Conclusions Experimental BG-containing composites and selected commercial restorative materials demonstrated the potential for releasing multiple ion types and increasing pH.

Therefore, this study aimed to quantify BPA present as an impurity and to evaluate whether their degradation by salivary, bacterial, and chemical challenges could increase its release. Methods BPA was determined in three different amounts (300, 400, and 500 µg) of eight unpolymerized resin-based materials (four composites, one fissure sealant, two adhesives and one root canal sealer). Next, polymerized samples (n = 5) of each material were immersed in 1 mL of whole human pooled saliva collected from adults, Streptococcus mutans (2 × 107 CFU/mL), and acidic (0.1 M HCl), alkaline (0.1 M NaOH), and control media, respectively. The amount of BPA was quantified using an UPLC-MS/MS method including derivatization of BPA by pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride. Results Only the composites contained trace amounts of BPA above the limit of quantification (ranging from 301±32 pg PBA/mg to 1534±62 pg BPA/mg), most likely as impurity from the synthesis of the monomers. The amounts of BPA released from polymerized materials upon salivary and bacterial degradation were too low for accurate quantification, but in water, quantifiable amounts of BPA were released from all materials. In alkaline media, the BPA release from two composites was significantly decreased, while the release from one adhesive was significantly increased, compared to water. Conclusions BPA already present in unpolymerized resin-based materials may account for the release of BPA after polymerization. There was no clear indication that short-term material degradation leads to increased release of BPA.","","Resin-based dental materials, Composite, Bisphenol A, Endocrine disruptor, Degradation","",""

This study tests the antibacterial properties of a novel bulk-fill flowable composite (Infinx™, Nobio™ Ltd.) containing quaternary ammonium silica (QASi) filler particles. Methods Infinix™ was tested in-vitro by the direct contact test (DCT), using E. faecalis or whole saliva as inoculum. A similar formula composite without QASi served as a control. In addition, composite test samples were polymerized on three volunteers' intact buccal enamel surfaces of mandibular first premolars in a split-mouth design experiment. Traditional composite served as control (Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable, 3M). Bacterial viability on the composite surfaces weres assessed ex-vivo microscopically six months later, using a fluorescent dead/live stain. Images of each bacterial sample were taken using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i), and further live/total cell analysis was performed using ImageJ software. Results Following direct contact with one week of aged Infinix, more than 1 million E. faecalis bacteria were killed. Similarly, when using the saliva as inoculum, no single microorganism survived. Six-month in-vivo experiments supported these results by showing a reduction of 54%, 30% and 28% in live/total number of bacteria ratio retrieved from antibacterial composite vs. the control in volunteers #1, #2, #3 respectively. Conclusion Within the limitations of the experimental design, the present study suggest that antibacterial activity of quaternary ammonium silica particles (QASi) is comparable to that of previously described quaternary ammonium polyethyleneimine particles (QPEI). In addition, whole saliva bacteria are effectively killed by QASi-containing composite in-vitro and in-vivo, for a period of six month at least. Long-term full-scale clinical study is needed to confirm the findings of the present study and their implication on maintaining health balance.

Methods Standardized mesio-occlusal and disto-occlusal cavities were prepared on 20 human molars. Teeth were randomly allocated to two protocols according to the positioning of contoured sectional metal matrices before (M->A, n = 10), or after adhesive application (A->M, n = 10). Both adhesive systems were additioned with crystal violet dye (CV, 10 vol%). Specimen sections were evaluated using optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Dynamic viscosity, pH, microshear bond strength test (μ-SBS) on enamel and dentin, and three-point bend test (3PB) of polymerized adhesive rods, were performed on both pristine and CV-additioned adhesives. Results M->A produced a layer of adhesive both on tooth-restoration interface and on external restoration surfaces in contact with the matrix. A->M produced a thin layer of adhesive on external tooth surfaces, well beyond cavity and RBC restoration margins. In all restorations, excess RBC material with uneven margins was observed protruding over the cervical margin. CV addition slightly increased pH and decreased viscosity. μ-SBS: CU + CV showed a 10-fold reduction in adhesion forces on dentine. 3PB: CSE yielded higher flexural strength values than CU.

The results were examined versus tooth location, number of restored surfaces, type of restoration, and filling material. Results The dentists examined 4,612 dental restorations, of which 4,185 direct fillings mainly with resin composite materials (2,555). Of all restorations, 2,048 (44.4%) were considered as failures, of which 1,489 had one or two criteria for ‘clinically unsatisfactory/poor restoration’. As simplified, the esthetic criterion ‘color match’ was the most frequent criterion for failure (912 cases). The rate of restoration failures was found associated with the number of surfaces restored and the use of glass-ionomer cement. Results are not comparable with others obtained with original FDI criteria. Conclusions Assessing dental restorations with the original FDI criteria leads generally to much more failure statements than practitioners’ decisions to reintervene. Though requiring some adjustment (e.g., regarding ‘color match’), the simplified assessment proved convenient and amenable to standardization.

The flexural strength, FS, and modulus, E, were measured with a span of 12 mm (NIST) or 20 mm (ISO). A fractographic analysis determined the origin of fracture. One and multiple-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc tests (α = 0.05), Weibull statistics and Pearson correlation analysis were used for data analysis.

A positive control group was also used. Resin composite identical to the substrate was applied and the repaired specimens were subjected to shear bond strength (SBS) testing. Representative samples from all groups were subjected to scanning electron microscopy and surface profilometry to determine their mode of failure. The data were analysed statistically using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and two independent sample t-test (α = 0.05). Results The mean SBS of all test groups ranged between 1.92 and 5.40 MPa and varied with the degree of composite surface roughness and the type of adhesive system employed. Significantly highest SBS values (5.40 ± 0.36 MPa) were obtained in Group 5 (p = 0.017) which were comparable to the coherent strength of the resin composite in the positive control group (p > 0.05).

Methods Posterior dental cavities of 72 participants (n = 236), with a cavity depth of at least 3 mm, were randomly divided into four groups. The restorations were bonded using either the Tetric N-Bond ER or Tetric N-Bond SE. The composite resin Tetric N-Ceram Bulk-Fill was placed either IF or using BF. Two experienced and calibrated examiners evaluated the restorations using FDI criteria in the baseline and after 12, 24 and 36-month.

Methods A randomized controlled split-mouth and blinded trial was carried out. Patients (n = 38) with at least two NCCLs were included. Before the cervical restoration placement, the NCCLs (181 teeth) were randomly allocated into two treatment groups according to the tooth isolation techniques: cotton roll or rubber dam. Experienced, trained, blinded, and calibrated examiners performed periodontal evaluations at baseline and 5-year follow-up, using a periodontal probe. Restorations were assessed with the FDI criteria. Thirty-two patients (154 teeth) were evaluated at 5 years. The occurrence/progression of GR between baseline and follow-up was considered the primary outcome. The relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) were calculated by Poisson regression (α < 0.05). Results After 5 year, 31 teeth (13.6 %) presented occurrence/progression of GR. In the multivariate analyses, the occurrence/progression of GR was associated with the use of rubber dam isolation (RR; 95 %CI: 2.65; 1.01–7.00) and a lack of marginal adaptation of the restoration (RR; 95 %CI: 10.98; 2.31–52.30). Toothbrush stiffness, use of abrasive dentifrice, tooth type, and the presence of biofilm or gingivitis did not present a statistically significant higher risk for occurrence/progression of GR. Conclusion The use of rubber dam isolation associated with retraction clamp and the lack of a proper marginal adaptation of the composite restorations are risk indicators for the occurrence/progression of GR in individuals who received a restoration for an NCCL.

This article focuses on dental composites with azole functional groups incorporated to affect their physicochemical and mechanical properties and antibacterial activity. Methods Dental composites were fabricated by embedding the functionalized imidazole and benzimidazole nanoparticles into a Bis-GMA/TEGDMA matrix to form the imidazole and benzimidazole dental composites series (I and B). The material was produced through hand blending of the monomer (50:50, wt%), filler (0–30, wt%), and initiator combination (CQ/EDMAB:0.8:1.6, wt%), and LED light-curing unit for 60 s. Results Using various characterization techniques, I and B series were validated. The dental composites' approximate solubility and sorption significances were evaluated by conducting experiments on specific dental composite formulations. Fenton reaction test was performed to determine the chemical stability of the dental composites. The mechanical properties of the dental composites were investigated. Finally, by testing cell growth in the presence of composites, their antibacterial activities were determined. Conclusions In this study, it was observed that the mechanical, physiochemical, and antibacterial properties of the functional azole-containing nanoparticles were positively improved by adding them to the structure of dental composites. These experimental results paved the way for the synthesized materials to be used in industrial applications. Clinical Significance Since the chemical, mechanical, and antimicrobial properties of dental composites containing 10% imidazole and benzimidazole functional nanoparticles are far superior, they constitute an excellent alternative for preventing dental caries and long-term use of dental composites.","","Bis-GMA, TEGDMA, Imidazole, Benzimidazole, SiO, Functional nanoparticles","",""

Methods The base resin was formulated mixing 60 wt.% of bisphenol A glycol dimethacrylate and 40 wt.% of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate with photoinitiator/co/initiator system. TAT was added at 2.5 (G2.5%) or 5 (G5%) wt.%, and a group without TAT was used as control (Gctrl). The resins were analyzed for degree of conversion (DC), Knoop hardness (KHN), softening in solvent (ΔKHN), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), contact angle, surface free energy (SFE), antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation, and cytotoxicity against human keratinocytes. Results There was no difference for the DC (p = 0.676). The addition of TAT at 5 wt.% induced higher KHN (p<0.001), higher resistance against softening in solvent (p<0.001), and higher UTS (p = 0.04). There were no statistically significant differences for contact angle with water (p = 0.106), α-bromonaphtalene (p = 0.454), and SFE (p = 0.172).

Conclusions The addition of 2.5 wt.% of TAT is suitable for conveying antibacterial activity for dental resins without changing the physicochemical properties or impairing the cytotoxic effect. Clinical relevance Methacrylate monomers that decrease bacterial viability and copolymerize with the resin matrix are exciting approaches to developing therapeutic materials. TAT showed promising properties to may hamper and prevent carious lesions when incorporated into dental materials.

Methods : The respective effect of NaF and DCV on adhesive curing kinetic, antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Bacterial Flora of Human saliva (HSBF) were comprehensively evaluated. Then, the synergistic effects of NaF nanoparticles and DCV on adhesive performance were studied in terms of fluoride ion (F-) release, antibacterial activity, hydrophilicity, surface potential, cytotoxicity, and bonding strength. Results : DCV monomer could polymerize with other adhesive monomers without influencing C = C double conversion rate, while the addition amount of DCV would affect the hydrophilicity and bonding strength of the cured adhesives. The cationic quaternary ammonium group could reduce the burst release of negative F− for the adhesive at a NaF/DCV ratio (1:1, 2%), hence achieving both non-contact and contact antibacterial activity in an extended term without causing cytotoxicity. Conclusion : Mixing NaF nanoparticles and DCV into the dental resin adhesive can slow down the initial burst release of F− and prolong the release-type antibacterial effect. The ionic interaction between F− and quaternary ammonium groups, as well as, the effect of DCV on adhesive hydrophilicity, simultaneously influence the release behavior of F−. Co-incorporation of quanternary ammonium and fluoride improves adhesive's antibacterial performance for dental application. Clinical Significance : Incorporating both NaF nanoparticles and DCV into dental resin adhesive could provide an efficient strategy for dental restoration as well as the prevention of secondary caries.","","Dental resin adhesive, Sodium fluoride, Quaternary ammonium salt, Sustained release, Antibacterial activity","",""

Study selection Randomized controlled studies with minimum 2 years follow-up, comparing different adhesive strategies and/or restorative materials in permanent teeth were included. Our outcome was the occurrence of secondary caries. Bayesian pairwise and network-meta-analysis were conducted. Data We included 50 trials; 19 assessing secondary caries depending on different adhesive strategies, 31 on restorative materials. Studies were published between 2005 and 2017, largely of unclear risk of bias, and included a mean of 40 (range: 8–90) participants and 46 (range: 14–200) placed restorations. Mean follow-up was 43 (range: 24–180) months. Secondary caries was a rare event; the majority of studies did not find any lesions. Network meta-analysis found great uncertainty. 3-step etch-and-rinse adhesives showed the lowest risk of secondary caries, 2-step etch-and-rinse the highest. For restorative materials, resin-modified glass ionomer showed the lowest risk of secondary caries. Most resin composites showed similar risks. Conclusion Data from randomized trials comparing different adhesive strategies or restorative materials are extremely scarce. The differences between materials were limited over the observational period of the included studies. The yielded rankings should be interpreted with caution.

Methods A 24-item validated questionnaire including closed and open questions on the teaching of posterior composites was emailed to faculty members in all 13 Dental Schools in Malaysia. Responses were compiled on Excel and analysed. Results All 13 dental schools responded to the survey yielding a 100 % response. All schools indicated the use of posterior composites for 2- and 3-surface cavities in premolars and molars. The didactic teaching time devoted to composites was greater than for amalgam (38 h vs 29 h). Clinically, most posterior restorations placed by students were composites (average 74.1 %, range 10 %–100 %); the remaining 25.9 % were amalgams (range, 0 %–50 %). Slot-type cavities were the preparation techniques most commonly taught (n = 11,84.6 %). The use of rubber dam for moisture control was mandatory in most schools (n = 11, 84.6 %).

Results A total of 1086 patients had at least one posterior composite placed between 2007 and 2018. This amounted to 3194 restorations placed of which 308 had a re-intervention within the 11-year period. For all restorations, the annual failure rate at 1 year was 5.73 %, at 5 years was 16.78 % and at 10 years was 18.74 %. A logistic regression showed that when compared to the least deprived 5th quintile, the most deprived 1st and 2nd quintiles were significantly less likely to have a re-intervention, being 49.2 % (p = 0.022) and 53.2 % (p = 0.031) less likely, respectively.

The objectives of this study were to investigate a dual strategy of combining rnc gene-deletion for Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) with antibacterial dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) composite, and determine the effects of rnc gene-deletion alone, DMAHDM composite alone, and rnc-deletion plus DMAHDM composite, on biofilm growth and lactic acid production. Methods Parent S. mutans (UA159, ATCC 700610) and rnc-deleted S. mutans were used. DMAHDM was incorporated into a composite at mass fractions of 0%, 1.5%, and 3%. Gene expressions for biofilm formation and drug resistance were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Biofilms were grown on composite surfaces for 2 days. Live/dead, biomass, polysaccharide, metabolic activity (MTT), colony-forming units (CFU) and lactic acid production of biofilms were evaluated. Results Compared to the parent S. mutans, the rnc-deletion technique yielded significantly less biofilm biomass, polysaccharides, metabolic activity, CFU, and lactic acid for biofilms grown on control composite (p <  0.05). With no gene modification, the biofilm CFU was decreased by 5–6 logs at 3% DMAHDM, when compared to control composite group. The dual strategy of combining rnc-deletion with 3% DMAHDM composite achieved the strongest biofilm-inhibition, with the greatest reduction in CFU by 8 logs. The combination of rnc-deletion with 3% DMAHDM composite decreased the biofilm lactic acid production by 95% (p <  0.05). Conclusions The dual strategy of rnc-deletion plus DMAHDM composite produced synergistic effects and achieved the strongest biofilm-inhibition. This method has great potential to inhibit dental caries and is promising to reduce secondary caries and protect tooth structures.",""," gene modification, Dental composite, Dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate, Biofilm growth, Acid production, Recurrent caries","",""

Methods A cross-sectional, online survey-based study was carried out amongst 378 GDPs - members of the dental practice-based research network in France (ReCOL). Bivariate comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test to assess the association of the respondent characteristics (age, gender…) with the decision to repair DRs, and responses to clinical cases. Results The response rate was 82.9%. 50.4% of the respondents declared they at least sometimes consider DRs repair in their clinical practice instead of DRs total replacement. For the 89.8% who at least rarely repaired DRs, the main characteristic determining the therapeutic strategy was the defect size (71%, mainly inclined to repair small defects), followed by the defect type (marginal defect or crack for more than 60% of the respondents) and the material of initial restoration (composite for 63.5%). When shown clinical photographs illustrating DRs, most of respondents proposed a replacement with inlay/onlay or crown. Conclusions This study indicates that a significant proportion of French GDPs do not make sufficient use of DR repair on a routine basis. A lack of knowledge of the concept seems to explain at least part of this situation. Collective and individual efforts from the profession are still needed to promote DR repair and therefore more often apply MinimalIntervention Dentistry. Clinical significance This survey shows that MID is not yet sufficiently used in routine practice in France regarding DR management. Further efforts (continuing education toward MID, public funding revaluation for MID strategies…) are needed to help GDPs to implement MID into everyday practice.","","Questionnaire survey, Defective restorations, France, General dental practitioners, Practice-based research network, Minimal intervention dentistry (MID)","",""

We aimed to systematically assess the consistency and quality of repair protocols. Data 808 records were initially identified and 71 repair protocols based on 84 sources included. The number of published sources over time increased exponentially (p < 0.001). Recommended treatment steps varied widely. Some treatment steps were only recommended by a minority of protocols, while others were consistently recommended (e.g. surface roughening, hydrofluoric acid etching of silicate ceramics, application of an adhesive/bonding agent). The overall quality of included sources was moderate (mean ± SD 3.7 ± 0.9 out of 7 points).

Methods A total of 84 class II bulk-fill resin composite (Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill) restorations were placed in 35 participants by one operator using the universal adhesive's (Adhese Universal VivaPen) etch-and-rinse or self-etch mode randomly. The restorations were evaluated by two calibrated examiners at baseline and after 6-, 12-, 24-, 36- and 48-month using modified USPHS criteria. The comparison of the two adhesive strategies for each evaluation criteria was performed with the chi-square test. The baseline scores were compared with those at the recalls using the Friedman and Cochran's Q-test (p < .05). Results At 48-month, 74 restorations were evaluated in 30 participants (recall rate: 85.7%). Marginal discoloration was statistically more frequent in SE approach (p < .05), whereas no significant difference was observed between the two strategies in terms of marginal adaptation (p > .05).

Methods This study encompassed two sections. First, an anonymous electronic survey was submitted via Google forms to Italian dentists to acquire information about composite handling during clinical procedures. Then, a bench test was performed on nanohybrid RBCs differing in matrix chemistry and fillers [FiltekTM Supreme XTE (3MTM); Venus Pearl (Kulzer GmbH); Admira Fusion x-tra (Voco)] to evaluate the microbial viability on their surfaces with/out photocuring. Uncured RBCs were exposed to standardized inocula of Streptococcus Mutans, Candida Albicans, Lactobacillus Rhamnosus, or mixt plaque in an in vitro model reproducing clinical restorative procedures. Half of the RBC specimens were cured after exposure. Microbial viability was assessed using an MTT-based test. Statistical analysis included three-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests (p<0.05). Results Among 300 dentists completing the survey, the majority declared to use the spatula to carry the RBCs from the syringe to the dental cavity (50% same spatula; 35% two spatulas). However, 80% of respondents had personal feelings that using one spatula could be a source of cross-contamination. In vitro results using one spatula showed microbial contamination of all RBCs after one hour of storage. The contamination levels depended on the used strain and RBC type (p<0.0001), but photocuring did not reduce contamination (p = 0.2992). Conclusions Microbial species’ viability on uncured RBCs and after photocuring shows the existence of a considerable risk of cross-infection. Clinical procedures in Restorative Dentistry need to acknowledge and to reduce such risk during RBCs handling.

Methods A conventional resin-based composite (RBC - Majesty ES-2; Kuraray, Japan) and a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC – Ionolux; VOCO, Germany) were used to restore standardized class II cavities (n = 4/tooth, cervical margin in dentin) in 16 human molars. The ability to produce secondary caries with Streptococcus mutans biofilms was tested using either an open-cycle or closed-cycle bioreactor (n = 8 specimens/model). Specimens were scanned before and after the biofilm exposure using micro-CT (Skyscan 1176, 9 µm resolution, 80 kV, 300 mA). Image reconstruction was performed, and demineralization depths (µm) were evaluated at the restoration margins and a distance of 1.0 mm. Results Dentin demineralization could be observed in all specimens, and enamel demineralization in 50% of the specimens. The open system bioreactor produced lesions with significantly higher overall demineralization depths (p < .001). However, demineralization depths at a 1.0 mm distance from the restoration margins showed no difference between open and closed systems or materials. In the open system, significantly lower demineralization depths were observed in proximity to RMGIC than RBC (p < .001), which was not significantly different in the closed system (p = .382). Conclusions Both systems produced in vitro secondary caries in an accelerated way. However, the open-cycle bioreactor system confirmed the caries-protective activity exerted by the RMGIC material in contrast to the RBC, better simulating materials’ clinical behavior.

Open apices, combined surgical treatment, ETC score I, patients <18 years or with an ASA-score >2 were excluded. Cumulative survival estimates and Cox regression analysis were performed for tooth survival and endodontic healing according to the Glossary of Endodontic Terms. Restoration quality was assessed using the FDI criteria. Alpha was set at 0.05. Results 279 endodontically treated molars in 245 patients were included for survival analysis and 268 molars for endodontic success. After 89 months, the cumulative survival was 91.7 % [95 % CI: 86.8 %–94.9 %]. Absence of adjacent teeth and deviance in root canal morphology significantly decreased the probability of tooth survival.

Methods A total of 83 IPS-Empress-inlays/onlays were placed in 30 patients. Restorations were luted according to two different strategies: 43 restorations were fixed with a self-adhesive resin-cement (RelyXUnicem, RX), 40 restorations were inserted with VariolinkII-low (SV) after pretreatment with an etch-and-rinse multi-step adhesive. Recalls were performed after two weeks (n=83), two years (n= 82), four years (n=74) and 14 years (n=54). Two independent calibrated examiners evaluated all restorations using modified USPHS-criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise Mann-Whitney-U-test and Friedman-test (p < 0.05). Results After 14 years, 54 restorations in 22 patients were evaluated (eight patients equalling 29 inlays not available). Ten restorations had to be replaced (failure rate 12%); four (SV-group) showed bulk fractures and two (RX-group) exhibited marginal fractures at the 14-year recall. Overall, the SV-group revealed significantly better results regarding discoloration of the luting gap (p<0.05) compared to the RX-group. No statistically significant differences were computed between SV and RX for the remaining criteria at the respective recalls (p>0.05).

Differences in performance of the two luting methods after being challenged for 14 years in the oral environment are highlighted. However, the overarching survival rate justifies the recommendation of both methods for clinical routine.","","Ceramic, , Long-term, Clinical trial, Self-adhesive, Cement","",""

Two whitening sessions with 6% and 35% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were performed on the exposed samples. Teeth exposed to CS and EC aerosol were also brushed with whitening toothpaste for 3 weeks. Color match of resin restorations was assessed, and color changes were compared after exposure and after whitening treatments. Results Discolorations in enamel, dentin, and composite resin were observed in the order of red wine > CS > soy sauce > coffee > EC. Color mismatch between enamel and resin restorations occurred only in red wine and CS groups. Brushing with whitening toothpaste removed discoloration caused by EC aerosol; H2O2 treatments were necessary to eliminate discolorations caused by coffee and soy sauce. Discolorations of dentin and resin restorations could not be completely removed by whitening treatments, and color mismatch remained in teeth exposed to red wine and CS. Conclusion Red wine and CS cause significant tooth discoloration and color mismatch in enamel and resin restorations that are not reversible by whitening treatments. Tooth discoloration associated with EC aerosol was minimal and could be removed by brushing with whitening toothpaste. Clinical significance Red wine drinkers and cigarette smokers have increased risks for tooth discoloration and color mismatch between enamel and composite resin restorations. Whitening treatments may not be effective in correcting the color mismatch.

The most common complaints associated with tooth wear are dissatisfaction with dental appearance and a negative impact on the experienced Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL). The aim of this study was to investigate the change in OHRQoL and the perception of aesthetics, following restorative treatment of moderate to severe tooth wear patients, with a five-year follow-up. Methods An explorative study, based on prospective data, was performed. OHRQoL and the perception of aesthetics were measured with the OHIP-NL and OES-NL. These questionnaires were completed before treatment, one month after treatment, and at 1-, 3- and 5-years post-treatment. Treatment involved full mouth reconstruction with composite resin restorations. The data was analysed as repeated measures by using a linear mixed-effects model. Results One hundred and twenty-three tooth wear patients that received restorative rehabilitation were included (97 males, 26 females, 37.5 ± 8.8 years-old). Data showed a statistically significant increase in both experienced OHRQoL and orofacial appearance after restorative treatment. The OHIP-scores remained stable over time, while the OES-scores slightly decreased during the years after treatment. Regarding the seven domains of the OHIP, the largest difference in OHIP-score was found in the domain of ‘Psychological Discomfort’. The mean overall OHIP-score was 1.8 at baseline and 1.3 at the 5-years recall. The mean OES score increased from 41.8 at baseline to 66.1 at the 5-years follow-up. Conclusions Tooth wear patients reported significant improvements in their OHRQoL and their perception of orofacial aesthetics after restorative treatment. This increase remained at least five years post-treatment. Clinical Significance The clinical impact of restorative treatment for tooth wear patients is considerable. This paper emphasizes the need to include a discussion of the patient related outcome measures when planning care.","","Oral health related quality of life, Aesthetics, Perception, Tooth wear, Restorative treatment, OHIP, OES","",""

Methods Dental composites were prepared with varying amounts of polishing and incubated in a CDC bioreactor with an approximate shear of 0.4 Pa. S. mutans biofilms developed in the bioreactors fed sucrose or glucose and at 10-h or 40-h HRT for one week. Biofilms were characterized by confocal laser microscopy (CLM). Composite surface roughness was characterized by optical profilometry, and pre- and post-incubation composite surface fine structure and elemental composition were determined using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Results Polishing had a significant impact on surface roughness, varying by a factor of 15 between the polished samples and the unpolished control. S. mutans biofilms grew statistically significantly thicker on the unpolished composites. Biofilm thickness was greater at shorter 10-h HRT compared to 40-h HRT. In most cases, biofilm thickness was not statistically significantly greater in sucrose-fed bioreactors than in glucose-fed bioreactors. SEM-EDS analysis did not identify any significant change in elemental composition after aging. Conclusions Accurate characterization of oral cavity biofilms must consider shear forces and the use of techniques that minimize alteration of the biofilm structure. Under shear, surface smoothness is the most important factor determining S. mutans biofilm thickness followed by HRT, while sucrose presence did not result in significantly greater biofilm thickness. Clinical Significance The obvious patterns of S. mutans growth along sub-micron scale grooving created by the polishing process suggested that initial biofilm attachment occurred in the shear-protected grooves. These results suggest that fine polishing may help prevent the initial formation of S. mutans biofilms compared to unpolished/coarse polished composites.","","Dental composite, Surface roughness, Streptococcus mutans, Biofilm, Sucrose, Glucose","",""

The presence of POS was not significantly affected by the restorative material after 24 h, 1 week and 1 month (p>0.05). After 1 week, the participants in the Surefil one™ group reported significantly less intensity of POS than the participants in the Filtek™ Bulk-Fill group (p = 0.02). Conclusions The use of Surefil one™ self-adhesive resin composite did not significantly increase the presence of POS compared to the use of the conventional bulk-fill resin composite. However, the intensity of POS was significantly less in the Surefil one ™ group after one week. Clinical significance The use of a self-adhesive bulk-fill resin composite in posterior restorations did not increase the presence of POS more than the use of a conventional bulk-fill resin composite. However, it decreased the intensity of POS after one week.

Clinical evaluation was applied using the USPHS criteria, and the presence of Charlie or Delta scores at the marginal integrity were considered as a failure. Results The overall survival rate of restorations was 68% after 36 months, 81% for TCR and 57% for SCR (p = 0.004). The multivariable Cox Regression model demonstrated that restorations performed after SCR had 3.44 times greater probability of failure compared to TCR (p = 0.006). The other two predictors for failure of restorations were teeth with Class II cavities (hazard ratio = 3.3) and children with gingival bleeding over 20% (hazard ratio = 2.5). Conclusions Performing composite restorations after SCR in primary teeth had success rate significantly lower than restorations performed after TCR. Complex cavities and worst patient´s oral hygiene were found to be predictors of failure of restorations. Clinical significance Although SCR has been demonstrating high rates of pulp preservation, clinicians should consider that composite restorations fail in a higher frequency compared to TCR in primary teeth and, in some circumstances, may be preferable in terms of restoration longevity.","","Dental caries, Selective caries removal, Composite resin, Primary teeth, Longevity","",""

Sixty-four teeth with natural carious lesions including caries-affected dentine (CAD) were selected. All substrates were prepared, conditioned and restored with pRMGIC (30% ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate (EGMP, experimental), Fuji II LC (control), Fuji IX, and Filtek™ Supreme with Scotchbond ™ Universal Adhesive. Shear bond strength (SBS) was determined after 24 h and three months storage in SBF at 37 °C. The debonded surfaces were examined using stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), Bonferroni post hoc tests (alpha=0.05) and independent T-tests were used for multifactorial data analysis. Results The hydrophilicity and functionality of EGMP enhanced the bond strength of the pRMGIC to different substrates after 24 h and 3 months as compared to F2LC (p<0.05). Adhesive failures were found to decrease with pRMGIC and integration into exposed enamel prisms and dentine tubules was observed with SEM.

Methods 38 patients (6 females, 32 males; 35.2 ± 7.6y) from the Radboud Tooth Wear Project with generalized moderate to severe tooth wear were treated with direct composite restorations on all teeth. Ethical approval was sought and granted before the study was undertaken. Intraoral 3D scans were recorded at 1 month (baseline) and 5 years (recall) after treatment. The amount of height loss was measured at six index teeth (first molars and upper central incisors). Patient factors (age, vertical dimension of occlusion increase, bite force, aetiology score, jaw position and bearing/ non-bearing cusps) were included in the analysis. Multilevel multiple regression with bootstrapping was used to analyse the influence of these factors on wear behaviour of restorations.

There was no significant change in the fracture load of any CAD/CAM crowns after TCML (p>0.05). CS exhibited a significantly higher volume wear than the other materials investigated. The wear tracts of all TCML crowns acted as failure origins during the fracture test. Conclusions The fracture resistance of glass-ceramic CAD/CAM crowns was significantly higher than that of resin composite crowns. A 5-year TCML aging did not affect the fracture resistance of CAD/CAM crowns investigated. However, TCML treatment produces a larger wear track in CS than in other materials.

Methods Reciprocating wear tests were performed on bonded interface samples involving commercial resin composite (Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill), resin cement (Rely X U200) and tooth enamel using the ball-on-flat configuration. The bonded samples were subjected up to 5 × 104 cycles of sliding contact, and the wear depth and wear track morphology were characterized after increments using white light interferometry and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Optical microscopy was also used to evaluate cracks and their propagation in the samples. Results In the early stages of sliding contact, wear evolved most rapidly at the interface, followed by the enamel and the resin composite. Gradually, the difference between the wear depth at the interface and other areas decreased. Furthermore, cracks and brittle fracture appeared in the enamel during the early stages of wear, adjacent to the interface. With continuing cyclic loading, enamel wear manifested primarily as ploughs, with discontinuous pits and peeled material. Cracking decreased to only a few cracks extending to the inner enamel and parallel to the interface. Conclusions Cracking and damage occurred in the enamel during the early stages of sliding contact and accelerated by poor margin finishing. Cracks caused by wear under sliding contact could be one of the reasons for secondary caries and tooth discoloration.","","Bonded interface, Damage mode, Enamel, Resin composite, Wear","",""

All respondent schools taught the use of posterior composites for occlusal and occluso-proximal cavities in premolars and molars. The mean percentage of preclinical teaching devoted to composites was greater than for amalgam (39% vs 29%). This proportion was anticipated to be 3:1 for posterior composite/amalgam in five years’ time. Most posterior restorations placed by students are composites (average 64%, ranging from 10 to 100%), with amalgam representing 19.5% of the restorations placed (ranging from 0%–50%). Slot-type cavities were the preparation techniques most commonly taught (80%) and most schools (67%) teach the mandatory use of rubber dam for moisture control.

The DOC was measured using a 6-mm diameter metal mold and a solvent dissolution method to remove the uncured RBC. The length of the remaining RBC was divided by 2. The exposure times were: 1 s and 3 s for M, 10 s and 20 s for V, and 10 s and 20 s for S.

Results Significant differences were found in the DOC achieved by the different LCUs and composites. The laser LCU emitted the highest power, radiant emittance is used above and in the tables and delivered the highest irradiance. However, this LCU used for 1 s delivered the lowest RE and produced the shortest DOC in all ten RBCs. The ANN demonstrated that the RE is the most critical factor for the DOC.

Two PCCs were luted with a conventional resin cement (RelyX Ultimate) combined with a universal adhesive (Scotchbond Universal) without (SB-E) or with (SB+E) selective enamel etching. The third PCC was luted with a self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX Unicem 2; RXU). Chi-square tests (α≤0.05) were applied. Based on clinical failures (complete debonding or need for replacement of the restorations), Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Results 31 patients were evaluated clinically using FDI criteria at 39 months. Clinically acceptable results were detected over time, except for “fracture of material and retention” (inacceptable fractures and debondings). Within materials, statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.003) between baseline and 39 months were found for “marginal adaptation” and “marginal staining”. At 39-month, SB+E and SB-E showed significantly better results compared to RXU in “marginal adaptation”(p ≤ 0.021) and “marginal staining”(p ≤ 0.013). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed higher survival rates after 39 months for SB+E (96%) and SB-E (88%) compared to RXU (69%) with statistically significant differences between RXU vs. SB-E (p = 0.022) and RXU vs. SB+E (p ≤ 0.001). Conclusions After 39-months, PCCs luted with the self-adhesive resin cement exhibited a statistically significant inferior survival rate compared to restorations luted with the conventional resin cement combined with a universal adhesive without or with selective enamel etching. Clinical significance Currently, self-adhesive resin cements cannot be recommended for luting partial ceramic crowns. However, the standard adhesive luting procedure comprising a universal adhesive and luting composite yielded good clinical results for more than 3 years irrespectively of application of a selective enamel etching step.","","Partial ceramic crowns, Self-adhesive resin cements, Universal adhesive, CAD/CAM, Clinical study, Selective enamel etching","",""

Methods A convenience sample of 34 patients were recruited to a prospective trial between December 2010 and June 2013. The participants were provided 1269 full-mouth direct resin composite restorations (Clearfil AP-X) by 5 experienced operators, using the DSO-technique. Treatment resulted in an increase in the vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO). Failure was assessed at three levels. Frequencies of failure were analysed using Kaplan Meier survival curves and the effects of the relevant variables calculated with a multifactorial Cox regression (p < 0.05). Results Annual failure rates (for all levels of failure, ‘Level 3- ‘) of ≤ 2.2% and ≤ 2.9% were respectively reported for the anterior and posterior restorations with a mean observation time of 62.4 months. The completion of an anterior restoration with the need for further appointments resulted in significantly more Level 2- & 3- failures. An evaluation of the performance of the premolar and posterior maxillary restorations showed significantly lowered risks of certain types of failures, compared to the molar and posterior mandibular restorations. Conclusions At 5.5 years, 2.3% of the overall restorations displayed catastrophic, (Level 1) failures. Molar restorations, posterior mandibular restorations and the anterior restorations requiring two further sessions for completion, were associated with significantly higher risks for failure. Clinical significance Direct resin composite can offer an acceptable medium-term option for the treatment of severe, generalized tooth wear; molar restorations may require higher maintenance.","","Severe tooth wear, Restorative treatment, Tooth wear, Composite resin restorations, Survival, Clinical study, Interventions, Increase vertical dimension of occlusion","",""

Data The literature search was conducted based on the question: “Is the use of compomers as a dental filling material more successful in the restorative treatment of decayed primary teeth than other dental filling materials?” No language restriction was applied and systematic reviews published up to May 2023 were included. The ROBIS tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews. Data were extracted for narrative synthesis, considering the restoration failure/success outcomes. Search Online search was conducted in three databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane library). Study selection The electronic search yielded a total of 779 publications. Finally, 18 systematic reviews were included in this umbrella review. Four systematic reviews presented a low risk of bias, 11 presented an unclear risk of bias and three presented a high risk of bias. Most systematic reviews presenting low risk of bias reported no difference in the success rates of compomers compared to other dental filling materials used for restoration of decayed primary teeth. Studies that found a significant difference or that made clear recommendations towards the use of compomers were commonly rated with a high risk of bias. Conclusion Compomers are similar to other dental filling materials for the placement of direct restorations in primary teeth. Clinical significance The results of this umbrella review indicate a similar clinical performance of compomers compared to other materials containing a resin component for direct restoration in primary teeth. Therefore, the choice of restorative material will depend on multiple factors, such as clinician's skills/preferences, patients’ wishes, costs, and cavity type/location.","","Compomer, Primary teeth, Overview, Systematic review, Umbrella review","",""

Methods All live-born children in Pelotas, in 2004, were prospectively investigated and a representative sample was assessed for oral conditions at ages 5 and 12. The outcome was the quality of the restoration (satisfactory/unsatisfactory). Independent variables included socioeconomic, behavioral and oral health characteristics at the individual level and the size of cavity and material at the tooth level. Associations were tested using multilevel logistic regression models. Results A total of 1,000 participants and 249 restorations in the permanent dentition were examined. Most of the restorations were composites (73.5%), while only 6.8% were amalgam. After adjusted analyses, children whose parents received information on how to prevent their child from developing caries before reaching 5 years of age had 91.0% less chance of having an unsatisfactory restoration compared to children whose parents never received information (OR = 0.09; 95% CI 0.01–0.59). Also, the chances of presenting unsatisfactory restorations were 5.3 higher in children at high-risk for untreated dental caries in the permanent dentition, in comparison with children at low risk (OR = 5.32; 95% CI 1.07–26.6). Conclusions Low-risk for untreated dental caries and having received information on preventing dental caries, reduced the chance of presenting failed restorations, showing that factors related to individuals play an important role in the quality of restorations. Clinical significance Our findings highlight the role that individual-related factors play in restoration longevity in children, reinforcing the need for a patient-centered approach in restorative dentistry.","","Dental restorations, Dental restoration failure, Cohort studies, Child, Posterior teeth, Longevity","",""

Methods Four novel bulk-fill composite with different composition were used; Sonic Fill-2 (KSF), Filtek BulkFill (FBF), Admira Fusion X-tra (AFX), Beautifil Bulk Restorative (SBB) and a control group (glass) were included in the study. After standardized surface polishing procedure, surface properties of composite specimens were evaluated using surface roughness (SR) measurements by a profilometer, hydrophobicity and surface free energy (SFE) analyses, elemental and topographic analyses by SEM-EDS. To evaluate the bacterial adhesion, composite specimens were immersed in artificial saliva and mucin for pellicle development. After 1-h immersion, bacterial suspension was added to the pellicle-coated specimens, which were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. Adhered bacteria counts were determined as x108 Cfu/ml. Bacterial adhesion was also investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results No statistically significant differences were found among bulk fill composites in terms of surface roughness while glass showed the lowest Ra values. The lowest contact angle values were found in the control group and Sonic Fill-2 while the highest SFE values were observed in these materials. No statistically significant differences were found between the S. mutans counts. For S. Mitis adhesion, the highest value was found in Sonic Fill-2 and no significant differences were observed between the other groups. Conclusions SR of bulk-fill composite resins had no effect on bacterial adhesion. However, bacterial adhesion increased with higher SFE values. Clinical significance Although the surface roughness of composites used in the study is similar, in clinically, S. mitis adhesion may be more in the KSF group because of high surface free energy.","","Bulk-fill, Surface roughness, Bacterial adhesion, Hydrophobicity, Surface free energy, CLSM","",""

Both materials were applied with or without their respective resinous coating, and were compared with a conventional GIC (Ketac Fil) and a hybrid composite resin (CR; G-ænial Posterior). Methods 78 standardized occlusal Class I cavities were restored with the various materials (n = 13 per group). Before and after chewing simulation (30,000 cycles at 40 N), each sample underwent optical scanning procedures (Omnicam). A comparison of the total wear using a fluorescence-aided identification technique (OraCheck) followed, and differences (α = 5%) between groups were compared by means of MANOVA. Results Regarding the wear rates of hvGIC and ghRS, no differences could be observed (p > .050), and this was not affected by the resinous coating. All hvGIC and ghRS restorations showed significantly higher abrasive wear than CR (p < .001), while the conventional GIC displayed a significant underperformance compared with any other material (p < .001). Conclusions Resinous coating of hvGIC or ghRS does not appear to exert an effective long-term protection against advanced abrasive wear. Compared to the conventional GIC showing a considerable substance loss, both hvGIC and ghRS materials revealed an improved abrasion resistance, but clearly failed to meet the excellent values of the CR. Clinical Significance Occlusal loading should be carefully considered when using hvGIC or ghRS as amalgam (or composite resin) alternatives for the restoration of posterior teeth.","","Abrasion, Chewing simulation, Equia, Glass hybrid restorative system, Glass ionomer cement, High-viscosity glass ionomer cement, OraCheck, Resinous coating, Wear","",""
