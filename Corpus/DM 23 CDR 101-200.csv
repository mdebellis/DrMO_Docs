In recent years, enhanced weathering (EW) has drawn considerable attention as a potential carbon dioxide removal technology (CRD). The advantages of EW are not only to capture CO2 but also to improve the productivity of agricultural land and intensify soil water retention. Here, a comprehensive literature review is conducted for informing a cradle-to-grave life cycle impact assessment of EW of wollastonite. While previous studies report that the transportation process has the greatest environmental and human health impacts where natural rocks are used, there is currently a gap in the literature with respect to the implications of synthesized rocks. The aim of this work is to analyze and compare the environmental, human health, and CO2 payback period performances of EW for carbon capture using synthetic and natural wollastonite. The functional unit is 1 kg CO2 removed. The results indicate that the natural scenario performs better from environmental, human health, and CO2 payback perspectives when compared to the synthetic scenario.","Enhanced weathering, Carbon capture, Life cycle assessment, Synthesized and nature wollastonite, Carbon dioxide payback period"

With their worldwide distribution and abundance, gas hydrates have vast potential to become the next pillar of the energy industry. Although no entity has established methane extraction from hydrates at a commercial scale yet, extensive laboratory experiments have introduced several extraction strategies. Methods such as depressurization, thermal stimulation, and inhibitor injection are likely to disturb seabed integrity, which may result in catastrophic consequences. However, the CO2 replacement method is inferred to be preserving the seabed stability, offering an opportunity to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions safely. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the progress of experimental work in developing methane-extraction methods for gas hydrate reservoirs. Depressurization combined with thermal stimulation can be proposed as a viable methane extraction method based on laboratory-scale experiments, however, a sustainable extraction method is yet to be developed to field-scale when both economic and environmental perspectives are considered. A handful of field production runs have delivered positive outcomes to establish the exploitability of natural hydrate reservoirs, but thorough investigations and scientific collaborations are needed to develop hydrate accumulations as a commercially viable energy source.","Unconventional resources, Natural gas hydrates, Methane, Dissociation methods, CO replacement"

Recent progress of the decarbonization in the ocean and the underlying subsurface sedimentary basin is reviewed in this study. Considerable research effort has gone into the decarbonization of cargo ships and offshore oil and gas platforms, which mainly includes two aspects: 1) replace and integrate the current fuel with clean energy, and 2) deploy the carbon capture technology. Many technologies have been demonstrated to be effective in decarbonization with some being commercialized recently. Wind turbines have been linked with emerging battery technologies to provide power to offshore projects, while other renewable energies such as wave, solar and tidal energies are in the research stage. Comparison of different CO2 storage technologies shows that CO2 storage in the offshore saline aquifers/reservoirs is more achievable from the perspectives of cost and environmental concerns. The offshore CCUS projects under operation and planning until 2022 have been summarized, most of which are planned by companies in Europe near the North Sea. Nevertheless, ocean-based negative emission technologies (NET) are still in the early stage.

I suggest that apart from performing a socio-economic function, the bridge has been invested with significant symbolic power, and provides material routes and forms for the construction of a unified national geohistorical consciousness. I argue that the Crimean bridge has become a “focal object” for Russian cultural biopolitics, providing a space for the state-sponsored performances of power that have come to define both the Russian political agenda and efforts to reconnect Crimea historically to Russia. Indeed, the bridge has not only connected the banks of the Kerch Strait between Crimea and the Russian mainland but has also connected different and often competing narratives of Russian history.","Infrastructure, Sovereignty, Performance, History, Biopolitics, Crimea"

However, a consensus on whether TCS favors a healthy peri-implant environment is limited. Purpose The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials was to determine the effects of TCS-containing toothpaste on dental implant health based on clinical, immunological, and microbiological parameters, as well as on reported adverse events. Material and methods Clinical studies comparing peri-implant conditions in participants by using TCS toothpaste versus conventional fluoride toothpaste (control) were extracted from 9 databases. The studies were assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized clinical trials (RoB 2). Datasets for bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), osteo-immunoinflammatory mediators, and bacterial load were plotted, and the standard mean difference (SMD) quantitative analysis was applied by using the Rev Man 5.3 software program. Adverse effects reported by the studies were also tabulated. The certainty of evidence was assessed by using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach. Results Six studies were included in the meta-analyses. BOP was higher in the control group than in the TCS toothpaste group at 3 months (SMD −0.59 [−1.11, −.07] P=.002, I2=77%) and 6 months (SMD −0.59 [−0.83, −0.34] P=.009, I2=79%). PD (SMD −0.04 [−0.08, −0.00] P=.04, I2=0%) was also deeper in the control group versus TCS toothpaste at 6 months (SMD −0.41 [−0.73, −0.10] P=.04, I2=77%). CAL, GI, and PI did not differ between groups (P>.05). Among the osteo-immunoinflammatory mediators, IL-10 levels increased, and IL-1β and osteoprotegerin levels decreased in the TCS toothpaste group (P<.05). Microbiological findings found that TCS toothpaste prevented the growth of periodontal pathogens, specifically in up to approximately 20% of the Prevotella intermedia. Adverse effects were not reported after toothbrushing in either group. However, most studies had “some” or “high” risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence was considered to be “very low.” Conclusions Most studies were short-term (3 and 6 months) analyses, and the results found that, although TCS-containing toothpaste had positive osteo-immunoinflammatory and microbiologic results, clinical parameters, including CAL, GI, and PI, were not influenced.",

These measures can include physical, chemical, and biological technologies such as impermeable and permeable barriers, stabilization and solidification, and phytostabilization. Contaminant containment is advantageous because it can stop contaminant plumes from migrating further and allow for pollutant reduction at sites where the source is inaccessible or cannot be removed. Moreover, unlike other options, contaminant containment measures do not require the excavation of contaminated substrates. However, contaminant containment measures require regular inspections to monitor for contaminant mobilization and migration. This review critically evaluates the sources of persistent contaminants, the different approaches to contaminant remediation, and the various physical-chemical-biological processes of contaminant containment. Additionally, the review provides case studies of contaminant containment operations under real or simulated field conditions. In summary, contaminant containment measures are essential for preventing further contamination and reducing risks to public health and the environment. While periodic monitoring is necessary, the benefits of contaminant containment make it a valuable remediation option when other methods are not feasible.","Contaminants, Containment, Permeable reactive barriers, Stabilization and solidification, Phytostabilization"

MACC associated with biomedical alloys used as orthopedic implants, screws, and dental implants has been the subject of most recent research regarding this corrosion mechanism. However, there are also many engineering structures where the pre-requisite conditions for MACC are met but have to date received less scientific scrutiny.

Based on integrated analysis of international experience from the world's major developed countries, in-depth knowledge of the current and future technologies, and China's energy and ecological resources potential, five lessons for the implementation of China's carbon neutrality are proposed: (1) transformation of energy production pattern from a coal-dominated pattern to a diversified renewable energy pattern; (2) renewable power-to-X and large-scale underground energy storage; (3) integration of green hydrogen production, storage, transport and utilization; (4) construction of clean energy systems based on smart sector coupling (ENSYSCO); (5) improvement of ecosystem carbon sinks both in nationwide forest land and potential desert in Northwest China.

Human exploitation of natural resources is leading to an immense rise in the concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG), i.e., primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This boosted quantity of CO2 by human intervention leads to increased global temperatures and climate change. Hence there is a crucial need for fixing CO2 to control global climate change and meet the pledges of the Paris Agreement. The global CO2 emission hit an all-time high in 2018, emitting 32.7 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, whereas the current scenario for global CO2 utilization constitutes a tiny amount, i.e., 0.2 billion tons/year. Hence various CO2 utilization techniques, such as CO2 deployment in reforming techniques and its direct conversion into fuels, have been emphasized. Finally, the CO2 storage methods have been underlined, and the recent advancements along with the outlook in DAC technique have been discussed at the end. The DAC technique shows the most promise for future CO2 capture and utilization, pending resolution of initial investment and techno-economic feasibility challenges.

To overcome these drawbacks, nanocurcumin (nCur) formulations have been developed for improved biomaterial delivery and enhanced treatment outcomes. This novel biomaterial holds tremendous promise for the treatment of various oral diseases, the majority of which are caused by dental biofilm. These include dental caries, periodontal disease, root canal infection and peri-implant diseases, as well as other non-biofilm mediated oral diseases such as oral cancer and oral lichen planus. A number of in-vitro studies have demonstrated the antibacterial efficacy of nCur in various formulations against common oral pathogens such as S. mutans, P. gingivalis and E. faecalis, which are strongly associated with dental caries, periodontitis and root canal infection, respectively. In addition, some clinical studies were suggestive of the notion that nCur can indeed enhance the clinical outcomes of oral diseases such as periodontitis and oral lichen planus, but the level of evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the methodological limitations of the available studies. The versatility of nCur to treat a diverse range of oral diseases augurs well for its future in dentistry, as reflected by rapid pace in which studies pertaining to this topic are published in the scientific literature. In order to keep abreast of the latest development of nCur in dentistry, this narrative review was undertaken.

There are numerous opportunities to incorporate carbon removal and management within the bioeconomy, but the majority of immediate carbon removal potential exists in four bioproducts: bioenergy, bioplastics, biochar, and wood products. We analyze the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and disposition of sequestered carbon over 10 000 years for four bioproducts representative of each broader category: an advanced BECCS pathway, biopolyethylene, oriented strand board, and biochar soil amendment. We find that the BECCS pathway has the greatest magnitude and durability of CO2 storage over all time horizons. However, non-BECCS pathways achieve 34–64% of the drawdown magnitude relative to BECCS and retain 55–67% of their initial drawdown over 100 years (central estimate). We identify three engineering strategies for enhancing carbon drawdown: reducing biomass supply chain emissions, maximizing carbon stored in long-lived products, and extending the term of carbon storage. Finally, we highlight the need to characterize both the magnitude and permanence of carbon drawdown as a means for policymakers and technology developers to deploy limited biomass resources to maximize mitigation benefits.",

Additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) has broken down major barriers in the way of producing complex 3D geometries. Electron beam melting (EBM) is one such 3D printing process applicable to metals and alloys. EBM offers build rates up to two orders of magnitude greater than comparable laser-based technologies and a high vacuum environment to prevent accumulation of trace elements. These features make EBM particularly advantageous for materials susceptible to spontaneous oxidation and nitrogen pick-up when exposed to air (e.g., titanium and titanium-based alloys). For skeletal reconstruction(s), anatomical mimickry and integrated macro-porous architecture to facilitate bone ingrowth are undoubtedly the key features of EBM manufactured implants. Using finite element modelling of physiological loading conditions, the design of a prosthesis may be further personalised. This review looks at the many unique clinical applications of EBM in skeletal repair and the ground-breaking innovations in prosthetic rehabilitation. From a simple acetabular cup to the fifth toe, from the hand-wrist complex to the shoulder, and from vertebral replacement to cranio-maxillofacial reconstruction, EBM has experienced it all. While sternocostal reconstructions might be rare, the repair of long bones using EBM manufactured implants is becoming exceedingly frequent. Despite the various merits, several challenges remain yet untackled. Nevertheless, with the capability to produce osseointegrating implants of any conceivable shape/size, and permissive of bone ingrowth and functional loading, EBM can pave the way for numerous fascinating and novel applications in skeletal repair, regeneration, and rehabilitation. Statement of significance Electron beam melting (EBM) offers unparalleled possibilities in producing contaminant-free, complex and intricate geometries from alloys of biomedical interest, including Ti6Al4V and CoCr. We review the diverse range of clinical applications of EBM in skeletal repair, both as mass produced off-the-shelf implants and personalised, patient-specific prostheses. From replacing large volumes of disease-affected bone to complex, multi-material reconstructions, almost every part of the human skeleton has been replaced with an EBM manufactured analog to achieve macroscopic anatomical-mimickry. However, various questions regarding long-term performance of patient-specific implants remain unaddressed. Directions for further development include designing personalised implants and prostheses based on simulated loading conditions and accounting for trabecular bone microstructure with respect to physiological factors such as patient's age and disease status.","Electron beam melting, Additive manufacturing, Human, Bone, Implant, Biomaterials"

The main working principle of a PRB is to treat a variety of contaminants downstream from the contaminated source zone (“hot spot”). However, to accurately assess the longevity of PRBs, it is essential to know the total contaminant mass in the source area and its approximate geometry. PRBs are regarded as both a safeguarding and an advanced decontamination technique, depending on the contamination scenario and its outcome during the operational lifetime of the barrier. In the last three decades, many PRBs have performed very well, that is, met expected clean-up goals at a variety of contaminated sites.

This method involves injecting CO2 into existing hydrocarbon reservoirs to increase oil recovery. CO2-EOR has been used as a tertiary oil recovery technique for many years, and it has proven to be effective in enhancing oil recovery while reducing greenhouse gas emissions since the reservoir could serve as permanent storage site for CO2 sequestration. The composition of CO2 allows it to dissolve in crude oil, reducing its viscosity and promoting hydrocarbon flow. However, when CO2 is injected into the reservoirs, it can react with the rock minerals and water, leading to the alteration of petrophysical properties of the hydrocarbon reservoirs. The precipitation of certain minerals can lead to pore blockage in the reservoir formation, which could reduce the performance of the CO2-EOR injection process and the integrity of the reservoir for storage. The complex nature of the tight pore throat of hydrocarbon reservoirs indicates that the pore structure could vary significantly in size from the microscale to the nanoscale, affecting the properties of the reservoir and oil-displacement efficiency. The magnitude of the rock property alteration during CO2 injection has been reported to vary depending on the rock type and injection strategies adopted. Thus, to evaluate the effects of CO2 injection in rocks, laboratory experiments are being used to analyse the processes using core samples, while numerical simulation approaches have also been employed to model the processes of fluid migration from the reservoir to the caprock layer. The dynamics of fault opening and mechanical failure in rocks have also been addressed using coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes modelled on different scales. Overall, CO2-EOR and carbon sequestration is an important technique for enhancing oil recovery and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Numerous efforts are underway, such as CCS (e.g., biochar used for soil amendment; captured carbon injected into onshore or offshore reservoirs) and CCU (captured CO2 used for crop/algae production), due to enormous societal, economic and environmental concerns on climate change and for complying with emission regulations as well as meeting the committed emission reduction targets. This study compiled information on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction initiatives, including CCS and CCU on the earth, recent technological advances in CCS and CCU, and their economic, environmental and societal implications. The prospect of CCS and CCU technologies has also been discussed. CCS processes require less energy compared with CCU and thus tend to be more cost-effective than CCU. The global warming potential (GWP) and the cost of energy systems that deployed CCS/CCU varied from 0.007–0.225 kg CO2 eq per MJ and $0.017–0.070 MJ−1, respectively. Both CCS and CCU have challenges, and public perception of these initiatives seems to be complex or not satisfactory for deploying large-scale projects, which hinders meeting the GHG emission reduction targets of different jurisdictions. The acceptance of CCU seems to be higher compared to that of CCS because of the concerns about land-use complexities. For a carbon-neutral economy, a single transition pathway appears to be inadequate. Stringent policies, financial incentives/benefits, stakeholder participation and technological advances would be crucial for the transition; however, technological advances and policy initiatives must be justified by a broader sustainability check to avoid the risk of investment and climate change.",

This promising technique focuses on eliminating heavy metal pollutants and hazardous aromatic compounds by physisorption, chemisorption, precipitation, denitrification, and/or biodegradation. Researchers have utilized ZVI, activated carbon, natural and manufactured zeolites, and other by-products as reactive media barriers.

The South-West coast of Sri Lanka has recently been the target of a number of anthropogenic operations, such as off-shore sand mining, mega sand nourishments, and land reclamations, as a result of the country's explosive growth. The impacts of these coastal development activities and existing measures on the prevailing coastal environment are poorly known. A thorough review of current management practices is required in order to assess the physical and ecological sustainability of these measures, which are being driven by recent efforts to preserve the coastal environment and research findings on the environmental impact of erosion mitigation strategies. In this study, openly-available journal articles, impact assessments reports and guidelines, websites, press releases, unpublished data and information about coastal erosion management measures have been reviewed. In addition, the sustainability of different strategies applied, opportunities and challenges of existing measures have been discussed. Moreover, this review provides information required on the subject of coastal erosion amongst stakeholders which will help to implement mitigation measures and implementation of current and future coastal defenses.","IORA, Beach nourishment, Coastal zone, Offshore dredging, Mitigation"

A top-down approach for post-disaster reconstruction, usually relying on external resources and standardized prototypes, might strongly hinder the recovery process. To enhance community resilience, the use of traditional knowledge in post-disaster reconstruction is highlighted in the Sendai Framework. This study specifically focuses on traditional construction. A systematic literature review is conducted on post-earthquake housing recovery with traditional construction, and a hierarchical analysis framework helps categorize the review results at strategic, managerial, and operational levels. Drawn from the review, a classification of traditional construction systems is proposed, corresponding to their varied seismic performance. The results indicate the possibility of strengthening traditional construction with seismic engineering and its successful implementation into reconstruction. Specifically, it includes timber-reinforced masonry, wattle and daub, timber frame construction, reinforced rammed earth, and reinforced adobe. However, we also find that the sustainable practice of traditional construction remains problematic, and the replication of participatory reconstruction is difficult. This preliminary review serves to bridge the discipline of vernacular architecture and disaster management and establish a solid common ground for further argumentation.","Local seismic culture, Vernacular architecture, Community-based disaster risk management, Owner-driven reconstruction, People-centered reconstruction, Housing assistance, Earthquake"

Therefore, the research on the scour protection mechanisms and countermeasures for various cross-sea bridge foundation were reviewed. The novel scour protection mechanisms were analyzed and proposed, including scour resistance enhancement, approaching current direction and velocity change, bottom stagnant flow and sediment retention, and the diminution of down flow, horseshoe vortex, and wake vortex. In this study, the pros and cons of construction cost, eco-friendly and interactional efficiency were assessed comprehensively; the highlight property of these countermeasures consisted of economy, availability, and stability; hybrid scour countermeasures were critically selected from the research on riprap, sacrificial piles, three perpendicular poles, and ring-wing pier, which offered the strongest scour resistance; the development of these scour countermeasures was recorded with the aim to provide advanced and developed reference of the valuable research in this field.

This study reviews the current status of mangrove ecology, management and conservation in Sri Lanka. In 2015, Sri Lanka became the first nation to legally protect all its mangrove forests; hence mangrove management in Sri Lanka may act as an important exemplar for other nations. Mangroves are found sporadically in the coastal area of Sri Lanka, including as a few dense mangrove forests. Mangrove vegetation provides a cost-effective ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction capability in Sri Lanka, particularly in the areas with poor living standards. Mangroves are used for timber, fishing materials, medicine and food in the country. Despite the environmental and socioeconomic importance of mangroves, several threats, including the expansion of aquaculture and agriculture, urbanization, pollution, climate change and sea level rise, exist in Sri Lanka. Many mangrove reforestation and afforestation initiatives in Sri Lanka have not succeeded, often because of the lack of sufficient monitoring of seedlings after the reforestation campaign and poor selection of planting sites without proper assessment of environmental conditions. In order to protect mangrove forests in Sri Lanka, some immediate measures need to be implemented. Proper planting of seedlings, community-based mangrove reforestation, sustainable aquaculture practices and proper legal enforcement are some of the important steps for the conservation of this highly productive ecosystem in the country.","Biodiversity conservation, Coastal area protection, Coastal bioshield, Mangrove rehabilitation, Mangroves in Sri Lanka"

Since implants are objects implanted in the body as a piece of tissue or a prosthetic device, the existence of planktonic bacteria on their surface can increase the risks induced by infections and the formation of biofilm. Infections can cause severe pain and even death in some cases. Despite developments in the medical field, the risk of infection after orthopedic surgery is estimated at 2–5%, emphasizing the importance of this subject. Biofilm infections destroy adjacent tissues and eject the implant. On the other hand, the formation of biofilm prevents antibiotic delivery to the objective organ, so infections are difficult to treat. The conventional drug treatment system has many limitations, such as overdose, the need for hospitalization, toxicity, low efficacy, and poor biological distribution. So, topical delivery has been a promising solution to overcome these limitations. Here, a compilation of approaches was attempted to improve implants, in particular dental implants, to combat infections. According to the results reported in the literature, using antibiotic-loaded implants, metallic and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), polymers, and antimicrobial peptides as a targeted drug-delivery system can be considered as solutions for decreasing these risks.","Implant, Surface modification, Nanostructures, Polymers, Antibiotic, Bioactive materials"

Regenerative endodontics aims to regenerate the damaged “pulp-like” tissue, which can preserve the teeth' vitality and sensitivity while avoiding necrosis. The main clinical benefit is root maturation. The “pulp-like” tissue does not refer to regenerated pulp tissue with an odontoblastic layer or the formation of pulp-dentin complexes. The cell homing technique is built on endogenous stem cells and their capacity to regenerate tissue. Cell homing refers to endogenous cells’ migration or infiltration into the cite when stimulated by physiochemical or biological stimuli or by passive flow with a blood clot from the apical tissue. Its Regenerative Endodontic Procedures success criteria are defined by the American Association of Endodontists. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of vital pulp tissue and various strategies to promote regeneration of damaged pulp tissue. The cell homing technique will be reviewed through clinical trials. Methods We performed a comprehensive literature review on a total of nine clinical trials of regenerative endodontics using the cell-homing technique based on three databases and duplicate manuscripts were removed. Results Regenerative endodontics using the cell-homing technique shows promising results that can be translated into clinical practice. However, a favorable result was observed in immature teeth, and the results are contradictory in mature teeth. Conclusion Regeneration therapy is an attractive new alternative to conventional endodontic treatments. Preservation of vitality and continuation of root development in damaged teeth would be a clear advantage.","Biomaterials, cell homing technique, growth factors, pulp tissues, regenerative endodontic, scaffolds, stem cells"

However, several negative environmental impacts are associated with the resulting brine, for which a range of treatment, recovery, and disposal technologies have been suggested in the academic literature. Despite this, the technological emphasis fails to explain the absence of sustainable practices in many countries or the roles and responsibilities of involved actors. There is also a lack of consistent conceptualizations that include regulatory and governance-related issues. In this review paper, we examined the brine management issue in desalination activities as a socio-technical issue that needs to be embedded more strongly within governance and regulatory frameworks. Case experiences and options related to command and control, economic regulation, market-based approaches and public support are discussed and linked with brine management practices. This review paper shows that baseline regulations such as standards, assessments, and thresholds are still emerging, but they need to be complemented by approaches focusing on desalination costs and environmental performance. Overall, cross-sectoral collaboration in designing local brine regulation options is important for solving the brine issue. There is a need to create a joint action arena between the desalination industry, the public sector, and actors involved in innovations related to brine management. Besides, public leadership, through providing incentives and investments, is highly valuable for sustainable brine management. This leadership should address the cost of brine treatment or the required infrastructural development.","Brine management, Desalination, Economic regulation, Environmental management, Water governance, Water reuse"

However, those strategies are associated with inevitable drawbacks, such as severe side effects, substantial local tumor recurrence, and difficult-to-treat bone defects after tumor resection. To overcome these shortcomings and achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes, advanced bifunctional biomaterials which simultaneously promote bone regeneration and combat bone tumor growth are increasingly advocated. These bifunctional bone substitute materials fill bone defects following bone tumor resection and subsequently exert local anticancer effects. Here we describe various types of the most prevalent bone tumors and provide an overview of common treatment options. Subsequently, we review current progress regarding the development of bifunctional bone substitute materials combining osteogenic and anticancer efficacy. To this end, we categorize these biomaterials based on their anticancer mechanism deriving from i) intrinsic biomaterial properties, ii) local drug release of anticancer agents, and iii) oxidative stress-inducing and iv) hyperthermia-inducing biomaterials. Consequently, this review offers researchers, surgeons and oncologists an up-to-date overview of our current knowledge on bone tumors, their treatment options, and design of advanced bifunctional biomaterials with strong potential for clinical application in oncological orthopedics.","Bone substitutes, Bone tumor, Bone tumor treatment, Residual tumor cells, Local anti-cancer efficacy, Bone regeneration and reconstruction"

Currently, the most feasible path is to recover P from incinerated sludge ash, rather than from the aqueous phase or sewage sludge via recycling. The differences in P recovery products also lead to differences in products; in addition to traditional use in agriculture, the products also have potential industry applications. Therefore, the differences in P recovery products significantly determine the sustainability of P recovery practices.

We identified several often reported challenges to attain sustainable food systems: reduced yields, increased land demand, nitrogen needs, changes in diet, food waste, distribution and access to food, and externalities to third countries. Finally, we discuss two main approaches to sustainable agriculture with potential complementarity to fulfil the objectives of sustainable agriculture as reflected in the different European policies and strategies. Sustainable intensification with focus on environmental- friendly production, and agroecology with focus on ecology, social justice and food sovereignty. We reflect on how both approaches can be integrated to create synergies and optimize delivery of multiple ecosystem services. The transformation to sustainable agriculture, as expected from the several revised strategies, is not just a technical question of farming practices, but requires a holistic approach considering social, economic, cultural, technical and environmental aspects. Local adaptations, stakeholder participation, and recognition that agriculture produces more than crops, are key to support this transition of agriculture and food systems. SIGNIFICANCE The transition towards more sustainable agriculture requires alignment of policies related to social, economic and environmental aspects, including social and economic acknowledgment to farmers, as managers of agroecosystems and cultural landscapes delivering a range of ecosystem services.","Green deal, Farm to fork strategy, Biodiversity strategy, Soil strategy, Long term vision for EU rural areas, Sustainable farming, Agroecology, Sustainable intensification"

However, during field-scale production trials, common formation damage problems such as sand migration and fluid invasion were identified. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend how the damage arises, how it can be quantified, and what tactics must be used to cope with the effects of the formation damages before commercial production. During production, hydrates dissociate releasing the trapped (methane) gas and yield large volumes of fresh water. The unconsolidated sediments that typically make up gas hydrate reservoirs can lose integrity when hydrate dissociates, and the sediment grains can readily mobilize and subsequently become trapped elsewhere in the porous medium. This entrapment can result in a loss of permeability as the fluid flow paths are blocked. Furthermore, the water released during hydrate dissociation may also freeze due to the low temperatures and the cooling effect from hydrate dissociation, which can further clog the pore space. The hydrate dissociation also changes the geomechanical properties of the formation and causes the sediments to collapse. Water and gas blockage can also occur due to the fluid invasion occurring during drilling and completion operations, and adverse chemical interactions can occur between the rock minerals and the released produced fresh water. Sand control is a relatively mature field in the oil and gas industry, but applying sand control principles to gas hydrate reservoirs remains a challenge and active area of research. Current areas of research in preventing formation damage during methane hydrate production include optimizing the production parameters particularly the solid–liquid velocity and depressurization rate, introducing nanoparticles to stabilize loose grains in the hydration layer, and using the correct additives in the drilling fluid to limit early hydrate dissociation.","Methane hydrates production, Formation damage, Fines migration"

In the review, from the technical perspective of civil engineering, based on the five characteristics of resilience, four aspects regarding the seismic resilience of shield tunnels were presented: failure mode and damage mechanism, seismic design method, prevention measures and post-earthquake repair of shield tunnels. First, the definition of seismic resilience of shield tunnel is introduced. Then the failure modes of the shield tunnel under the seismic action and mechanism of damage were summarised under two types: global and local. Consequently, based on the design, several seismic calculation methods were analysed. Next, the current understanding and exploration of shield tunnels in the construction and repair stages were described. Because of lack of relevant repair cases following earthquakes, this review provides a summary of the newly developed techniques and methods of the shield tunnel, which are used to improve seismic resilience during operation. Further, the limitation of the current research were summarised, followed by a short discussion on improving the resilience of shield tunnels in terms of seismic design, construction, operation, and post-earthquake repairs.

However, the use of synthetic HA is currently limited due to the unfavourable mechanical and morphological issues on cell infiltration and interaction. To overcome these obstacles, various strategies have been proposed, especially through a wide range of cationic and anionic doping. Among them, cationic doping seems to have a set of significant benefits over pure HA due to the significant microstructural modifications, and thus this strategy represents a major step forward in improving the inherent drawback of bioceramic implants, i.e., their poor mechanical properties. Accordingly, this review aims to highlight candidates with potential for further clinical development of the third-generation bioceramics through doping HA with s-, p-, d-, and f-blocks cations and to explore their potential applications in bone regeneration and void filling.

Over the last two decades, structural health monitoring (SHM) using different piezo sensor configurations have gained a lot of interest among researchers for monitoring concrete structures due to their non-destructive nature, real-time monitoring capabilities, early damage detection and potential for reducing downtime and costs. Among the different piezo configurations, embedded piezo sensor has gained significant attentions as it allows monitoring from the time concrete is poured. This paper provides a comprehensive review of embedded piezo sensor configuration for monitoring the different life stages of concrete structures. Based on their manufacturing, these sensors are initially classified into different clusters and their performance is evaluated for each SHM application covering various phases of concrete life cycle.

It contributes to the effectiveness of the therapy, promoting accelerated healing, supporting the reduction of bed rest and pain medications, improving patients’ quality of life, and reducing the risk to undergo surgery in patients affected by VCFs. Therefore, the aim of this review is to outline the fundamental concepts of multimodal treatment for VCF, as well as the present function and significance of biophysical stimulation in the treatment of VCF patients.","Vertebral compression fractures, Fragility fractures, Biophysical stimulation, Capacitive-coupling"

Methods A literature search was performed using SCOPUS, PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials according to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses statement. Inclusion criteria was limited to Level I-IV human studies reporting on indications, surgical techniques, imaging, and/or clinical outcomes of 2-stage revision ACLR. Results Thirteen studies with 355 patients treated with 2-stage revision ACLR were identified. The most commonly reported indications were tunnel malposition and tunnel widening, with knee instability being the most common symptomatic indication. Tunnel diameter threshold for 2-stage reconstruction ranged from 10 to 14 mm. The most common grafts used for primary ACLR were bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) autograft, hamstring graft, and LARS (polyethylene terephthalate) synthetic graft. The time elapsed from primary ACLR to the first stage surgery ranged from 1.7 years to 9.7 years, whereas the time elapsed between the first and second stage ranged from 21 weeks to 13.6 months. Six different bone grafting options were reported, with the most common being iliac crest autograft, allograft bone dowels, and allograft bone chips. During definitive reconstruction, hamstring autograft and BPTB autograft were the most commonly used grafts. Studies reporting patient-reported outcome measures showed improvement from preoperative to postoperative levels in Lysholm, Tegner, and objective International Knee and Documentation Committee scores. Conclusions Tunnel malpositioning and widening remain the most common indications for 2-stage revision ACLR. Bone grafting is commonly reported using iliac crest autograft and allograft bone chips and dowels, whereas hamstring autograft and BPTB autograft were the most used grafts during the second-stage definitive reconstruction.

The combination of injectable hydrogels and the science of stem cells have emerged to address this persistent issue in society by generating minimally invasive treatments to augment tissue function. Hydrogels are composed of a cross-linked network of polymers that exhibit a high-water retention capacity, thereby mimicking the wet environment of native cells. Due to their inherent mechanical softness, hydrogels can be used as needle-injectable stem cell carrier materials to mend tissue defects. Hydrogels are made of different natural or synthetic polymers, displaying a broad portfolio of eligible properties, which include biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, shear-thinning properties as well as tunable biological and physicochemical properties. Presently, novel ongoing developments and native-like hydrogels are increasingly being used broadly to improve the quality of life of those with disabling tissue-related diseases.

However, in reality, the world's energy majority cannot make U-turn immediately to renewables or clean energy due to the immature technology readiness, insufficient resource availability and unstable energy supply. In the next few decades, the fossil fuels, particularly oil and gas, will continue acting as the primary energy sector. Thus, instead of absolutely abandoning fossil fuel and seeking for impractical carbon mitigation technologies, to decarbonise the oil and gas will be definitely feasible and contribute more to net-zero transitions. This study, initially put eyes on the oil and gas decarbonization, critically reviewing the oil and gas resources, technologies, policies, and their futures toward net-zero. Basically, the status of oil and gas resources from different global regions, including the details of reserves, productions, consumptions, are summarized and analyzed. Moreover, the oil and gas technologies are categorized as gas, thermal and non-thermal, new recovery methods, each of which is specifically discussed in the applicable reservoir, mechanism, features and examples. Then, the global carbon emissions are reviewed in perspectives of emissions from fuel types and world regions as well as mitigations policies. Accordingly, the carbon mitigation approaches, specially in the oil and gas industry, are collected and listed from enterprise managements and technology renovations. Lastly, based on all the information and analyses and assisted with IEA energy outlook report, we provide a potential pathway for the oil and gas towards carbon neutral. This paper provides comprehensive overview on the oil and gas pathway to net-zero, which will not only technically guide the oil and gas decarbonisations, also be of interest to wide-range readers who are not experts but intend to understand the energy transitions.","Oil and gas decarbonization, Net zero, Energy transition, Review and outlook"

Accordingly, this review identifies that particle size is a key factor determining the structure and composition of CGFS. Based on the analysis of the CGFS characterizations, froth flotation shows great application potential for carbon-ash separation from CGFS under the premise of reagent recycling.

They can lead to irreversible joint damage and increase the risk of progression to osteoarthritis. Current treatments for osteochondral injuries are not curative and only target symptoms, highlighting the need for a tissue engineering solution. Scaffold-based approaches can be used to assist osteochondral tissue regeneration, where biomaterials tailored to the properties of cartilage and bone are used to restore the defect and minimise the risk of further joint degeneration. This review captures original research studies published since 2015, on multiphasic scaffolds used to treat osteochondral defects in animal models. These studies used an extensive range of biomaterials for scaffold fabrication, consisting mainly of natural and synthetic polymers. Different methods were used to create multiphasic scaffold designs, including by integrating or fabricating multiple layers, creating gradients, or through the addition of factors such as minerals, growth factors, and cells. The studies used a variety of animals to model osteochondral defects, where rabbits were the most commonly chosen and the vast majority of studies reported small rather than large animal models. The few available clinical studies reporting cell-free scaffolds have shown promising early-stage results in osteochondral repair, but long-term follow-up is necessary to demonstrate consistency in defect restoration. Overall, preclinical studies of multiphasic scaffolds show favourable results in simultaneously regenerating cartilage and bone in animal models of osteochondral defects, suggesting that biomaterials-based tissue engineering strategies may be a promising solution.","Osteochondral defects, Tissue engineering, Multiphasic scaffolds, Biomaterials, Animal models"

After describing the application of natural clays to environmental problems, the remainder of the review is devoted to products that can improve environmental quality. These include adsorbents for the removal of various types of pollutant from waters, including heavy metals, organic and inorganic molecules. Clay-derived products also have roles in the destruction of organic waste, the production of environmental sensors, and combating various other environmental problems. Important roles exist for clay minerals in clean energy production, including light harvesting by hybrid materials based on complexes between porphyrins and clay minerals, and biofuel production where pillared clays have a role in the cracking of vegetable oils, and clay-based composites could act as storage media for H2. The swelling properties of smectite clays form the basis for their use as environmental barriers, and these can be improved by composite materials based on clay-polymer complexes. Clays also have a role as lubricants in drilling fluids, and strategies for improving the efficiency of drilling muds are described. In addition, clay-derived products could have important uses in the control of atmospheric emissions, and the collection of CO2 for use in the food and drinks industry. Finally, some other uses of clay-derived products are mentioned briefly, including complexes of clays with natural fibers as biodegradable food packaging materials, and as media for the slow release of fertilizers, pesticides and preservatives.

7,MANDUNA2023101281,"Manduna, Kennedy",Are mining-induced displacement and resettlement losses compensable? Evidence and lessons from mining communities in Zimbabwe,The Extractive Industries and Society,15,,101281,2023,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X23000710,"This paper aims to examine the intractable paradox in compensating the victims of the mining-induced resettlements and displacement (MIDR) policy interventions in Zimbabwe. On the one hand, mining laws, notably the Mines and Minerals Act, do not provide for the direct compensation of Communal Land dwellers/occupiers. On the other hand, mining companies directly compensate these Communal Land dwellers/occupiers- however insufficiently, unjustly, unfairly, and untimely. To illuminate this paradox, the experiences of about 4,321 Chiadzwa families resettled at Arda Transau farm between 2009 and 2016; Murowa Diamonds’ 224 families (and 265 graves) MIDR victims resettled in the Shashe area in 2005; and Rio Tinto's Murowa Diamonds’ 926 people relocated in six farms bought by the company under the resettlement program in 2004 are taken as case studies. In this qualitative case study research, document analysis, key informant interviews and non-participant observation were used for data collection, and content and thematic analysis methods for data presentation and analysis. The distinctiveness of this paper lies not in presenting Zimbabwe's mining-induced displacement experiences, as these experiences are a global phenomenon. Instead, the paper's uniqueness lies in articulating the different outcomes of Zimbabwe's mining-induced displacement and resettlement policy interventions due to the lack or inadequacy of compensation to the victims following involuntary relocations. This paper, therefore, suggests the following displacement compensation policy interventions: monetary compensation; livelihood restoration; and joblessness, homelessness and landlessness prevention. Lastly, the paper recommends inserting a section in the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill that deals with adequately compensating the victims of MIDR policy interventions.","Internally displaced persons, Internal displacement, Mining, Mining-induced resettlements and displacements, Zimbabwe, Compensation, Human rights"

NO is a potent redox cue, efficiently relayed between proteins through its co-valent attachment to highly specific, powerfully reactive protein cysteine (Cys) thiols, resulting in formation of protein S-nitrosothiols (SNOs). This process, known as S-nitrosylation, can modulate the function of target proteins, enabling responsiveness to cellular redox changes. Key targets of S-nitrosylation control the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the transcription of immune-response genes, the triggering of the hypersensitive response (HR) and the establishment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Here, we bring together recent advances in the control of plant immunity by S-nitrosylation, furthering our appreciation of how changes in cellular redox status reprogramme plant immune function.",#NAME?
