The paper investigates the negative effects on the environment caused by unsustainable management of municipal solid trash as well as the opportunities presented by the formal system. This examination looks at the origins of solid waste as well as the typical treatment methods. Pyrolysis methods, feedstock pyrolysis, and lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis were highlighted. Explain in detail the various thermochemical processes that take place during the pyrolysis of biomass. Due to its carbon content, low cost, accessibility, ubiquitousness, renewable nature, and environmental friendliness, biomass waste is a unique biochar precursor. This study looks at the different types of biomass waste that are available for treating wastewater. This study discussed a wide variety of reactors. Adsorption is the standard method that is used the most frequently to remove hazardous organic, dye, and inorganic pollutants from wastewater. These pollutants cause damage to the environment and water supplies, thus it is important to remove them. Adsorption is both simple and inexpensive to utilize. Temperature-dependent conversions explain the kinetic theories of biomaterial biochemical degradation. This article presents a review that explains how pyrolytic breakdown char materials can be used to reduce pollution and improve environmental management.","","Biochar, Pyrolysis, Remediation, Solid wastes, Thermo-chemical, Valorization","",""

The bioaccumulation of these heavy metals inside our bodies and pecking orders will influence our people in the future. Bioremediation is a bio-mechanism where residing organic entities use and reuse the squanders that are reused to one more form. This could be accomplished by taking advantage of the property of explicit biomolecules or biomass that is equipped for restricting by concentrating the necessary heavy metal particles. The microorganisms can't obliterate the metal yet can change it into a less harmful substance. In this unique circumstance, this review talks about the sources, poisonousness, impacts, and bioremediation strategies of five heavy metals: lead, mercury, arsenic, chromium, and manganese. The concentrations here are the ordinary strategies for bioremediation such as biosorption methods, the use of microbes, green growth, and organisms, etc. This review demonstrates the toxicity of heavy metal contamination degradation by biotransformation through bacterioremediation and biodegradation through mycoremediation.","","Bioremediation, Environmental pollution, Bioaccumulation, Toxicity, Biosorption","",""

Being considered a global pollutant, high pools of Hg-emissions ranging from >6000 to 8000 Mg Hg/year get accumulated by the natural and anthropogenic activities in the atmosphere. These toxicants have high persistence, toxicity, and widespread contamination in the soil, water, and air resources. Hg accumulation inside the plant parts amplifies the traces of toxic elements in the linking food chains, leads to Hg exposure to humans, and acts as a potential genotoxic, neurotoxic and carcinogenic entity. However, excessive Hg levels are equally toxic to the plant system and severely disrupt the physiological and metabolic processes in plants. Thus, a plausible link between Hg-concentration and its biogeochemical behavior is highly imperative to analyze the plant-soil interactions. Therefore, it is requisite to bring these toxic contaminants in between the acceptable limits to safeguard the environment. Plants efficiently incorporate or absorb the bioavailable Hg from the soil thus a constructive understanding of Hg uptake, translocation/sequestration involving specific heavy metal transporters, and detoxification mechanisms are drawn. Whereas recent investigations in biological remediation of Hg provide insights into the potential associations between the plants and microbes. Furthermore, intense research on Hg-induced antioxidants, protein networks, metabolic mechanisms, and signaling pathways is required to understand these bioremediations techniques. This review sheds light on the mercury (Hg) sources, pollution, biogeochemical cycles, its uptake, translocation, and detoxification methods with respect to its molecular approaches in plants.","","MDA- Malondialdehyde, TBARS- Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, SH- Sulfhydryl, Nanoparticles, Transporter proteins, MRB-Mercury-resistant bacteria","",""

The wastewater, which contains heavy metal ions, poses an acute threat to human health if not properly cleaned, making its disposal of paramount importance. Due to its adaptable design, efficient operation, and low cost, the nanofiltration (NF) membrane is one of the most successful methods for removing heavy metals from wastewater. NF membranes made from innovative materials are gaining popularity as a result of their many advantageous features, including their ability to treat wastewater in a variety of situations. To remove heavy metal ions from wastewater, the modification of NF membrane using interfacial polymerization (IP) and grafting techniques, as well as its subsequent development via nanofiller addition, is the most effective way to tailor the properties of NF membranes. Many aspects of NF membrane modification in terms of their preparation, characteristics, and performance have been introduced. This review discusses the modification processes and performances of NF membranes for heavy metal remediation from wastewater. The findings elucidated the roles and benefits of innovative membranes for the treatment of wastewater containing heavy metals. It has been observed that high rejection is enabled by electrostatic charge induction, the creation of chelating complexes and the tuning of pore size while the high permeability and antifouling properties can be achieved through the addition of hydrophilic nanofillers. The economical and non-toxic application of polyhydroxy phenols compounds for enhancing the permeability and capture rate of heavy metal ions is also suggested for study. Finally, the research gaps and uncertainties of these NF membranes in the treatment of water contaminated with heavy metals are highlighted.","","Heavy metal removal, Nanofiltration, Interfacial polymerization, Grafting, Nanofiller materials, Wastewater","",""

Since many climatic hazards cannot be prevented, recognizing the underlying factors that render societies more vulnerable might facilitate pragmatic measures for minimizing the likelihood of disasters. With this impulse, the current study developed an innovative framework for appraising various societal attributes, the interplay of which potentially adds to the vulnerabilities of the coastal region of Bangladesh. In our study, we harnessed the notion of sensitivity used in disaster discourse and proposed five major domains of sensitivity namely demographic setback, inadequacy of basic resources, economic marginality, socio-cultural impediments and fragility of policy and governance, based on the conceptual adaptation of the prior social vulnerability frameworks. A total of thirty-five context-specific variables were consolidated under these five domains. To determine the weights of the variables, the popular Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was applied. Respective variables were summed up with appropriate weights to generate the five subindices which were eventually integrated using the additive (averaging) approach to develop a composite sensitivity index for the nineteen coastal districts. The outcomes of the sensitivity assessment were spatially mapped. Coxsbazar (0.60), Pirojpur (0.39) Bagerhat (0.38), Shariatpur (0.37), Patuakhali (0.34), and Chandpur (0.33) were the most sensitive districts, which is attributable to diverse key factors. Our study thus delineates the areas that require prioritized actions for reducing vulnerability and offers an opportunity to improve the prevailing interventions aimed at Disaster Risk Reduction across the coastal region of Bangladesh. Moreover, the integration of factors like child labor, violence against women, early marriage of girls, corruption, and crime that have not been previously considered, but often act as factors shaping increased vulnerability render the current framework a conceptual advancement for understanding sensitivity to climate-related disasters in other developing countries of the world.","","Climate-related disasters, Coastal region of Bangladesh, Societal attributes, Composite index, Analytic hierarchy process (AHP)","",""

When the complex interplay between pro- and antiangiogenic mediators falls out of balance, angiogenesis can quickly become harmful. As it is so fundamental, both its inhibition and enhancement take part in various diseases, making it a target for therapeutic treatments. Current methods come with limitations, therefore, novel agents are constantly being researched, with metal agents offering promising results. Various transition metals have already been investigated in-depth, with studies indicating both pro- and antiangiogenic properties, respectively. The transition metals are being applied in various formulations, such as nanoparticles, complexes, or scaffold materials. Albeit the increasing attention this field is receiving, there remain many unanswered questions, mostly regarding the molecular mechanisms behind the observed effects. Notably, approximately half of all the transition metals have not yet been investigated regarding potential angiogenic effects.

The developed chemosensor was fabricated by the direct impregnation of a chromoionophoric probe composed of 2,3-bis((4-isopropylbenzylidene)amino)maleonitrile (PDPM) onto the surface of structurally tailored porous polymer monolithic framework. The template exhibited a highly porous network with greater surface area, which led to the effective anchoring of probe molecules onto the surface of the polymer template, thus serving as an efficient platform to constitute a regenerative solid-state chemosensor. The sensor rendered a superior color shift from dull white to dijon yellow after complexing with Hg2+. The surface, structural, and morphological aspects of the sensor were evaluated using FE-SEM, HR-TEM, EDAX, SAED, p-XRD, N2 adsorption isotherm, and XPS. Rigorous optimization of the effects of different analytical parameters on the sensing performance of the PDPM sensor material was ensured. The monolithic sensor had an optimum sensing performance at pH 8.0, rapid signal response kinetics of 60s and a broad linear response range of 0.5–150.0 μg/L with a 0.22 μg/L detection limit. Furthermore, the sensor was also tolerant of foreign matrix constituents, thereby enabling it to be highly selective in detecting Hg2+. Sensor recovery was analyzed to be possible via Hg2+ desorption using 0.01 M EDTA without compromising its sensing performance. It had reutilization potential for up to eight regenerative cycles with excellent data reliability (recovery ≥99.4% and RSD ≤1.4%). The practicability of the fabricated sensor was investigated using various water and cigarette samples. Experimental data revealed that the developed chromoionophoric sensor was reusable, eco-friendly, low-cost, and possessed superior sensing capabilities, making it more feasible for on-site analysis of environmental samples.

Throughout the centuries, the evolution of food processing has led to an increase of food safety and quality, enhancing the overall quality of human life. Lately, academic research and industries have gained awareness about the impact of conventional preservation technologies like heat sterilization and chemical preservatives on environment and economy, besides the detrimental effects on the organoleptic and nutritional quality of foods. This consciousness oriented the efforts towards more sustainable techniques, paving the way to a new “green era” of food technology. Scope and approach This work explores seven non-thermal technologies, describing their theoretical principles, mechanism of action, effect on microorganisms, advantages, and limitations. Besides, the concept of hurdle technology to overcome the criticisms related to single processing techniques is highlighted. Key findings and conclusions Non-thermal technologies have the potential to substitute conventional techniques for microbial inactivation, improving the safety and quality of food. The efficiency of each technique strongly relies on the process parameters (treatment intensity; exposure time), equipment (geometry; conformation), product (physical state; composition; viscosity; geometry), and microorganism characteristics (strain; concentration; growth phase; resistance mechanisms). In this sense, the hurdle approach allows to overcome the limitations related to the single technologies, broadening their efficiency and application range, and minimizing their impact on food quality. Further studies are recommended to better understand the mechanisms of mutual interaction among these techniques when combined together in specific conditions, in view of their scaling-up for commercial applications.","","Non-thermal techniques, Food preservation, Hurdle, Food decontamination, Green technology","",""

Plant roots are major sources of soil carbon, and resolving the dynamics and dominance of microbial consumption versus mineral sorption of root-derived carbon is critical to understanding soil carbon storage. Here we integrate in-situ rhizosphere microsensor and plant physiological measurements with a 3-D plant-soil reactive transport model to explore the fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the rhizosphere, particularly its microbial consumption and interaction with Fe oxide minerals. Over several days, microdialysis probes at the root-soil interface of growing Vicia faba roots in live soil, revealed clear diel patterns of DOC concentration in the pore water. Daytime DOC spikes coincided with peaks in leaf-level photosynthesis rates and were accompanied by declining redox potential and dissolved oxygen as well as increasing pH in the rhizosphere. Incorporating microsensor data into our modeling framework showed that the measured rapid loss of DOC after each mid-day spike could not be explained by consumption via aerobic respiration, nor via anaerobic respiration dominated by Fe oxide reduction. Rather, in the model, a large fraction of rhizosphere DOC was rapidly immobilized each day by adsorption to Fe oxides. Further, modeled microbial Fe reduction (fueled by DOC) did not mobilize significant organic carbon from Fe oxides during the day. Instead, the model predicted equilibrium desorption of organic carbon from Fe oxides at night. This new mechanistic modeling framework, which couples aboveground plant physiological measurements with non-destructive high-resolution monitoring of rhizosphere processes, has great potential for exploring the dynamics and balance of the various microbial reactions and mineral interactions controlling carbon storage in soils.","","Soil carbon, Rhizosphere, Mineral-organic associations, Mineral-associated organic matter, Diel cycles, Reactive transport modeling, Microsensors","",""
