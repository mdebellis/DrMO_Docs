Methods Demineralized dentin beams were incubated in 1%, 2% or 3% IP6 and HYP release was evaluated at 1 or 3 weeks and compared to those obtained in untreated control or phosphoric acid (PA)-treated beams. DD or MD powder was treated with 1%, 2% or 3% IP6 and the decrease in IP6 amount was quantitated by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. IP6-treated samples were re-suspended in distilled water, ethanol, urea or sodium chloride and the amount of IP6 displaced was determined. Results At 1 week, the control group and IP6 showed lower HYP release when compared to PA (P < 0.05). There was no difference among PA, IP6 and control at 3 weeks (P = 0.22). IP6 binding was concentration dependent. 1% IP6 had higher binding potential with MD compared to DD while 2% IP6 showed the opposite result (P<0.05). 3% IP6 had similar binding values between DD and MD (P = 0.53). The highest debinding in MD occurred with urea for 2%, 3% and 1% IP6 in descending manner. Within each concentration of IP6 in DD, the highest debinding effect was reported with ethanol. Conclusions IP6 bound to DD and MD in a concentration-dependent manner. IP6 was debound from DD mostly by the action of ethanol, while in MD, urea caused the most displacement. Collagen solubilization of IP6-treated DD was comparable to untreated DD. Clinical significance These findings add to the potential use of IP6 as an alternative to PA for dentin etching which possibly results in long-term stability of resin-dentin adhesion.","","Phytic acid, Collagen, Binding, Debinding, Phosphoric acid, Dentin","",""

Methods Sixty caries-free molars were divided into 6 groups according to the adhesive systems used (n = 10). The 2-ERA systems included were: 1) Adper Single Bond 2 (SB), 2) Tetric N-Bond (TB), and 3) Ambar (AM); and the UAs systems were: 4) Single Bond Universal (SBU) 5) Tetric N-Bond Universal (TBU), and 6) Ambar Universal (AMU). The occlusal third of each tooth was removed and the adhesives were applied. After the composite build-up, specimens were sectioned and tested for microtensile bond strength (µTBS) and nanoleakage (NL) immediately and after 1 year of water storage. In situ degree of conversion (DC) was only evaluated in the immediate time. For water sorption (WS), solubility (SO), and mass change (MC) tests, 48 disk-shaped specimens were prepared (n = 8) and assessed according to ISO 4049:2009. Results UAs showed higher µTBS and lower NL values than 2-ERAs did after 1 year of water storage (p = 0.001). Regarding DC, 2-ERAs showed higher DC values than UAs (p = 0.001). Regarding WS, 2-ERAs showed higher WS values than those of UAs (p = 0.00001), except for AM and AMU. Lower WS was observed for AM than for other 2-ERAs (p = 0.00001). Conclusion The use of UAs applied with the ER strategy seems to be a more effective technique for maintaining adhesion to dentin substrate than 2-ERAS. Clinical significance This study may support clinicians in selecting the most adequate adhesive system to be used in ER strategy in dentin, demonstrating that UAs were more effective, considering the longevity of the resin restorations.","","Universal adhesive, etch-and-rinse systems, dentin bond durability, dentin, tensile strength, dental leakage","",""

We performed a cost-time analysis, comparing the expenditures for retaining “unrestorable” teeth using forced orthodontic extrusion and restoration (FOE) versus extraction and ISC, in a clinical prospective cohort study. Methods Forty-two patients (n = 21 per group) were enrolled from clinical routine at a university into this study. Direct medical and indirect costs (opportunity costs) were assessed for all relevant steps (initial care, active care, restorative care, supportive care) using the private payer's perspective in German healthcare based on a micro-costing approach and/or national fee items. Statistical comparison was performed with Mann-Whitney-U test. Results Patients were followed up for at least one year after initial treatment (n = 40). The drop-out rate was 5% (n = 2). Total direct medical costs were higher for ISC (median: 3439.05€) than FOE (median: 1601.46€) with p<0.001. We observed a higher number of appointments (p = 0.002) for ISC (median: 14.5) in comparison to FOE (median: 12), while cumulatively, FOE patients spent more time in treatment (median: 402.5 min) in comparison to ISC (median: 250 min) with p<0.001, resulting in comparable opportunity costs for both treatment groups (FOE: 304.50€; ISC: 328.98€). Conclusions ISC generated higher costs than FOE. More in-depth and long-term exploration of cost-effectiveness is warranted. Clinical Significance ISCs were associated with higher initial medical costs and required more appointments than the restoration of severely compromised teeth after FOE. Treatment time was higher for patients with FOE, resulting in similar opportunity costs for both treatment approaches.

Methods Two maxillary master cast samples were prepared. The bases of both the master casts were made from zirconium oxide. The difference between the two casts was that the teeth of the [ZR] cast were produced from zirconium oxide and that of the [LD] cast were made of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic. Unlike the zirconia teeth of the [ZR] cast, the lithium disilicate teeth of the [LD] cast were glazed. The two master casts were digitized using a high-resolution scanner (Atos Compact Scan 5 M, GOM GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) to obtain digital reference casts. Subsequently, each master cast was scanned 15 times using four IOSs. The IOSs were the Cerec Omnicam [OM], Primescan [PR], Trios 4 [TR4], and VivaScan [VS]. On surface comparison, the absolute mean deviation values were obtained for trueness and precision. For multiple comparisons, statistically significant differences were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The p-value was adjusted to control for the increased risk of type I error (p < 0.0083). To compare the two means, the t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used (p < 0.05). Results Trueness values for [ZR] ranged from 24.6 (±6.3) µm for [PR] and 77.1 (±8.3) µm for [OM]. Trueness values for [LD] were between 28.3 (±6.3) µm for [PR] and 72.8 (±15.6) µm for [OM]. Precision values for [ZR] ranged from 17.6 (±3.7) µm for [PR] to 37.3 (±9.9) µm for [OM]. Precision values for [LD] ranged from 17.5 (±3.6) µm for [PR] to 41.8 (±8.7) µm for [OM]. Statistically significant differences were found among all the IOSs (p < 0.0083). The trueness values of the four IOSs did not differ significantly (p < 0.05) with respect to either the [ZR] or [LD] cast. The precision values of [OM] and [VS] differed significantly with respect to the scanned surface. Conclusions Complete arch scans achieved with the four IOSs showed significantly different trueness and precision results. [VS] and [OM] were more sensitive in terms of the scanned material. Clinical significance The latest IOSs showed the required accuracy for complete arch digital impressions in-vitro investigations. These findings should be implemented under conditions relevant to complete arch deviations, such as the construction of occlusal splints, analysis of occlusal relationships, and long-span restorations. Clinicians should be aware that the clinically acceptable threshold varies depending on the purpose of the IOS.","","Intraoral, Scanner, Accuracy, Digital, 3D comparison","",""

Materials and methods A total of 60 extracted human, single-rooted premolar teeth were endodontically treated and sectioned horizontally 2 mm above the cementoenamel junction. Sectioned teeth were restored using two reconstruction designs: endocrowns (Cendo) or post-crowns (Cpost) (n = 30 p/g). In each group, reconstructions were fabricated from 3 different CAD/CAM substrates (n = 10 p/g); a resin-based composite (Cera), a lithium disilicate glass ceramic (LiSi) and a monolithic, translucent zirconia (Zir). Additional 10 intact teeth were used as control. Restored teeth were subjected to dynamic fatigue test (10−50 N, 600,000 cycles) and thermocycling (5−55 °C, 1500 cycles). Load-to-failure and failure mode was determined following application of a static, 45° oblique compressive load on each specimen. One-way and Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey’s post hoc and chi-square tests were used to determine statistically significant interactions among experimental and control groups. Results All specimens survived the mechanical and thermal fatigue tests. A statistically significant interaction between reconstruction design and material type was observed (p  <  0.001). CpostZir and CendoCera groups exhibited significantly higher post-fatigue load-to-failure when compared to other materials of the same reconstruction design (p ≤ 0.001). The highest frequency of catastrophic failures was observed with Zir reconstructions in both designs. Intact teeth exhibited significantly higher load-to-failure when compared to all groups (p ≤ 0.042) except CpostZir (p = 0.345). Conclusion Single piece, CAD/CAM resin composite endocrowns can present a reliable option for restoring endodontically treated premolar teeth. Clinical Significance Endocrowns can be as effective as post-crowns provided appropriate preparation; material selection; and bonding protocols are utilized. Clinicians need to be cautious when prescribing zirconia endocrowns to restore premolar teeth owing to the low fracture resistance and high risk of catastrophic failures.","","Endodontic treatment, Endocrowns, Post-crowns, CAD/CAM, Zirconia, Lithium disilicate, Resin based composite, Fracture resistance","",""

Methods Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet-visible, and molecular docking were applied for separately evaluating the interactions of two monomers with hydroxyapatite and collagen. Hydrophilicity tests and morphological observation were employed to characterize pretreated dentine. Microtensile bond strength (μTBS) and nanoleakage were investigated to evaluate the bonding performance. Hydroxyproline assay, in situ zymography, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity assay were used to confirm the MMP inhibition. Results Chemoanalytic characterization confirmed the interactions of 10-MDP and PENTA with hydroxyapatite and collagen. The interactions of PENTA were weaker than 10-MDP. PENTA possessed better dentine tubule sealing after etching than 10-MDP. Dentine treated with PENTA was more hydrophilic than 10-MDP. 10-MDP and PENTA treating significantly increased the initial μTBS than the control group without primer conditioning. μTBS decreased significantly during aging, and the decrease was more severe in the PENTA group than 10-MDP. The 10-MDP and PENTA groups exhibited relatively less fluorescence than the control. The relative inhibition percentages of MMP-9 decreased in the order of 10-MDP–Ca salt, 10-MDP and PENTA. The 10-MDP, PENTA, and 10-MDP–Ca salt groups showed significantly lower hydroxyproline contents than the control. Conclusions Although PENTA adsorbed on hydroxyapatite, it did not form a stable calcium salt. The interactions of 10-MDP with hydroxyapatite and collagen are different than those of PENTA. Clinical significance The sealing of dentinal tubules by PENTA and the inhibition of MMP by 10-MDP and its calcium salts contribute to improving the dentine bonding durability.","","Phosphate ester monomer, Dentine bonding, Collagen, Hydroxyapatite, Matrix metalloproteinases","",""

Since most authors found the loss of retention of refitable post and cores as the most common cause of failure, it is impossible to draw a conclusion on tooth survival on the results of those studies. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to improve the clinical evidence on the survival of teeth treated with post and cores on a large number of cases over a long observation period. Materials and methods 735 patients were treated with 1053 post and cores in the observation period (2004–2022) and could be included in the study. The patient files were analysed due to the parameters: Type of covering prosthetic restoration, location, type of tooth, luting material, post and core material, bone attachment and therapist. The survival probability was assessed using Kaplan-Meyer analysis. Cox regression was used to assess possible multifactorial influences. Results The overall average survival time until necessary extraction of a tooth restored with a post and core was 11.74 years. A root fracture in primary crown retained removeable partial dentures (RPDs) during the first five years was the most common reason for extraction in this study. A significant influence on the survival time of teeth restored with post and cores was found for the type of covering restoration, bone attachment, age of the patient and post and core material.

Methods A total of 147 prostheses (in 94 patients) placed by undergraduate dental students in a university dental center during the period 2015–2021 were examined clinically using modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) and California Dental Association (CDA) criteria. The mean duration of follow-up was 37 months (range, 6 - 63 months) for the single crowns (n = 77) and 25 months (range, 6 - 68 months) for the 3-unit FDPs (n = 70). Data were descriptively analyzed to determine the types and rates of complications based on USPHS and CDA criteria. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimation method was used to determine the cumulative survival and success rates of the prostheses (α=0.05). Differences in clinical outcomes (survival or failure) according to tooth vitality, luting cement, and location were statistically analyzed using cross-tabulations and Х2 test (α=0.05). Results The Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival rate was estimated as 96% for the Zi 3-unit FDPs after 5.5 years, and 90% for the Zi single crowns after 4.8 years. The 5-year estimated success rate was 68% for both 3-unit FDPs and single crowns.

We calculated the costs of prosthetic rehabilitation and analyzed whether costs of treatment begun in early adolescence are lower compared with in early adulthood. Methods : Data from the dental records of 25 patients with AI and 25 age- and sex-matched controls were analyzed. Patients were followed for a mean period of 12.3 ± 1.5 years. Number of dental visits, dental treatment costs, and indirect costs were calculated during three time periods, before, during and after prosthetic therapy. Swedish national reference prices for general and specialist dental care were used. Results : The mean number of visits was significantly higher in the AI group: 43.3 ± 19.7 (controls: 17.5 ± 19.8; p < .001). Mean total costs were 8.5 times higher for patients with AI: €16,257 ± 5,595 (controls: €1,904 ± 993). Mean number of crowns made in patients with AI was 12 ± 7 (range 1 − 31). Indirect costs were significantly higher in the AI group and constituted 22% of the total costs. After crown therapy, costs between groups ceased to differ significantly. Calculations of total costs in the hypothetical scenario (discount rate at 3% annually) were €18,475 for prosthetic rehabilitation began at age 12 years compared with €20,227 if treatment began at 20 years of age. Conclusions : Prosthetic rehabilitation costs for children and adolescents with AI can be high. Early crown therapy is associated with lower costs and a lower number of dental visits.

Completion of root development was achieved in more than 83% of the cases in all VPT techniques. Conclusions All treatment modalities for PP were equally efficient with high overall success rates. Biodentine showed high success rates regardless of technique. No significant differences were found in the clinical and radiographic success rates between various follow-up intervals. There are no clear conclusions regarding superiority of either VPT technique on apical closure. Clinical significance This manuscript systematically evaluates the evidence and summarises all available data on each vital pulp therapy technique and materials used in treatment of deep caries in immature permanent teeth with vital pulps. The limitations in the current scientific literature and recommendations for future research are also highlighted.","","Immature permanent teeth, Deep dentin caries, Vital pulp therapy, Systematic review","",""

Methods The enamel shear bond strengths of NACP adhesives were measured compared to commercial adhesive (Scotchbond Multi-Purpose, 3 M). Adhesive disks containing NACP were tested for calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) ions release. Four groups were tested: (1) enamel control, (2) enamel with NACP, (3) enamel with SN15-PAMAM, and (4) enamel with SN15-PAMAM + NACP. The specimens were treated with cyclic artificial saliva/demineralizing solution for 28 days. The remineralized enamel specimens were examined by surface and cross-sectional hardness test. Results NACP adhesive yielded a similar shear bond strength to commercial control (Scotchbond Multi-Purpose, 3 M). NACP adhesive released high levels of Ca and P ions. At 28 days, the enamel hardness of SN15-PAMAM + NACP group was 2.89 ± 0.13 GPa, significantly higher than that of control group (1.46 ± 0.10 GPa) (p < 0.05). SN15-PAMAM + NACP increased the enamel cross-sectional hardness at 28 days; at 25 μm, enamel cross-sectional hardness was 90 % higher than that of control group (p < 0.05). Significance The novel SN15-PAMAM + NACP adhesive method could achieve 90 % higher enamel remineralization of the artificial caries than the control under acid challenge for the first time. This method is promising for use after tooth cavity preparation, or as a coating on enamel with white spot lesions (WSLs) for prevention, to reduce secondary caries, prevent caries procession and protect tooth structures.","","Enamel remineralization, Statherin protein poly(amidoamine) dendrimer, Adhesive, pH cycling, Nano-calcium phosphate, Enamel hardness","",""

Methods Participants were 7- to 16-year-old children referred to a UK Dental Hospital for management of incisor opacities. Prior to treatment (To), participants completed validated questionnaires to assess OHRQoL and overall health status (C−OHIP-SF19), and self-concept (Harter’s Self-Perception Profile for Children [SPPC]). Interventions for MIH included microabrasion, resin infiltration, tooth whitening or composite resin restoration. Children were reviewed after six months (T1) when they re-completed the C−OHIP-SF19 and SPPC questionnaires. The relationships of predictors with improvement of children’s OHRQoL (T1-To) and children’s overall health status at T1 were assessed using linear and ordinal logistic regression respectively, guided by the Wilson and Cleary’s theoretical model. Results Of 103 participants, 86 were reviewed at T1 (83.5 % completion rate). Their mean age was 11-years (range = 7−16) and 60 % were female. Total and domain OHRQoL scores significantly increased (improved OHRQoL) following MIH treatment. There was a significant positive change in SPPC physical appearance subscale score between To and T1. A higher number of anterior teeth requiring aesthetic treatment were associated with poor improvement of socio-emotional wellbeing at T1 (Coef =-0.43). Higher self-concept at To was associated with greater improvement of socio-emotional wellbeing at T1 (ß = 3.44). Greater orthodontic treatment need (i.e. higher IOTN-AC score) at T0 was linked to worse overall oral health at T1 (OR = 0.43). Conclusions Psychosocial factors and dental clinical characteristics were associated with change in children’s OHRQoL following minimal interventions for incisor opacities. Clinical significance MIH is a common condition and clinicians should be aware of the negative impacts some children experience, particularly those with multiple anterior opacities, poor tooth alignment and low self-concept. However, simple, minimally invasive treatments can provide good clinical and psychosocial outcomes and should be offered to children reporting negative effects.","","Children, Oral health-related quality of life, Enamel opacities, Molar incisor hypomineralisation, Aesthetic treatment","",""

High success rates have been reported for the use of pulpotomy in managing pulp exposure resulting from extensive caries. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pulpotomy and associated medicaments in saving permanent teeth with pulp exposure resulting from extensive caries. Sources Multiple databases were searched on January 12, 2019, without limitations on the language or year of publication. Study selection Randomized controlled trials comparing pulpotomy with alternative treatments, or comparing two or more medicaments in pulpotomy for permanent teeth with carious pulp exposure were included. Data Seventeen studies reported in 21 articles were included. Intention-to-treat analyses on studies comparing pulpotomy and other treatment modalities tended to favor pulpotomy. Meta-analysis was not performed on comparisons of pulpotomy and other treatments because of the limited number of studies. Most evidence on comparisons among different pulpotomy medicaments was found in trials comparing mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and calcium hydroxide, with the results of meta-analyses favoring MTA. Data were insufficient to determine the cost-effectiveness of successful modality. Conclusions Pulpotomy is a prospective substitute for root canal treatment in managing permanent teeth with carious pulp exposures, even in permanent teeth with irreversible pulpitis. Large, well-designed trials comparing pulpotomy with other treatments in terms of cost-effectiveness should be informative. Clinical significance The success of pulpotomy in managing irreversible pulpitis challenges the rhetoric that irreversible pulpitis can only be managed by root canal treatment. Cost-effectiveness analysis rather than analysis on effectiveness of treatment outcome alone should be considered in all health care domains to evaluate the benefits of alternative treatment options.","","Cost-benefit analysis, Dental caries, Meta-analysis, Pulpotomy, Pulpitis, Systematic review","",""

Different material types with varying flexural strength and modulus of elasticity were compared with screw-retained or bonded application. Materials and methods Identical anterior FDPs (tooth 11–13; n = 80) from materials (flexural strength 240−1150 MPa, modulus 7.6−210 GPa; 1x lithiumdisilicate ceramic, 2x zirconia (4Y-TZP, 5Y-FSZ), 3x resin-based composites (with different flexural strength and modulus)) were milled. FDPs were grouped into chairside (bonded) and labside (screw-retained) procedure. To simulate a 5-year clinical application, thermal cycling with mechanical loading (TCML) was accomplished. TCML-performance and fracture force were evaluated and failure patterns were analysed. Data were statistically investigated (Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test, one-way-ANOVA; post-hoc-Bonferroni, α = 0.05). Results TCML did not lead to any cracks, fractures or chipping on all tested FDPs. Fracture values varied between 1208.9 ± 354.6 N (experimental resin-based composite) and 2094.3 ± 293.4 N (4Y-TZP) for FDPs without screw channel. With screw channel the results ranged between 1297.9 ± 268.3 N (5Y-FSZ) and 2129.3 ± 321.7 N (4Y-TZP). The influence of the screw channel was not significant for all materials (p ≥ 0.218). Modulus of elasticity and flexural strength had influence on the fracture force only in the individual material groups. Fractures at the connector were predominant for ceramic and zirconia. Resin-based composites primarily showed radial fractures in abutment region or mixed failure types. FDPs with/without screw-channel showed comparable types of failure. Conclusions TCML did not lead to drop-outs or failures for all FDPs. Individual materials showed no different in-vitro performance, but varying fracture force after TCML. Independent from material, screw channels did not weaken the FDPs.

It can also be used in the digital workflow when a control model is needed to improve the fit of the prosthesis. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how dimensional accuracy is affected by different splinting techniques and time factors. Objectives To evaluate the time factor on the dimensional stability of different implant impression splinting techniques used in the conventional and digital workflow. Materials and methods Ten pairs of implant analogs were fixed to a stainless steel bar. Modified impression copings were connected to the analogs and eight splinting strategies evaluated (n=10): (1) type I impression plaster (PLA), (2) autopolymerizing acrylic resin, cut and rejoin technique (PTR), (3) light-cured acrylic resin, cut and rejoin technique (ILC), (4) light-cured acrylic resin, no cutting and rejoining (ILN), (5) VPS bite registration material (SBR), (6) bis-acryl bite registration material (LXB), (7) bis‐acryl composite resin (PTP), (8) 3D printed splint (3DP). In each group, the position of modified impression copings was scanned with a laboratory scanner at different time points: (1) unsplinted impression copings (baseline), (2) 2 h after splinting, (3) 24 h after splinting. Modified impression coping design allowed using metrology software to measure and compare distance, vertical, angle and rotational deviations between impression copings. Results All types of splints showed dimensional deviations. After 2 h of splinting, the lowest distance deviation was recorded in PTR (15.4±6.15µm), vertical deviation – in ILC (19.2±27.37µm), angle deviation – in ILC (0.08±0.1°), rotation – in LXB (0.2±0.24°) groups. Comparing results 2 and 24 h after connection of impression copings, statistically significant deviations in the distance were recorded in groups PLA (-5.6±5.95 µm), PTR (5.5±7.01µm), ILN (19.2±14.26µm), PTP (23.8±12.55µm). Conclusions The best dimensional accuracy was observed in the ILC group, followed by PTR and 3DP groups.

Data The review followed the PRISMA Extension Statement for network meta-analysis. Studies were identified by a systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Study selection The inclusion criteria were in vitro studies that evaluated bond strength data of samples analyzed at both immediate and long-term (after aging simulation) periods and that were bonded to sound dentin/enamel using SE adhesives, with at least one group of adhesives being based on 10-MDP (10-methacryloyloxy-decyl-dihydrogen-phosphate; control) and the other group being comprised of alternative acidic monomers. Statistical analyses were conducted using two methods: standard pairwise meta-analysis (SPMA) and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA). Heterogeneity was assessed by using the Cochran Q test and I2 statistics. Results From 5220 studies identified, 87 met the eligibility criteria and 83 were meta-analyzed. Seventeen adhesives were based on 10-MDP and 44 systems were based on alternative acids. The resin-dentin/enamel bonds were predominantly reduced after aging (∼84% of cases). From the SPMA findings, the following acidic compositions showed lower bond strength values (effect size: mean difference [MD] with 95% confidence interval [95% CI]) than 10-MDP: 4-META (MD -4.99, 95% CI: -7.21, -2.78; p<0.001); sulfonic acids (MD -9.59, 95% CI -12.19, -6.98; p<0.001); unspecified phosphate esters (MD -8.89, 95% CI -17.50, -0.28; p = 0.04); or mixed acids (MD -11.0, 95% CI -13.62, -8.38; p<0.001). The dental bonds were benefited from the presence of 10-MDP upon longer aging (>6 months). From the NMA probabilistic findings, adhesives based on 10-MDP and phosphonic acids ranked as having the best and the worst bonding potential to dentin, respectively. More than one composition (phosphonic acids and mixed acids) ranked similarly to 10-MDP in enamel. The studies scored as having moderate risk of bias (58.6%), followed by low (39.1%) and high (2.3%) risk of bias. Conclusion 10-MDP is an outstanding acidic monomer that contributes to higher bonds to dentin at the long-term. In enamel, there is no evidence that one acidic composition prevails over the other. Clinical significance The acidic composition of SE adhesives affects the resistance of dental bonds after simulated aging, with 10-MDP playing a significant role in the adhesion to dentin but not to the enamel.

SD-OCT wavelengths (1310/1550 nm) and frequencies (5/28 kHz) that are particularly suitable for these materials were investigated. Subsequently, a clinical simulation was performed with an adhesively or self-adhesively inserted partial crown made of a ceramic that had an OCT penetration depth of > 1.0 mm. Results Best SD-OCT penetration was obtained at 1550 nm and 28 kHz. For ZLS, LS2 and LAS, SD-OCT light penetration depth of > 4 mm was shown. In contrast, the penetration depth of ZRO, PIC and FEL was less than 1 mm. Adhesive and self-adhesive luting agents could be visualized up to ≥ 0.9 mm.

The reference impressions of each length group were taken using a light-body polyvinyl siloxane impression material and were scanned with an extraoral scanner. The recorded standard tessellation language (STL) data of all impressions were uploaded to a 3D matching program for the trueness evaluation via the root mean square (RMS) calculation. For the statistical analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Mann-Whitney U nonparametric tests were performed to compare the differences among the groups (α=0.05). Results The median RMS values increased in direct proportion to the length of the post space from 10 mm (357.1 µm) to 20 mm (897.5 µm). We noted a significant difference among groups (p< 0.001).

The generated CAD was used to mill CAISFP frameworks in Ti, PEEK, or PEKK (each n = 10). The frameworks were digitized with an industrial light scanner to superimpose resulting standard tessellation language (STL) file with the CAD file. Deviations at five points at the abutment-framework interface of each of the four abutment sites (1:left first molar, 2:left canine, 3:right canine, 4:right first molar sites) were calculated (trueness).

A nonparametric repeated measures ANOVA by Brunner and Puri with factors being abutment location and material was performed to assess the mean deviations for trueness and mean marginal gaps, followed by Mann-Whitney or exact Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests (alpha=.05). Results Material type significantly affected the trueness (p<0.0001). PEEK had the lowest deviations (0.039 +/-0.01mm) followed by PEKK (0,049 +/-0.009mm), and Ti (0.074 +/-0.011mm).

Only EX0 did not result in significant difference in retention rate at 24 M when compared with baseline but showed a significant higher retention rate when compared with those of EX2 and EX5 (p = 0.001). Conclusion Adding proanthocyanidins to the adhesive solution jeopardized the retention of composite resins restorations in non-carious cervical lesions after 24 months. Clinical relevance In spite of being user-friendlier than when used separately, the incorporation of proanthocyanidins into the adhesive solution impairs the longevity of composite restorations.","","Dentin-bonding agents, Non-carious cervical lesions, Proanthocyanidins, Longevity, Clinical trial","",""

Background Cracks are a common clinical finding in teeth and yet clinicians still struggle to identify the full extent and orientation of cracks for their appropriate timely management. The biomechanics of crack development can be due to multiple factors and can differ from an unrestored tooth to a restored or endodontically treated tooth. Data & sources This narrative review has been designed following the guidelines published by Green et al. 2006 [1] Published literature in the English language that addresses the objectives of this review up to July 2022 was sourced from online databases and reference lists. The relevance of the papers was assessed and discussed by two reviewers. A total of 101 publications were included in this narrative review. Conclusions The initiation and development of cracks in teeth are likely linked to an interplay between the masticatory forces and fracture resistance of the remaining tooth structure. From the identified literature, the quality and quantity of remaining tooth structure in a restored or endodontically-treated tooth affects the biomechanics of crack development compared to an unrestored tooth. The extent, orientation, and size of the cracks do affect a clinician's ability to detect cracks in teeth. There is still a need to develop reliable diagnostic tools that will accurately identify cracks in teeth beneath restorations to enable effective monitoring of their propagation and provide appropriate interventions. Clinical significance The development and propagation of cracks in an unrestored tooth differ greatly from a restored and endodontically treated tooth; mainly linked to the quantity and quality of the remaining tooth structure and the forces acting on them. Identifying the extent of cracks in teeth remains challenging for early clinical intervention.","","Cracked tooth, Fractured tooth, Cracked tooth syndrome, Dental crack propagation","",""

Methods Six- to eight- years old children, who received pulpotomy of first immature permanent molar using one layer novel CSC (Protooth) or two layers slow-setting MTA (MTA Angelus) covered with glass ionomer were recalled for radiographic and clinical evaluation after two years. The effects of cement type, age, gender, jaw, anesthesia type, and restoration type were assessed on the clinical success of pulpotomy and continued root formation (apexogenesis) as the treatment outcome. Results Out of 366 included teeth in the study, 316 teeth were available for statistical analysis. The mean observation time was 28.2 ± 2.7 months. Novel CSC showed significantly higher clinical success rate (93.1%) compared to MTA (84.5%).

The specimens were imaged and measured using microcomputed tomography (microCT) at 7 time points: pre-demineralisation, after demineralisation for two weeks, immediately after treatment, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment. The 3-month group was evaluated with a light microscope, attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope (SEM)/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Data were analysed by Dunn's test and Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction for microCT, and Kruskal–Wallis test and two-way analysis of variance for EDS characterisation. Results MicroCT images showed high mineral density beneath dentine lesions in Safo+Fuji. The mineral density at 600 μm in Safo+Fuji increased significantly over time, while Safo showed an opposite trend (adjusted p<0.005). In Safo+Fuji, EDS revealed significantly high energy of fluorine (p<0.05, at 300 μm) and a tendency towards high energy of calcium (p>0.05). However, Safo+Fuji showed lower energy of silver compared to Safo (p<0.001). ATR-FTIR revealed that phosphate groups had the highest peak at a depth between 300 and 400 μm in Safo+Fuji. Conclusions Safo+Fuji was effective in remineralising the deep lesion in dentine after one and three months, and a hypermineralisation zone generated beneath the lesion demonstrated additional benefit in this study.

The materials were submitted to etching with 5% or 10% hydrofluoric acid for 20, 40, 60, or 90 s. A control group for each material was evaluated without any surface treatment, totaling nine experimental groups for each material (n = 10). The specimens were evaluated for surface roughness (Ra and Rz), confocal optical microscopy, the contact angle (θ), surface free energy (γs), total free interaction energy (∆G) using a goniometer, and microshear bond strength to resin cement. Specimen images were obtained using scanning electron microscopy, confocal optical microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Data on the surface roughness, the contact angle, surface free energy, total free interaction energy, and bond strength were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey´s test (α=0.05).

It is generally associated with disappearance of the enamel-cementum junction, a key landmark, and a surface discrepancy requiring restoration or compensation using a connective tissue graft (CTG). The aim of this systematic review is to study the efficacy of periodontal plastic surgery on recession defects associated with a NCCL, with or without restorative treatment. Materials and methods RCT assessing the root coverage of teeth with Miller's class I and class II isolated gingival recession with an NCCL published up to April 2020, with at least 10 patients per group and a follow-up longer than 6 months, were included through electronic databases and hand-searched journals. Results Seven articles were finally included. Treatment systematically consisted of a coronally advanced flap in association with partial or complete restorative treatment ± CTG. Meta-analyses showed that periodontal plastic procedures are less effective in terms of complete root coverage in cases of teeth with an NCCL. Overall Mean Recession Reduction was 2.00 mm (CI: [1.72, 2.28]), and overall mean complete root coverage was 5% (CI: [2,8]). Conclusion The presence of an NCCL is a complicating factor in plastic surgery. The use of CTG without NCCL restoration provides better outcomes except for the reduction of dental hypersensitivity for which the combined treatment (restoration + CTG) is the most effective.","","Non-carious cervical lesions, Isolated gingival recession, Muco-gingival surgery, Systematic review, Meta-analysis","",""

Purpose To restore esthetics and masticatory function of the patient with dentinogenesis imperfecta. Methods A 24-year-old male patient had multiple caries but no occlusion on the right side. The examination revealed DMF-T 31, tulip-shaped and short/rounded radixes, shell-like chipping of enamel, which led to the diagnosis of type-II dentinogenesis imperfecta. After elimination of all decays an intraoral scanner (Trios 3, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to capture the initial surface information on both arches. The 3D-mirroring technique was performed: the tooth shapes were copied from the less-damaged surfaces on the left side to the right side, and smile design (3Shape Smile Design) was performed to reconstruct the esthetics of the fronts. Reconstructed 3D tooth surfaces were generated. All teeth were prepared and digitalized. Sectioned bite registration and digital bite acquisitions were performed. Reconstructed 3D tooth surfaces were copied onto the prepared teeth data and temporaries were 3D printed (NextDent 5100, NextDent B.V., Soesterberg, Netherlands) out from resin (NextDent C&B MFH) and cemented. After 3 months of wearing, the temporaries were rescanned intraorally, master casts were printed. Metal frameworks were sintered based on the prepared teeth scans, then porcelain layering is done on printed master casts in an adjustable articulator (PROTAREvo3, KaVo, Biberach, Germany). Results The tooth shapes and masticatory function were restored. Conclusions The digital mirroring technique, smile design, and sectional bite registration can improve the quality of complex rehabilitation.","","Dentinogenesis imperfecta, intraoral scanner, 3D printer","",""

The objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the capability of the novel dimethylaminohexadecyl-methacrylate (DMAHDM) and nano-sized amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) containing cement to reduce saliva microcosm biofilm, and (2) to investigate the long-term ion release, recharge, and re-release of DMAHDM-NACP cement. Methods Pyromellitic glycerol dimethacrylate (PMGDM) and ethoxylated bisphenol-A-dimethacrylate (EBPADMA) were used to make PEHB monomer. Five cements were fabricated: (1) PEHB+0%NACP+0%DMAHDM (experimental control); (2) PEHB+25%NACP+0%DMAHDM, (3) PEHB+25%NACP+0%DMAHDM; (4) PEHB+25%NACP+3%DMAHDM; (5) PEHB+25%NACP+5%DMAHDM. RelyX luting cement was used as commercial control. Colony-forming units (CFU), lactic acid production, metabolic activities, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were performed. Long-term Calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) ion release, recharge, and re-release were assessed. Results Compared to experimental and commercial controls, the NACP-DMAHDM cement significantly reduced CFU biofilm by 2–3 orders of magnitude, metabolic activities from 0.24±0.06 A540/cm2 to 0.03±0.01 A540/cm2, and lactic acid production from 27.7 ± 2.5 mmol/L to 5.4 ± 2.1 mmol/L (n = 6) (p<0.05). The DMAHDM showed an MIC value of 0.03 mg/L. However, when the DMAHDM was combined with PMGDM monomer, the MIC was greater than DMAHDM alone. The ion concentrations for the experimental groups significantly increased over time (1–84 days), indicating continuous ion release (n = 3) (p<0.05). Increasing the DMAHDM mass fraction from 0% to 5% and 3% to 5% significantly enhanced ion recharge and re-release at the third cycle (p<0.05). Conclusions Incorporating DMAHDM and NACP into resin-based crown cement provides strong antibacterial action against saliva microcosm biofilm and presents a high level of Ca and P ion recharge abilities, exhibiting long-term Ca and P ion release and remineralization potential. Clinical Significance Resin based cement containing NACP and DMAHDM were developed with remineralizing and potent antibacterial effects. This cement formulation showed ion release and remineralization potential and are promising formulations to inhibit the incidence of recurrent caries and could promote remineralization and be sustainable for the long term.","","Dental cement, Antibacterial, Antibiofilm, Remineralizing, Bio-interactive, Calcium phosphate nanoparticles","",""

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a direct adhesive restorative treatment on masticatory performance parameters. Materials and methods A sample of 23 fully dentate adult generalized tooth wear patients (17 male, 6 female, age 41.7 ± 8.3 years) undergoing direct composite restorative treatment was selected. Before and one month after restorative treatment with resin bonded composite restorations, masticatory performance was evaluated using 1) a comminution test, 2) a maximum voluntary bite force recording and 3) the sum score of five items related to eating and chewing from the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-49) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using a paired t-test, and analysis per OHIP item was done by a McNemar test (p < 0.05). Results There was no statistically significant difference in median particle size (X50) calculated before and after treatment (4.19 ± 0.97 and 4.03 ± 0.76, respectively, p = 0.327). Maximum voluntary bite force decreased significantly after treatment (baseline 389 ± 90 N, one month recall 323 ± 173 N, p = 0.028).

Methods and materials: Specimens were assigned to the following groups according to the adhesive protocol: G1) All-Bond Universal (ABU) self-etch (SE); G2) ABU + 0.5% BAC SE; G3) ABU + 1% methacrylate BAC SE; G4) ABU etch-and-rinse (E&R); G5) ABU + 0.5% BAC E&R; G6) ABU + 1% methacrylate BAC E&R. Gelatin zymography was performed on dentin powder obtained from eight human third molars. Endogenous enzymatic activity within the hybrid layer was examined using in situ zymography after 24 h (T0) or 1-year storage in artificial saliva (T12). Forty intact molars were prepared for microtensile bond strength test at T0 and T12. Results were statistically analyzed with three-way ANOVA (α = 0.05). Results: Gelatin zymography assay and in situ zymography quantification analyses indicated that all the BAC-containing formulations decreased matrix metalloproteinase expression. However, in situ zymography showed a general trend of enzymatic activity increase after aging. Microtensile bond-strength testing showed decrease in bond strength over time in all the tested groups; performances of the 1% methacrylate BAC experimental groups were worse than the control. Conclusions: BAC-containing adhesives reduce endogenous enzymatic activity both immediately and over time. However, independently from the adhesive employed, increase in the gelatinolytic activity over time and decrease in bond strength was found (especially in the BAC + 1% methacrylate groups), probably due to impaired polymerization properties. Clinical significance: Adhesives containing protease inhibitors are practical and efficient tools in clinical practice for enhancement of the longevity of dental restorations. However, extensive investigation of the mechanical and adhesive properties of the material is necessary prior to their clinical use.","","Benzalkonium chloride, Universal adhesives, MMPs, In situ zymography, Zymographic assay, Microtensile bond strength","",""

Materials and methods A total of 126 extracted teeth with deep dental caries were assessed using International Caries Risk and Assessment (ICDAS). Eight teeth were subsequently selected after radiographic evaluation. Each lesion was removed, leaving a thin layer of leathery dentine at the deepest part of cavity. Different cavity lining materials were placed; Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), calcium hydroxide, (Ca(OH)2), resin-based material (RBM). For each, the restorative material was an encapsulated glass ionomer (GIC) and the control group had a GIC restoration alone. Each tooth was immediately placed in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF). All samples were then imaged using XMT at baseline, and three weeks after treament. The XMT images were then subtracted to show the mineral concentration changes three weeks after treatment. Results There were significant increases in mineral concentrations within the residual demineralised dentine in individual teeth treated with Ca(OH)2, MTA, RBM, and GIC following immersion in SBF for three weeks. GIC group without any liners showed the greatest increase in mineral concentration, followed by MTA and Ca(OH)2.

Distance and exposure times were adjusted so that both LCUs delivered 5 similar levels of radiant exposures (RE) between 1.5 J/cm²–25 J/cm² in the blue wavelength range. Thus, the violet light was additional light. The top and bottom of 2-mm thick specimens were subjected to a depth-sensing indentation test (Martens hardness/HM, Vickers hardness/HV, indentation modulus/YHU, mechanical work/Wtotal, plastic deformation work/Wplas, creep/Cr). The viability of human gingival fibroblasts was assessed after three days of exposure to RBC eluates. One and multiple-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc tests (α = 0.05), t-test and a Spearman correlation analysis were used. Results As the RE increased, the mechanical properties increased at a greater rate at the top compared to the bottom of the RBCs. Values measured at the bottom of 2-mm increments approached the values measured at the top only when RE > 25 J/cm² of blue light was delivered. Toxicity decreased with RE and elution cycles and was lower for Venus Pearl. Within one RE level, addition of violet light resulted in significantly improved properties (in 131 out of 150 comparisons, p < 0.05). This effect was stronger for Venus Pearl. There was a good correlation between mechanical and biological parameters. This correlation decreased as the number of eluates increased.

Because the initiation toughness of dentine is very low, cracks initiate from incipient damage under low stress While crack toughening mechanisms exist that enable dentine to resist crack extension, these mechanisms are often inadequate for protecting dentine from crack propagation that ultimately leads to catastrophic failure. Additional factors such as ageing also reduces the resistance of dentine to crack growth. Because dentine cracks are eventually filled with bacteria biofilms upon exposure to oral fluids, they enable rapid bacteria ingress into the dental pulp via open dentinal tubules. To date, treatment options for cracked teeth are limited. While most teeth with vertical root fracture are recommended for extraction, new strategies have been reported that appeared to achieve short-term success in preserving these teeth. Clinical Significance Current strategies for the management for dentine cracks and fractures are limited and their long-term effectiveness remain uncertain. Understanding the characteristics, toughening mechanism and weakening factors of tooth cracks is helpful in designing better treatment.","","Biomechanical, Crack, Fracture toughness, Management, Vertical root fracture","",""

Materials and Methods Fifty human molars with dentine carious lesions were excavated selectively using CarisolvTM gel and then connected to simulated pulpal pressure system. Teeth were divided randomly into five groups based on the tested materials: EXP-SE, EXP-ER, a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC), a three-step adhesive system (OPT) and a universal adhesive applied in SE mode (UA-SE). The specimens were submitted to different analytical tests (μTBS, SEM fractographic analysis and dye-enhanced confocal microscopy) at baseline (T0) and after 1 year (T1). Results At T0 there was no difference in bond strength between the tested materials (p>0.05). At T1, EXP-SE and EXP-ER were the only materials to show no significant reduction in bond strength (p<0.05). The SEM showed a clear presence of minerals deposited on the dentine surface after bonding in the EXP-SE and EXP-ER groups. The specimens restored with RMGIC showed no exposure of the dentine surface after failure. The OPT and UA-SE specimens showed clear signs of degradation at the interface. Confocal microscopy imaged mineral precipitation at the interface of the EXP groups. Conclusion Conventional adhesives may have inadequate bonding performance with evident degradation at the dentine-bonded interface over time. Although the RMGIC may present a drop in bond strength after prolonged storage, the bonding interface may result less affected by degradation over time. Innovative ion-releasing adhesives may remineralise the caries-affected dentine and achieve a stable bond over time. Clinical significance GIC-based materials may represent an appropriate dentine replacement material after selective chemo-mechanical caries removal rather than conventional adhesive systems.","","Interface degradation, Selective caries removal, Caries-affected dentine, Ion-releasing adhesives, Bioglass, Phosphoproteins","",""

Data Prospective controlled (non-)randomized clinical trials investigating the efficacy of a self-assembling peptide compared to any other (placebo) treatment or untreated/standard control. Outcomes were visual analog scale (VAS), laser fluorescence, ICDAS score or morphometric measurements. Sources Three electronic databases (Central, PubMed, Ovid EMBASE) were screened. No language or time restrictions were applied.. Risk of Bias and level of evidence was graded using Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and Grade Profiler 3.6. Study selection/Results Seven studies with 508 teeth being affected in 294 patients were included. All studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT), five with a split-mouth and two with a parallel-arm design. Meta-analysis could be performed for SAP (plus fluoride varnish (FV)) vs. no treatment (plus FV) (control treatment). Depending on the outcome after up to 12 months SAP showed a significantly higher optical improvement than the control treatment (laser fluorescence: Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)[95 %CI] = −0.87[−1.39,−0.34; VAS: Mean Difference (MD)[95 %CI] = −35.38[−43.13,−27.64]) or no significant difference could be observed (ICDAS/activity score; Relative Risk (RR)[95 %CI] = 0.6[0.21,1.74]; morphometric measurements: SMD[95 %CI] = −1.95[−4.54,0.65]). Level of evidence was very low for all 4 outcomes. Furthermore, six studies showed a high risk of bias and six studies were (partially) funded by the manufactures of the tested products. Conclusion Based on a low number of clinical trials with relatively short follow up-periods and high risks of bias, self-assembling peptides may be a viable option to remineralize enamel caries. Clinical significance Self-assembling peptides may be a viable option to remineralize enamel caries. However, results should be interpretated with caution due the low number of clinical trials, the short follow-up periods and the limiting grade of evidence.","","Dental caries, Meta-analysis, Micro-invasive treatment, Review, Self-assembling peptide, White spots lesions","",""

Methods A four-stage process following EQUATOR network recommendations was followed, which included project launch, literature review, Delphi process and the tool finalization. With the support of the European Federation of Conservative Dentistry (EFCD) and the Dental Materials Group of the International Association for Dental Research (DMG-IADR), a total of 26 expert stakeholders were included in the development and Delphi vote of the initial proposal. The proposal was built using data gathered from the literature review stage. During this stage, recent systematic reviews featuring dental materials research, and risk of bias tools found in the literature were comprehensively scanned for bias sources. The experts thus reached a consensus for the items, domains and judgement related to the tool, allowing a detailed guide for each item and corresponding signalling questions. Results The tool features nine items in total, spread between 4 domains, pertaining to the following types of bias: bias related to planning and allocation (D1), specimen preparation (D2), outcome assessment (D3) and data treatment and outcome reporting (D4). RoBDEMAT, as presented, features signalling questions and a guide that can be used for RoB judgement. Its use as a checklist is preferred over a final summary score.

Methods The NACP adhesive was immersed in lactic acid at pH 4 to exhaust its calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) ion release, and then recharged with Ca and P ions. Dentin samples were pre-demineralized with 37% phosphoric acid, and then divided into four groups: (1) dentin control, (2) dentin treated with PAMAM, (3) dentin with recharged NACP adhesive, (4) dentin with PAMAM + recharged NACP adhesive. In group (2) and (4), the PAMAM-coated dentin was immersed in phosphate-buffered saline with vigorous shaking for 77 days to accelerate any detachment of the PAMAM macromolecules from the demineralized dentin. Samples were treated with a cyclic remineralization/demineralization regimen for 21 days. Results After 77 days of fluid flow challenge, the immersed PAMAM still retained its nucleation template function. The recharged NACP adhesive possessed sustained ion re-release and acid-neutralization capability, both of which did not decrease with repeated recharge and re-release cycles. The immersed PAMAM with the recharged NACP adhesive achieved long-term dentin remineralization, and restored dentin hardness to that of healthy dentin. Conclusions The PAMAM + NACP adhesive completely remineralizes pre-demineralized dentin even after long-term fluid challenges and provides long-term remineralization to protect tooth structures.

Methods Eight intrabony periodontal defects were enrolled in the present investigation. CBCT and intraoral scans (IOS) were taken prior to and 6 months after periodontal regenerative surgery. Utilizing a semi-automatic segmentation method 3D models were generated from CBCT scans using an open-source radiographic image processing software (3D Slicer). Hybrid models were acquired with the superimposition and subsequent free-form surface modeling of the segmented CBCT model and the IOS. Hybrid models visualizing all relevant anatomical structures separately (alveolar bone, teeth, soft tissues) were used to plan each step of the procedure virtually prior to surgery.  Superimposition of the pre- and post-operative CBCT scans was performed to validate volumetric and 3D morphological alterations.

Confusion exists in the literature in terms of the indication and rationale for each VPT approach. The objectives of the present study are to elucidate the indications for VPT and to present a set of histopathology and histobacteriology-based guidelines for VPT in teeth with deep caries. Methods Two hundred and sixty-four carious, unrestored and VPT-treated human teeth, which were extracted for reasons not related to the present study. The teeth were processed for histological and histobacteriological examination. Other 757 clinical cases that received different VPT procedures were followed-up to identify success rates, with the longest observational period of 30 years. Results Follow-up of the clinical cases indicated that direct pulp capping was successful in 73.2%, partial pulpotomy in 96.4% and full pulpotomy in 77.8% of the cases. Histological and histobacteriological examination showed a localised inflammatory response that commonly occurred in the subjacent pulp tissue as soon as the enamel was penetrated by caries. If the softened and infected dentine were completely excavated, without pulp exposure, and the cavity restored with an adequate restoration, pulp inflammation frequently subsided. In teeth showing pulp exposure, the extent of bacterial penetration varied and areas of infection presented severe pulp inflammation, including micro-abscesses. However, the pulp tissue apical to the infected/inflamed area was usually uninflamed and normal. Guidelines based on the present histopathological, histobacteriological and clinical findings are proposed for VPT and mainly involve direct examination of dentine and the exposed pulp tissue under deep caries for decision-making, and require strict asepsis during procedures. Conclusions Vital pulp therapy following the guidelines proposed in the present article has the potential to improve the outcome of the conservative treatment of mature teeth with deep caries and in some occasions may be an alternative to pulpectomy. Clinical Significance A guideline for VPT in the treatment of deep caries is proposed, focusing on direct observation of dentine and the exposed pulp tissue under deep caries.

During remineralization mineral is deposited on the outside of the lesion creating a highly mineralized surface layer that inhibits diffusion, arrests the lesion and prevents shrinkage. Previous studies suggest that active root caries lesions manifest shrinkage, while arrested lesions no longer manifest shrinkage upon dehydration. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the shrinkage of root caries lesions can be monitored during dehydration using an optical coherence tomography probe suitable for clinical use. Methods In this in vitro study the shrinkage of simulated and natural root caries lesions on extracted teeth was measured using a cross polarization optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT) system and a 3D printed appliance with an integrated air nozzle suitable for clinical use. Two methods were employed to assess shrinkage, changes in the position of the lesion surface and changes in the thickness of the lesion. Results CP-OCT was successful in measuring a significant (P < 0.05) contraction of the lesion surface, significant decrease in the lesion thickness and increase in the reflectivity per micron upon drying natural lesions on extracted teeth. Conclusions In this preclinical study, we have demonstrated that a CP-OCT handpiece modified for infection control with an attached air nozzle suitable for in vivo use can be used to monitor the shrinkage of root caries lesions. In addition, we have developed a new approach to measuring lesion shrinkage with OCT, namely monitoring changes in the lesion thickness as opposed to the position of the lesion surface, that does not require an initial reference position and is more easily implemented in vivo.","","Optical coherence tomography, Root caries, Shrinkage, Lesion activity","",""

Results Tooth appearance at the 3-year follow-up revealed a difference amongst CI, FI and PS implants (p=0.049; Kruskal-Wallis test). PS was rated better than FI (p=0.047) at 1 year for appearance of soft-tissue and satisfaction with colour. There were no differences for self-consciousness, smile and pain/discomfort while eating/hard food items. Conclusions Although participants tended to rate the health of mucosa around PS implants as slighty better than the other two implant systems, the differences were minimal and inconsistent. Thus, patient satisfaction in terms self-perceived gingival health and esthetics was high for all 3 systems tested, suggesting that patients are unable to detect mucosal inflammation. Clinical Significance Patients find it difficult to perceive mucosal inflammation; hence, it is recommended that patients attend implant follow-up visits, even if they do not perceive inflammation. The study suggests that there is a relationship between the PROs and the clinical outcomes of tested implants.","","Implant-abutment interface, Esthetics, Patient-reported outcomes, Peri-implant mucosa","",""

Additionally, the treatment of a complex lateral incisor is presented to illustrate the use of sleeveless guides in a clinical situation. Methods Two cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) volumes of an upper and lower jaw were selected to design 3D printed models with PCO. Virtual planning of the access cavities was performed from right to left second premolar. Then, the models were mounted into a phantom head to simulate an actual patient. Two operators with different levels of experience in endodontics performed guided access cavities. The handpiece was guided by guiding rails placed against each other on the sides of the tooth. A post-operative CBCT scan was taken for analysis. Results Eighty-eight guided access cavities (44 per operator) were drilled on eight 3D printed models. The mean length of the access cavities was 15.3 mm, with a mean coronal and apical deviation of 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm respectively. The mean angular deviation was 1.5°. No statistically significant difference was found between operators for the three measured parameters. Conclusions This study demonstrates, within its limitations, that sleveless guides represent an accurate method for guided endodontic treatment. No statistically significant difference between operators was found when using the guide. Clinical significance This method offers a valuable alternative to conventional endodontic guides with similar accuracy results.","","3-Dimensional printing, Accuracy, Cone beam computed tomography, Dental pulp calcification, Guided endodontics","",""

Plaque biofilms were grown on the surfaces of restorative material discs for 1 week. The surface roughness and biofilm attachment were assessed by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. One-week-old biofilms grown anaerobically at 37 °C were exposed to each of five solutions for one minute (twice daily for seven days): Listerine Total care and Paroex Gum mouthrinses, 0.12% chlorhexidine, 0.001% d-enantiomeric peptide DJK-5, and sterile water. The dynamic variation of the biovolume of the biofilms and the percentage of dead bacteria were monitored and analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results All restorative materials had similar surface roughness with intact biofilm attachment. The percentage of dead bacteria and biovolume of biofilms treated by each oral rinse solution remained constant between days 1 and 7, with no statistically significant difference. DJK-5 showed the highest percentage of dead bacteria (up to 75.7%; cf. ∼20–40% for other mouthrinses) of all solutions tested within 7 days. Conclusions DJK-5 outperformed conventional mouthrinses in killing bacteria in oral multispecies biofilms grown on dental restorative materials.

The papers were selected by 3 independent calibrated reviewers. Study selection The search strategy produced 937 records. After the removal of duplicates and the exclusion of papers that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 71 papers were included. Conclusions After reviewing the included records, it was found that two types of ZLS (Vita Suprinity PC; Vita Zahnfabrik and Celtra Duo; Dentsply Sirona) are nowadays available on the market for CAD/CAM systems, similar in their chemical composition, microstructure, and biological-mechanical properties. ZLS is reported to be a biocompatible material, whose fracture resistance can withstand physiological chewing loads. The firing process influences the improvements of strength and fatigue failure load, with a volumetric shrinkage. To date, ZLS can be considered a viable alternative to other glass-ceramics for fixed single restorations. Clinical Significance . As to biocompatibility and mechanical properties of ZLS, data are still scarce, often controversial and limited to short-term observational periods. These promising ceramics require further in vitro/in vivo studies to accurately define mechanical and biological properties, mainly in the long-term performance of restorations produced with such materials.","","ZLS, Zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate, Dental materials, Ceramics, Zirconia, CAD-CAM","",""

Materials and methods The study sample included 34 patients presenting 34 premolars in need of prosthetic rehabilitation: a total of 68 temporary crowns were manufactured, 34 of which milled and 34 printed. Immediately after manufacturing, the milled and printed provisionals were scanned with a desktop scanner (E1, 3Shape) to obtain STL files, that were superimposed to the original CAD design in order to identify the occlusal trueness (Analysis A). A second occlusal comparison was performed by scanning both kind of provisional after being placed intraorally with Trios scanner (3 Shape); intraoral scans were obtained in order to compare STL files of provisionals before and after occlusal adjustments (Analysis B).  The occlusal trueness was identified at three reference points, P1 (vestibular cusp), P2 (palatal / lingual cusp), P3 (central fossa). The statistical analysis was performed using the R 3.4.3 statistical software (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing), with a significance level of p <0.05. Results Overall, the printed crowns showed lower occlusal differences than the milled crowns, when compared to the CAD design file, with a statistically significant difference in P1 (difference of 0.025 ± 0.046 mm), P2 (difference of 0.027 ± 0 0.044 mm) and P3 ( difference of 0.018 ± 0.050) for Analysis A (p <0.05). In the Analysis B the direct comparison between the degree of average difference between the pre-adjustment and the post-occlusal adjustment of the milled and printed crowns shows that the printed crowns have lower occlusal mean difference values in all three points compared to the milled ones (difference of 0.146 ± 0.273 mm in P1, 0.285 ± 0.360 mm in P2 and 0.257 ± 0.277 mm in P3). Conclusions Within the limitation of this study, the data obtained showed a better occlusal surface dimensional accuracy of the 3D printed provisional crowns, when compared to the milled ones. Comparing the results obtained, it is possible to assume that the intraoral scans also had a contribution to occlusion, beside the manufacturing method. 3D printing can be successfully applied for manufacturing temporary PMMA crowns.","","Occlusal precision, 3D printing, CAD-CAM, Digital dentistry","",""

Material and methods Four hundred and eighty human molars were distributed into 60 groups according to dentine substrate (sound dentine [SD], eroded with soft drink, or eroded with citric acid), application method of the adhesive (SE or ER), and the adhesives used: 1. All-Bond Universal, 2. Ambar Universal, 3. Clearfil Universal, 4. Futurabond U, 5. One Coat 7 Universal, 6. Peak Universal Bond, 7. Prime&Bond Elect, 8. Scotchbond Universal, 9. Tetric n-bond Universal, and 10. Xeno Select. The restoration was then performed with a composite resin, and the specimens were sectioned into resin-dentine bonded sticks. The sticks were tested (immediately or after 6 years of storage) for µTBS (0.5 mm/min) or used to assess NL. The eroded dentine surfaces were also examined using FE-SEM to evaluate the NL. Data for µTBS were analyzed by four-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test (a = 0.05), and the NL was analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis and the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Sum test (a = 0.05). Results In ED, there was no difference in μTBS and NL between ER and SE strategies (p > 0.05). Most μTBS and NL values obtained for ED were lower and higher, respectively, than those for SD (p < 0.005). Additionally, the worst results (μTBS and NL) were observed for erosion with citric acid groups in comparison with erosion with soft-drink groups (p < 0.007). After 6y, μTBS was generally lower and NL higher for all substrates, adhesives, and strategies (p < 0.05), except for AMB, SBU, and TEU in dentine eroded with citric acid. The lowest μTBS and highest NL values were observed for ABU, FBU, OCU, PUB, PBE, and XEN in both types of eroded dentine and evaluation times (p < 0.002). Conclusion: The use of MDP-containing adhesives seems to be essential to maintain adhesion to eroded dentine. However, other factors such as acidity should be considered.

Methods Amalgam was placed into 140 hydroxyapatite disks and matured for 14-days in artificial saliva. The solution was replaced, and samples split into five groups of 28 immediately prior to MRI. One group had no exposure, and the remainder were exposed to either a 3T or 7T MRI scanner, each at high and low RF power. Mercury concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Groups were compared using one-way ANOVA, and two-way ANOVA for main effects/ interaction of field strength/ RF power. Results Mercury concentration was increased in the 7T groups (high/ low: 15.43/ 11.33 ng mL−1) and 3T high group (3.59) compared to control (2.44). MRI field strength significantly increased mercury release (p < .001) as did RF power (p = .030). At 3T, mercury release was 20.3 times lower than during maturation of dental amalgam, and for the average person an estimated 1.50 ng kg−1 of mercury might be released during one 3T investigation; this is substantially lower than the tolerable weekly intake of 4,000 ng kg−1. Conclusion Mercury release from amalgam shows a measurable increase following MRI, and the magnitude changes with magnetic field strength and RF power. The amount of mercury released is small compared to release during amalgam maturation. Amalgam mercury release during MRI is unlikely to be clinically meaningful and highly likely to remain below safe levels.","","Magnetic resonance imaging, Dental amalgam, Mercury, Dental materials, Mass spectrometry, Humans, Saliva","",""

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the quantitative data. Pearson's Chi-Square test or Fisher's Exact test was applied to categorical variables while Kruskal-Wallis or Spearman's correlation coefficient was applied to continuous variables (p <0.05).

Additionally, the movement of the adjacent teeth was determined. Materials and methods Intraoral scans of the occlusal surfaces of 41 patients were performed after insertion of the implant restoration (baseline), after 12 and 24 months. From the initial study cohort, eleven implant crown/enamel antagonist pairs with adjacent enamel antagonist pairs could be analyzed in nine patients after 12 months. After 24 months, ten implant crowns of eight patients were available due to one decementation of an implant crown. A semiautomatic specifically developed iterative closest point algorithm was used to superimpose the surfaces of the baseline scan with the follow-up scans to measure the maximum height loss of each identified wear side. The mean maximum tooth wear and the standard deviation (SD) were calculated per unit. The ratio of wear of enamel/enamel antagonist teeth and the wear ratio of adjacent lithium disilicate implant crowns and their enamel antagonist surfaces were evaluated. Tooth movements were described by translations and rotations using a separate measurement procedure. The surfaces of the scans were superimposed setting the implant as a reference structure for registration. Results After 12 months the wear ratio between the enamel antagonist pairs was 0.95 ± 0.27 µm and the ratio between lithium disilicate/enamel was 0.73 ± 0.49 µm.

This study evaluated the effect of barriers when applied correctly and incorrectly on the radiant power (mW), irradiance (mW/cm2), emission spectrum (mW/nm), and beam profile from a multi-peak light-curing unit (LCU). Methods Five plastic barriers (VALO Grand, Ultradent; TIDIShield, TIDI Products; Disposa-Shield, Dentsply Sirona; Cure Sleeve, Kerr; Stretch and Seal, Betty Crocker) and one latex-based barrier (Curelastic, Steri-Shield) were tested. The radiant power (mW) and emission spectrum (mW/nm) from one multi-peak LCU (VALO Grand, Ultradent) was measured using an integrating sphere. LCU tip internal diameter (mm) was measured, then the tip area and irradiance (mW/cm2) were calculated. The beam profiles were measured using a laser beam profiler. Results When applied correctly, the plastic barriers reduced the radiant power output by 5–8%, and the latex-based barrier by 16%. When the plastic seam or barrier opaque face was positioned over the LCU tip, the power output was reduced by 8–11%. When the plastic barriers were wrinkled, the power output was significantly reduced by 14–26%. The wrinkled latex-based barrier reduced by 28%, and further reduced the violet light. The beam profiles illustrated the importance of correctly barrier use without wrinkles over the tip. Conclusions Plastic barriers applied correctly reduced the light output (mW) by 5–8%. The barriers applied incorrectly significantly reduced the light output by 14–26%. The latex-based barrier wrinkled also reduced the amount of violet light.

All groups resulted in a significantly worse marginal adaptation and marginal staining for the FDI criteria when the baseline vs. the 24 m recall data were compared. These differences were considered clinically acceptable under the FDI criteria. Conclusions The application of PA as a primer did not result in clinical advantages after 24 m of clinical service, regardless of the concentration used. Clinical Relevance It has been reported that PA, a collagen crosslinking agent, increases the durability of the dentin-resin interface. However, no effects were found clinically after 24 months.","","Dentin-bonding agents, Non-carious cervical lesions, Proanthocyanidins, Clinical study","",""

Methods 35 participants were classified into two groups according to the retention system of their metal-ceramic i-FDPs. For the analysis of peri-implant health and prosthetic complications, the implant units were individually assessed. Group 1 (SPD; n = 22): implant units for screwed i-FDPs; and Group 2 (CPD; n = 36): implant units for cemented i-FDPs. Data related to socio-demographics, design and installation of the superstructures, peri-implant condition, prosthetic complications, functionality, and aesthetics, were gathered. Patients answered the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14sp) questionnaire. Descriptive and parametric probes were run to evaluate the impact scores considering the study variables (α = 0.05). Results The plaque index, gingival index, functionality, aesthetics, and global evaluation made by the patient recorded significantly better results for the SPD group. The most affected OHIP-14sp domain was ‘Physical pain’, followed by ‘Psychological discomfort’, and ‘Functional limitation’. The subscales: ‘Functional limitation’, ‘Physical disability’, and ‘Social disability’, attributed significantly worst OHRQoL to CPD users. Conclusion A major presence of peri-implant disease, together with a worse functionality, aesthetics, and patient satisfaction were recorded in cemented i-FDPs with respect to the screwed ones. Clinical significance The retention system of i-FDPs can impact the peri-implant health, the subjective functional and aesthetic evaluation of the restoration, and the patients’ OHRQoL; the screw retention providing superior results than the cementation.","","Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), Oral health impact profile (OHIP), Peri-implant health, Implant fixed dental prostheses (i-FDPs), Screwed implant-supported partial prostheses, Cemented implant-supported partial prostheses","",""

Near-infrared-light-transillumination (NILT) could be used to support school-based screening and to identify early proximal caries, facilitating referral and appropriate non- or micro-invasive management in dental practice. Method We assessed the cost-effectiveness of NILT for school-based caries screening. A German mixed-payers’ perspective was adopted. A Markov model was used to simulate the consequences of true and false positive and negative detections and the subsequent decisions over the lifetime of initially 12 years old patients. Our health outcome was tooth retention in years. Costs were measured in Euro 2020. Monte-Carlo-microsimulations, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost-effectiveness-acceptability at different willingness-to-pay-thresholds were quantified. Results NILT was minimally more effective (tooth retention for a mean (2.5–97.5%) 56 (53–59) years) and minimally less costly (515 (416–616) Euro) than standard of care (56 (50–59) years; 526 (427–628 Euro)). The ICER was -503 Euro/year, i.e. school-based caries screening using NILT saved money at higher effectiveness in the modelled population. The cost-effectiveness of NILT increased for payers with a willingness-to-pay for additional tooth retention time. The biggest driver of costs were (avoided) tooth replacements later in life. Conclusions NILT-based screening is likely to yield limited effectiveness gains and cost savings in the modelled populations. In countries where regular practice-based screening of children is less common than in Germany, the cost-effectiveness of NILT for school-based caries screening is likely higher. Clinical significance NILT-based caries screening in German schools is unlikely to be cost-effective. In countries with different utilization patterns or generally higher caries prevalence and risk, this may differ.","","Caries, Caries detection/diagnosis/prevention, Computer simulation, Dental, Decision-making, Economic evaluation, Radiology","",""

Materials and methods The restorative materials utilized in this study included: 1. Filtek Z250, 2. Fuji II LC, 3. Beautifil II, 4. ACTIVA, and 5. Biodentine. For each material, disc-shaped specimens were prepared. The inhibitory effects against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Leptotrichia shahii were tested. After incubation for 24 h and 1 week, colony-forming units (CFUs) were enumerated. From the plates dedicated for biomass quantification and RNA purification, the target glucosyltransferase B (gtfB) and glucan-binding protein B (gbpB) genes were chosen for S. mutans. For L. acidophilus, a gene involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis (epsB) was chosen. Results Except for Filtek Z250, all four materials showed statistically significant inhibitory effects on the biofilms of all three species. When biofilms were grown in the presence of the same four materials, the expression of S. mutans gtfB and gbpB genes, was significantly reduced. For L. acidophilus, the decrease in the expression of gtfB gene in the presence of ACTIVA was the highest change seen. The epsB gene expression also decreased. Compared to fluoride-releasing materials, bioactive materials had more inhibitory effect against L. acidophilus, both at 24 h and 1 week. Conclusions Both fluoride releasing and bioactive materials exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the biofilm growth. The expression of the targeted biofilm-associated genes was downregulated by both material groups. Clinical significance The findings from this study give insight into the antibacterial effect of fluoride-containing and bioactive materials which would help to reduce the chances for secondary caries and therefore increase the lifetime of dental restorations placed for patients.","","Fluoride, Bioactive, Resin, Caries, Streptococcus mutans, Antibacterial","",""

This study assessed the survival and maintenance efforts of adhesively attached extracted tooth crowns (‘immediate pontics’; IPs). Methods Patients receiving active and supportive periodontal treatment involving IPs in a university setting were retrospectively assessed. Survival and repairs of IPs were recorded. Multilevel Cox and linear regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with survival and maintenance efforts. Results Twenty-seven patients (male/female: 12/15) with 34 IPs (maxilla/mandible: 13/21) were followed over mean ± SD 8.0 ± 5.0 [range: 2.0–19.3] years. At baseline 85.2% suffered from periodontitis stage II or III and 59.3% showed rapid progression (grade C). The mean (95% CI) survival time of splinting was 5.3 ± 3.8 [range: 0.1–18.0] years. Three IPs had been removed without any significant association with patient- or tooth-level factors. 35.3% of the IPs (n = 12) required a repair, with a mean of 0.5 ± 0.9 [0–3] repairs per IP (annual: 0.1 ± 0.2 [0–0.5]). The risk of repairs significantly increased with patients’ age (p = 0.018). Conclusion IPs showed moderate survival. However, to maintain IPs, frequent repairs were needed. Clinical significance Immediately and adhesively attached crowns of extracted teeth in periodontitis patients seems like a valid, albeit temporary strategy which may allow to postpone more comprehensive prosthetic treatment if required, for example during active periodontal therapy. However, to maintain immediate pontics, frequent repairs were needed.","","Splinting, Fibre-reinforced-composite splint, Tooth loss, Periodontal therapy","",""
