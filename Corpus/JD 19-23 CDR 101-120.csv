Methods Two ion-releasing RBCs, Activa (ACT) and Cention-N (CN), were compared to a conventional RBC (Z350) and a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji-II-LC). Ten disk-shaped specimens were fabricated for each material (n = 40). After standardized surface polishing procedure, the surface properties of the specimens were evaluated using surface roughness measurements by a profilometer and hydrophobicity using water contact angle measurements. To assess bacterial adhesion, the number of S. mutans bacteria was calculated from colony-forming units (CFU). Confocal laser scanning microscope analysis was done for qualitative & quantitative assessment. The data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test to compare the mean values of surface roughness, water contact angle and CFU values. To compare the mean dead cell percentage Kruskal-Wallis rank test and Conover test were used. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was used to report the statistical significance. Results Z350 and ACT had the smoothest surfaces, followed by CN, and the roughest surface was seen in FUJI-II-LC. The lowest water contact angles were seen in CN, and Z350, and the highest were in ACT. S. mutans counts were the highest in ACT and the lowest in Z350 and CN. CN and Fuji-II-LC registered the highest percentage of dead bacterial cells, while the lowest were in ACT. Significance Surface properties did not significantly influence bacterial adhesion. More S. mutans bacteria accumulated on ACT than on the nanofilled composite and on CN. CN had antibacterial effects against Streptococcus mutans biofilms.","","Resin composites, Ion release, Surface properties, , Confocal laser scanning microscopy","",""

The generated CAD was used to mill CAISFP frameworks in Ti, PEEK, or PEKK (each n = 10). The frameworks were digitized with an industrial light scanner to superimpose resulting standard tessellation language (STL) file with the CAD file. Deviations at five points at the abutment-framework interface of each of the four abutment sites (1:left first molar, 2:left canine, 3:right canine, 4:right first molar sites) were calculated (trueness). Marginal gaps were measured using the triple scan technique. A nonparametric repeated measures ANOVA by Brunner and Puri with factors being abutment location and material was performed to assess the mean deviations for trueness and mean marginal gaps, followed by Mann-Whitney or exact Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests (alpha=.05). Results Material type significantly affected the trueness (p<0.0001). PEEK had the lowest deviations (0.039 +/-0.01mm) followed by PEKK (0,049 +/-0.009mm), and Ti (0.074 +/-0.011mm). For marginal gaps, only abutment location's effect was significant (p = 0.003). Within PEKK, gaps at abutment 4 were significantly larger, compared with abutments 2 (p = 0.04) and 3 (p = 0.02). Conclusions The trueness of PEEK, PEKK, and Ti frameworks was different after milled. PEEK had the highest trueness. However, the marginal fit of the frameworks was similar and smaller than 90 µm in average. Clinical Relevance PEEK, PEKK, and Ti complete-arch frameworks had clinically acceptable gaps and may therefore be recommended when their fit is considered.

Additionally, the treatment of a complex lateral incisor is presented to illustrate the use of sleeveless guides in a clinical situation. Methods Two cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) volumes of an upper and lower jaw were selected to design 3D printed models with PCO. Virtual planning of the access cavities was performed from right to left second premolar. Then, the models were mounted into a phantom head to simulate an actual patient. Two operators with different levels of experience in endodontics performed guided access cavities. The handpiece was guided by guiding rails placed against each other on the sides of the tooth. A post-operative CBCT scan was taken for analysis. Results Eighty-eight guided access cavities (44 per operator) were drilled on eight 3D printed models. The mean length of the access cavities was 15.3 mm, with a mean coronal and apical deviation of 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm respectively. The mean angular deviation was 1.5°. No statistically significant difference was found between operators for the three measured parameters. Conclusions This study demonstrates, within its limitations, that sleveless guides represent an accurate method for guided endodontic treatment. No statistically significant difference between operators was found when using the guide.

Methods A model of a maxilla with a prepared premolar was scanned with an industrial scanner (ATOSQ®, Gom) and an MZC was designed in computer-assisted-design (CAD) software (DentalCad®, Exocad). From that standard tessellation language (STL) file, 10 MZCs (test) were 3D-printed with a Lithography-based Ceramic Manufacturing (LCM) printer (CerafabS65®, Lithoz) and 10 MZCs (control) were milled using a 5-axis machine (DWX-52D®, DGShape).

Finally, the clinical precision (marginal adaptation, interproximal contacts) of test and control MZCs was investigated on a split-cast model printed (Solflex350®, Voco) from the CAD project, and compared. Results The milled MZCs had a significantly higher trueness than the 3D-printed ones, overall [(90-10)/2 printed 37.8 µm vs milled 21.2 µm; ABS AVG printed 27.2 µm vs milled 15.1 µm; RMS printed 33.2 µm vs milled 20.5 µm; p = 0.000005], at the margins [(90-10)/2 printed 25.6 µm vs milled 12.4 µm; ABS AVG printed 17.8 µm vs milled 9.4 µm; RMS printed 22.8 µm vs milled 15.6 µm; p= 0.000011] and at the occlusal level [(90-10)/2 printed 50.4 µm vs milled 21.9 µm; ABS AVG printed 29.6 µm vs milled 14.7 µm; RMS printed 38.9 µm vs milled 22.5 µm; p = 0.000005].

Methods CNC/ZnO nanohybrids were prepared through precipitating Zn2+ on the surface of CNC and then introduced into the DRCs. The mechanical properties of DRCs including compressive strength, flexural modulus, flexural strength, and Vickers microhardness were characterized. The antibacterial activity of DRCs to Streptococcus mutans was determined and the morphology of Streptococcus mutans on the surface of DRCs after incubation was observed. The morphology of fractured surface after flexural test and Zn content in DRCs were analyzed. Results Compared with DRCs without CNC/ZnO nanohybrids, DRCs containing 2 wt.% CNC/ZnO nanohybrids possess higher compressive strength and flexural modulus and there is no significantly statistical difference (P＞0.05) on the flexural strength and Vickers microhardness. The excess use of CNC/ZnO nanohybrids decreases the mechanical properties of DRCs except flexural modulus.

Methods Experimental composites were prepared with 0, 10, or 20 wt% of either BG 45S5 or a customized low-Na F-containing BG. Three commercial ion-releasing materials were used for reference. Material specimens were immersed in lactic acid (pH = 4.0) and artificial saliva (pH = 6.4). Ion concentrations (atomic absorption spectrometry for Ca, UV–vis spectrometry for PO4, and ion-selective electrode for F) and pH were measured after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 days. After immersion, composite specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Results Material-dependent concentrations of Ca, PO4, and F were measured in the lactic acid solution, while a decrease of Ca and PO4 concentrations was observed in artificial saliva. The uptake of ions from artificial saliva indicates their precipitation on specimen surfaces, which was supported by the results of SEM and FTIR investigations. In experimental composites functionalized with both bioactive glass types and a commercial “alkasite” material, apatite was precipitated not only in artificial saliva but also in the lactic acid solution. Conclusions Experimental BG-containing composites and selected commercial restorative materials demonstrated the potential for releasing multiple ion types and increasing pH.

We calculated the costs of prosthetic rehabilitation and analyzed whether costs of treatment begun in early adolescence are lower compared with in early adulthood. Methods : Data from the dental records of 25 patients with AI and 25 age- and sex-matched controls were analyzed. Patients were followed for a mean period of 12.3 ± 1.5 years. Number of dental visits, dental treatment costs, and indirect costs were calculated during three time periods, before, during and after prosthetic therapy.

Their antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis in direct contact was assessed by scanning electron microscopy and live-dead staining using confocal microscopy over a period of eight weeks. The materials’ structural integrity was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Results The antimicrobial activity of the materials varied. The metal alloy posts as well as BioRoot RCS sealer did not allow any biofilm accumulation; but gutta-percha, Pulp Canal Sealer and resin from fibre-reinforced posts encouraged thick biofilm accumulation. Microstructural changes were observed in AH Plus (washout) and BioRoot (crystal deposition) in contact with biofilm. The Pulp Canal and BioRoot RCS sealers exhibited a modified ion leaching pattern in contact with microbially loaded media. Conclusions The microbial challenge affected the material microstructure in some of the materials tested and allowed biofilm accumulation.

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short implants and standard implants in the same study after an observation period of at least five years were included. Data Nine RCTs were included in this study. The survival rates of short implants (<7 mm) ranged from 86.7 %–98.5 %, whereas the survival rates of longer implants (≥7 mm) were 95.1%–100% with follow‐up ranging from 5 to 10 years. Dichotomous variables were compared using the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method, and continuous variables were compared using the inverse variance (IV) method. The random effects model and the fixed effects model were used. Meta-analyses showed that short implants had a poorer survival rate than longer implants (P = 0.008).

The biological complications of short implants were lower (P < 0.001) and the technical complications were higher, than those of long implants (P = 0.006). Conclusions The results indicate that although the survival rate of short implants in the maxilla may be lower than that of long implants, the survival rate of short implants in the mandible is similar to that of long implants, and short implants can result in a lower rate of biological complications. The conclusions should be interpreted with caution due to the limited numbers of participants and implants.

High success rates have been reported for the use of pulpotomy in managing pulp exposure resulting from extensive caries. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pulpotomy and associated medicaments in saving permanent teeth with pulp exposure resulting from extensive caries. Sources Multiple databases were searched on January 12, 2019, without limitations on the language or year of publication. Study selection Randomized controlled trials comparing pulpotomy with alternative treatments, or comparing two or more medicaments in pulpotomy for permanent teeth with carious pulp exposure were included. Data Seventeen studies reported in 21 articles were included. Intention-to-treat analyses on studies comparing pulpotomy and other treatment modalities tended to favor pulpotomy. Meta-analysis was not performed on comparisons of pulpotomy and other treatments because of the limited number of studies. Most evidence on comparisons among different pulpotomy medicaments was found in trials comparing mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and calcium hydroxide, with the results of meta-analyses favoring MTA. Data were insufficient to determine the cost-effectiveness of successful modality. Conclusions Pulpotomy is a prospective substitute for root canal treatment in managing permanent teeth with carious pulp exposures, even in permanent teeth with irreversible pulpitis. Large, well-designed trials comparing pulpotomy with other treatments in terms of cost-effectiveness should be informative. Clinical significance The success of pulpotomy in managing irreversible pulpitis challenges the rhetoric that irreversible pulpitis can only be managed by root canal treatment. Cost-effectiveness analysis rather than analysis on effectiveness of treatment outcome alone should be considered in all health care domains to evaluate the benefits of alternative treatment options.","","Cost-benefit analysis, Dental caries, Meta-analysis, Pulpotomy, Pulpitis, Systematic review","",""

Different material types with varying flexural strength and modulus of elasticity were compared with screw-retained or bonded application. Materials and methods Identical anterior FDPs (tooth 11–13; n = 80) from materials (flexural strength 240−1150 MPa, modulus 7.6−210 GPa; 1x lithiumdisilicate ceramic, 2x zirconia (4Y-TZP, 5Y-FSZ), 3x resin-based composites (with different flexural strength and modulus)) were milled. FDPs were grouped into chairside (bonded) and labside (screw-retained) procedure. To simulate a 5-year clinical application, thermal cycling with mechanical loading (TCML) was accomplished. TCML-performance and fracture force were evaluated and failure patterns were analysed. Data were statistically investigated (Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test, one-way-ANOVA; post-hoc-Bonferroni, α = 0.05). Results TCML did not lead to any cracks, fractures or chipping on all tested FDPs. Fracture values varied between 1208.9 ± 354.6 N (experimental resin-based composite) and 2094.3 ± 293.4 N (4Y-TZP) for FDPs without screw channel. With screw channel the results ranged between 1297.9 ± 268.3 N (5Y-FSZ) and 2129.3 ± 321.7 N (4Y-TZP). The influence of the screw channel was not significant for all materials (p ≥ 0.218). Modulus of elasticity and flexural strength had influence on the fracture force only in the individual material groups. Fractures at the connector were predominant for ceramic and zirconia. Resin-based composites primarily showed radial fractures in abutment region or mixed failure types. FDPs with/without screw-channel showed comparable types of failure. Conclusions TCML did not lead to drop-outs or failures for all FDPs. Individual materials showed no different in-vitro performance, but varying fracture force after TCML. Independent from material, screw channels did not weaken the FDPs. All tested systems showed sufficient properties for an anterior implant application.","","CAD/CAM, Zirconia, Lithiumdisilicate, TCML, Implant, Composite","",""

Methods Systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement (PRISMA) statement. Data/sources MEDLINE via Ovid, Scopus, PsycINFO via Ovid, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and clinicaltrials.gov were searched (Jan 1980 to Nov 2018) using high-level MeSH terms for studies published in English, investigating OHRQoL, using valid indices. Risk of bias (RoB) Determined using Cochrane RoB tool and ROBINS-I. Evidence certainty Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group tool. Results Study Selection: 280 articles were identified; 270 were excluded after abstract review, 7 after examining full text, leaving 3 articles (3 studies, 188 participants, 172 analysed) included in this review; one RCT and two observational studies. Synthesis of results: There was significant heterogeneity and no meta-analysis was possible. Description of effect: One pre-post study design found provision of 2-unit RRBs significantly reduced the total OHIP-49 score (effect size 0.67), compared with an untreated control. One case-control study found no differences in total OHIP-49 between individuals treated with RRB or implant-supported crown. Major complications related to a worse OHRQoL. Discussion Quality of evidence: The overall RoB assessments were one study “some concerns” and two studies “serious”. The GRADE assessment was “moderate” for one comparison and “low” for two comparisons. Clinical significance: A 2-unit cantilever RRB to replace one missing tooth probably results in a large improvement in oral health-related quality of life. Clinicians should ensure that the correct investigations and design of prosthesis are prescribed to help reduce any failures that may impact on OHRQoL.","","Quality of life, Oral health-related quality of life, Resin-retained bridge, Tooth replacement, Adhesive bridge","",""

Methods The NACP adhesive was immersed in a pH 4 solution to exhaust calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) ions and then recharged with Ca and P ions. Dentin samples were demineralized underStreptococcus mutans biofilms for 24 h and randomly divided into two groups: (1) dentin control, (2) dentin with recharged NACP adhesives. Each day, all the samples were immersed in brain heart infusion broth with 1% sucrose (BHIS) for 4 h, and then in artificial saliva (AS) for 20 h. This cycle was repeated for 10 days. The pH of BHIS, the Ca and P ions content of the BHIS and AS were measured daily. After 10 days, the lactic acid production and colony-forming units of the biofilms were tested. The changes of remineralization/demineralization were also analyzed. Results Dentin in the control group showed further demineralization. The recharged NACP adhesive neutralized acids, increasing the pH to above 5, and released large amounts of Ca and P ions each day. The recharged NACP adhesive decreased the production of lactic acid (P < 0.05), inhibited dentin demineralization and sustained the dentin hardness in the biofilm-challenged environment, showing an excellent long-term demineralization-inhibition capability. Conclusions The NACP adhesive could continuously inhibit dentin demineralization in a biofilm-challenged environment by recharging with Ca and P ions. Significance The rechargeable NACP adhesive could provide long-term dentin bond protection.","","Calcium phosphate nanoparticles, TMR, Dental adhesive, Caries inhibition, Rechargeable, Biofilm-challenged environment","",""

Methodology 150 blocks (6 × 5 × 2.5 mm) were made out of each restorative material (CAD/CAM resin composite -RC), polymer-infiltrated ceramic - PIC and glass ceramic (VS), totaling 450 blocks. Fifty blocks of each material were submitted to a 60-day in situ aging by fixing the blocks into cavities prepared in the posterior region of the base of complete dentures. The aged and non-aged blocks were randomly divided into 30 groups of 10 (N = 300) according to the following factors: “Restorative material”, “Surface Treatment”, and “Aging”. Z350 resin composite cylinders were made on the surface of the blocks, and the specimens were submitted to thermocycling, shear test, failure mode analysis, and complementary analyses of roughness, fungal and bacterial CFUs, SEM, and EDS. The SBS (MPa) and CFU/mL data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey’s test (5%). The other variables were analyzed by qualitative analyzes. Results The ""aging"" factor was significant for RC and VS and the ""surface treatment"" factor was significant for the three restorative materials. Hydrofluoric (HF) acid etching followed by silanization was the best protocol for PIC and VS and diamond bur + SBU was the best protocol for RC. CFU/mL was similar among the restorative materials. Conclusion In situ aging reduced the bond strength between the resin composite repair and RC and VS materials. Clinical Significance The repair protocol for each restorative material is different and may be influenced by the time of clinical use.","","CAD / CAM, Surface treatment, Bond strength, Dental ceramics, Shear strength, Microbiology","",""

Data Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, and cohort studies of implant-supported single crowns with different dental abutment materials. Sources A systematic search was conducted by an electronic search in 6 databases without restrictions on September 16, 2018, complemented by a manual search. “Grey” literatures were also searched. Study selection Of 3417 studies initially retrieved, thirteen were eligible for inclusion. After studies selected and data extraction, pair-wise and network meta-analyses were performed to analyze the survival rate of the abutment, the marginal bone loss and the soft tissue discoloration. The risk of bias was assessed based on the Cochrane guidelines, Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and funnel plots. Statistical heterogeneity, inconsistencies, and cumulative ranking were also evaluated. Results Fourteen RCTs and nine non-RCTs were included. No significant differences was detected among titanium (Ti), zirconia (Zr), gold (Au), and alumina (Al) abutments in terms of survival rate (excluding Al < Ti (P < 0.05), marginal bone loss (excluding Zr  < Ti (P < 0.05) and Au  > Zr (P < 0.05)), or discoloration of peri-implant soft tissue. Additionally, Ti abutment had the highest cumulative ranking of survival rate (97.9%); Al abutment had the lowest marginal bone loss (81.4%) and Zr abutment had the least discoloration of peri-implant soft tissue (84.8%). Conclusions Ti abutment has a comparable survival rate with Zr, but better than Al. In addition, Zr abutment has a better effect in maintaining the marginal bone level, compared with Au and Ti. However, there was no difference in the discoloration of peri-implant soft tissue among Au, Ti, and Zr abutment. Clinical significance Based on the results of our network meta-analysis, Zr might be a recommended abutment material considering the clinical efficacy of implant-supported single crowns.","","Dental abutment, Implant-supported, Single crown, Survival rate, Complications, Network meta-analysis","",""

Methods Non-carious teeth were subjected to μTBS test (N = 15 for each group) and stressed until failure. μTBS was evaluated immediately and after 12-month storage in artificial saliva at 37 °C. Dentin powder was obtained from additional teeth (N = 7) for gelatin zymography, while for in situ zymography, 3 teeth for each group were selected. Gelatin and in situ zymography were performed in dentin powder and slices of dentin, respectively, to assess the ability of 0.2% CHX blended within the adhesive to inhibit endogenous enzymatic activity. Results μTBS bond strength was higher in the CHX-containing groups, immediately as well as after aging. The bond strength significantly decreased after 12-month aging. The activation of endogenous MMPs was found to be related to the presence of CHX within the adhesive system and the bonding strategy employed. Conclusions Under this perspective 0.2% CHX blended within Peak Universal adhesive monomer seems to increase immediate bond strength, to preserve bond strength over time and to efficiently inhibit endogenous enzymatic activity in dentin. Hence, blending the CHX in low concentrations within the adhesive could be recommended as a feasible technique in every-day clinical practice. Clinical significance Using CHX-containing adhesives could be recommended due to several benefits: it seems to increase the longevity of the hybrid layer; the inhibitor appears to be efficiently delivered to the dentinal substrate and to inhibit endogenous enzymatic activity, without prolonging chair time.","","Chlorhexidine, Dental bonding systems, Hybrid Layer, Aging, Dentin","",""
