Methods A cross-sectional, online survey-based study was carried out amongst 378 GDPs - members of the dental practice-based research network in France (ReCOL). Bivariate comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test to assess the association of the respondent characteristics (age, gender…) with the decision to repair DRs, and responses to clinical cases. Results The response rate was 82.9%. 50.4% of the respondents declared they at least sometimes consider DRs repair in their clinical practice instead of DRs total replacement. For the 89.8% who at least rarely repaired DRs, the main characteristic determining the therapeutic strategy was the defect size (71%, mainly inclined to repair small defects), followed by the defect type (marginal defect or crack for more than 60% of the respondents) and the material of initial restoration (composite for 63.5%). When shown clinical photographs illustrating DRs, most of respondents proposed a replacement with inlay/onlay or crown. Conclusions This study indicates that a significant proportion of French GDPs do not make sufficient use of DR repair on a routine basis. A lack of knowledge of the concept seems to explain at least part of this situation. Collective and individual efforts from the profession are still needed to promote DR repair and therefore more often apply MinimalIntervention Dentistry. Clinical significance This survey shows that MID is not yet sufficiently used in routine practice in France regarding DR management. Further efforts (continuing education toward MID, public funding revaluation for MID strategies…) are needed to help GDPs to implement MID into everyday practice.","","Questionnaire survey, Defective restorations, France, General dental practitioners, Practice-based research network, Minimal intervention dentistry (MID)","",""

We aimed to systematically assess the consistency and quality of repair protocols. Data 808 records were initially identified and 71 repair protocols based on 84 sources included. The number of published sources over time increased exponentially (p < 0.001). Recommended treatment steps varied widely. Some treatment steps were only recommended by a minority of protocols, while others were consistently recommended (e.g. surface roughening, hydrofluoric acid etching of silicate ceramics, application of an adhesive/bonding agent). The overall quality of included sources was moderate (mean ± SD 3.7 ± 0.9 out of 7 points). Sources Electronic databases (Medline via PubMed, Embase) were searched, hand searches using Google and Google Scholar conducted, and the reference lists of included full texts screened and cross-referenced. Study selection (Non-)systematic reviews, working instructions, and textbooks with protocols on direct composite repair restorations for partially defective (1) composite, (2) amalgam, (3) porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFMs) with exposed metal base, (4) ceramic/PFMs without exposed metal base, and (5) full metal restorations were included. Data synthesis was performed by tabulation of recommended treatment steps and descriptive statistics. The quality of included sources was assessed based on a checklist for guideline appraisal (MiChe). Conclusions The main treatment steps were consistently reported across repair protocols.

Methods Two ion-releasing RBCs, Activa (ACT) and Cention-N (CN), were compared to a conventional RBC (Z350) and a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji-II-LC). Ten disk-shaped specimens were fabricated for each material (n = 40). After standardized surface polishing procedure, the surface properties of the specimens were evaluated using surface roughness measurements by a profilometer and hydrophobicity using water contact angle measurements. To assess bacterial adhesion, the number of S. mutans bacteria was calculated from colony-forming units (CFU). Confocal laser scanning microscope analysis was done for qualitative & quantitative assessment. The data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test to compare the mean values of surface roughness, water contact angle and CFU values. To compare the mean dead cell percentage Kruskal-Wallis rank test and Conover test were used. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was used to report the statistical significance. Results Z350 and ACT had the smoothest surfaces, followed by CN, and the roughest surface was seen in FUJI-II-LC. The lowest water contact angles were seen in CN, and Z350, and the highest were in ACT. S. mutans counts were the highest in ACT and the lowest in Z350 and CN. CN and Fuji-II-LC registered the highest percentage of dead bacterial cells, while the lowest were in ACT. Significance Surface properties did not significantly influence bacterial adhesion. More S. mutans bacteria accumulated on ACT than on the nanofilled composite and on CN.

Methods A 14-item validated survey questionnaire was mailed to directors/coordinators of operative/restorative dentistry teachers of Brazilian Dental Schools. Data were collected on demographic characteristics of the teachers and institutions, together with questions on the teaching of the repair of defective resin-based composite restorations as part of the school curriculum; the rationale behind the teaching; the nature of the teaching (preclinical and/or clinical); how techniques were taught, indications for repair, operative techniques, materials used, patient acceptability and expected longevity of completed repairs. Results Two hundred and twenty-two (94%) directors/ coordinators of dental curricula in Brazil were contacted. One hundred and thirty-one directors/coordinators (59%) replied, providing the e-mail address from the teacher responsible for the operative/restorative dentistry program in their school. Of these, 104 responded to the questionnaire (79% response rate). Ninety-three (89%) of the participating schools reported teaching composite repairs as an alternative to replacing restorations. Of the theoretical content, 43% was taught at preclinical and clinical levels, whereas most practical experience (53%) was acquired at clinical levels. Eighty-eight schools (95%) reported tooth substance preservation being the main reason for teaching repair techniques. All schools that taught repairs reported high patient acceptability. Conclusions The teaching of composite restoration repair as an alternative to restoration replacement is established in undergraduate programs in most of the Brazilian dental schools surveyed. Clinical significance The reasons for teaching restoration repair in Brazil were found to be quite unanimous among teachers, especially regarding the preservation of tooth structure. Variations were found in the clinical indications for repair, suggesting the need for further investigations. Monitoring repaired restorations should be encouraged and could contribute to future studies.","","Composite resins, Decision-making, Questionnaire, Restoration repair, Teaching","",""

Methods Inclusion criteria for this multicenter clinical retrospective study were fully or partially edentulous patients who had been treated with a sleeveless and keyless guided implant surgery system (R2Gate®, Megagen), and who had been rehabilitated with fixed restorations, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. All surgeries and prosthetic procedures were conducted following the same protocol, and data were obtained from the patients’ medical records. The outcomes were the fit and stability of the surgical guide, any intra-operative and immediate post-operative complications, any biologic and prosthetic complications that occurred during the 1-year follow-up period, implant survival, and prosthetic success. Results Sixty patients were selected for the installation of 124 implants, through a guided procedure: 66 sleeveless, keyless surgical guides were manufactured. The incidence of immediate intra-operative (lack of space: 12.1%; lack of implant stability 2.6%) and immediate post-operative (pain and discomfort: 6.6%; mild swelling 3.3%) complications was low. In total, 112/124 implants (90.3%) were successfully placed with a guided procedure, in 52 patients; among them, 82 (73.2%) were placed with a flapless procedure. Thirty fixtures supported single crowns (SCs), 42 fixed partial dentures (FPDs) and 52 full-arch (FA) restorations. Sixty-two fixed prosthetic restorations (30 SCs, 22 FPDs and 10 FAs) were delivered; among these restorations, 15 (24.1%) were subjected to immediate functional loading. All implants (100%) survived. Two implants had peri‑implant mucositis (1.6%), two SCs had abutment screw loosenings (1.6%), two FAs and one FPD had ceramic chipping/fracture (2.4%), for an overall prosthetic success amounting to 88.7%. Conclusions Within the limits of this study, this novel guided surgery system appeared to be clinically reliable; further studies are needed to confirm these results.

Methods An observational study of four dental practices and the clinics of a UK undergraduate dental teaching hospital was conducted. A range of routine common procedures were observed by trained and calibrated observers; these were: Examinations, endodontics, periodontics, direct placement restorations, fixed and removable prosthodontics and oral surgery. The PPE items used before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were also included. Results Routine ‘surgery set up’ generic items present a significant proportion of SUP plastic waste as these are used in every instance of patient treatment. An average of twenty-one (n = 21) SUP plastic waste items are used for every procedure with a mean mass of 354 g per procedure (including set up and clean up). The use of PPE increased from 14 items (pre-COVID -19) to 19 items during the pandemic. SUP items are constructed from a single plastic or from multiple plastics forming compound structures (heteropolymers); with an approximate 50:50 distribution. Conclusions The dental profession, at the point of care, uses a high volume of single use plastic that becomes clinical waste. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) significantly increased during the COVID 19 pandemic and this accounts for the single greatest contribution of single use plastic, as this is used for every clinical procedure.

We used 3-years interim data for this evaluation. FDI-2 criteria were applied and teeth requiring repair, re-restoration, endodontic treatment or extraction recorded. Our outcome was the time until any or major complications (requiring endodontic treatment or extraction) occurred. Costs were calculated in US Dollar (USD) 2018, with the local currencies being converted using Purchasing Power Parities. To estimate initial and re-treatment costs, a payers’ perspective was taken and direct medical costs estimated from fee item catalogues. Incremental-cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were used to express the cost difference per gained or lost effectiveness. Results Overall costs were lower for GH than CO in Croatia, Turkey and Serbia, while this difference was minimal in Italy. GH tended to survive longer than CO in Croatia and Italy, and shorter in Serbia and Turkey; overall survival time was not significantly different (p = 0.67/log-rank). The cost-effectiveness differences indicated CO to be more expensive at limited (ICER: 268.5 USD/month without any complications) or no benefit at all (-186.2 USD/month without major complications). Conclusions GH was less costly than CO both initially and over 3 years. Efficacy differences were extremely limited.

Conclusion The findings of this review provided an insight into the performance of available dental materials assessed using different recurrent caries models, yet this review cannot be used as a guideline for material selection. Selecting the appropriate restorative material relies on several patient-related factors such as microbiota, occlusion, and diet that are not comprehensively taken into consideration in recurrent caries models and thus hinder reliable comparison. Clinical Significance Due to the heterogenicity of variables among studies on the performance of dental restorative materials, this scoping review aimed to provide insights for dental researchers concerning the available recurrent caries models, testing methods used, and aspects of comparison between these materials including their characteristics and limitations.","","Antibacterial agents, Bioactive, Composite resins, Tooth remineralization, Recurrent caries, Dental materials, Nanoparticles","",""

Methods Full-mouth (pre-treatment) grading was performed on digital greyscale scan records for 34 participants (35.3 ± 8.4 years) with signs of moderate-to-severe generalised tooth wear, using the Tooth Wear Evaluation System and the Basic Erosive Wear Examination. Each participant received full-mouth direct resin composite restorations, with increased VDO. The post-treatment increase in the VDO was determined. Recalls were planned after 1 month, and after 1, 3, and 5 years. Three ‘levels’ of restoration failure were described. The effects of the variables on the frequencies of restoration failure were calculated with a multivariable Cox regression, (p < 0.05). Results 1269 restorations were placed with a mean observation period of 62.4 months. Increasing the VDO by 1 mm significantly reduced the risks of all levels of anterior restoration failure (HR ≤ 0.62, p ≤ 0.025). A higher anterior BEWE surface score was associated with increased risks of Level 2- & 3- failures, (HR ≥ 1.29, p ≤ 0.019). Premolar restorations showed lower risks of Level 2- & 3- failure, compared to the molar restorations, (HR ≤ 0.5, p ≤ 0.005). Conclusion Levels of pre-treatment wear and the applied change in the VDO significantly affected failure risk. Clinical relevance Direct resin composite restorations for the rehabilitation of wear should be made as voluminous as possible, respecting the presenting biological, functional, and esthetic constraints.","","Severe tooth wear, Restorative treatment, Tooth wear, Composite resin restorations, Survival, Clinical study, Interventions, Increase vertical dimension of occlusion, TWES, TWES2.0, BEWE","",""

High success rates have been reported for the use of pulpotomy in managing pulp exposure resulting from extensive caries. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pulpotomy and associated medicaments in saving permanent teeth with pulp exposure resulting from extensive caries. Sources Multiple databases were searched on January 12, 2019, without limitations on the language or year of publication. Study selection Randomized controlled trials comparing pulpotomy with alternative treatments, or comparing two or more medicaments in pulpotomy for permanent teeth with carious pulp exposure were included. Data Seventeen studies reported in 21 articles were included. Intention-to-treat analyses on studies comparing pulpotomy and other treatment modalities tended to favor pulpotomy. Meta-analysis was not performed on comparisons of pulpotomy and other treatments because of the limited number of studies. Most evidence on comparisons among different pulpotomy medicaments was found in trials comparing mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and calcium hydroxide, with the results of meta-analyses favoring MTA. Data were insufficient to determine the cost-effectiveness of successful modality. Conclusions Pulpotomy is a prospective substitute for root canal treatment in managing permanent teeth with carious pulp exposures, even in permanent teeth with irreversible pulpitis. Large, well-designed trials comparing pulpotomy with other treatments in terms of cost-effectiveness should be informative. Clinical significance The success of pulpotomy in managing irreversible pulpitis challenges the rhetoric that irreversible pulpitis can only be managed by root canal treatment. Cost-effectiveness analysis rather than analysis on effectiveness of treatment outcome alone should be considered in all health care domains to evaluate the benefits of alternative treatment options.","","Cost-benefit analysis, Dental caries, Meta-analysis, Pulpotomy, Pulpitis, Systematic review","",""

Materials and methods 103 patients (mean age = 43.1 years) were divided into two groups based on cluster analysis; cluster A (61 patients) and cluster B (42 patients). The distribution of wear lesions, scores of presence or absence of 10 defined morphological TW criteria and number of teeth fulfilling each criteria were compared between groups. Intra- and inter-examiner reliability of the 10 TW criteria was determined by Cohen’s kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient. Results While cluster A had more wear in maxillary anterior teeth and mandibular molars compared with the same opposing tooth groups (p < 0.001, p < 0.007 respectively), there were no differences for cluster B. Cluster A was characterized by higher prevalence of 4 chemical morphological criteria and the highest number of teeth affected by one chemical criteria, whereas cluster B had a higher prevalence of one mechanical criteria and higher number of teeth affected by an additional mechanical criteria. Both intra- and inter-examiner values for the defined TW criteria were fair to excellent.

Methods The maxilla and mandible of a fully dentate cadaver were scanned by the ATOS industrial scanner to create a master model. Then, the specimens were scanned eight times by each intraoral scanner (IOS). In addition, 8 polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) impressions were made and digitized with a Medit T710 desktop scanner. Stone models were then poured and again scanned with the desktop scanner. All IOS, PVS, and stone models were compared to the master model to calculate the mean absolute surface deviation for mandibular teeth, maxillary teeth, and palate. Results For mandibular teeth, the PVS trueness was only significantly better than the Medit i700 (p < 0.001) and Primescan (p < 0.05). In maxillary teeth, the PVS trueness was significantly better than all IOSs (p < 0.05–0.001); the stone trueness was significantly better than Emerald S (p < 0.01), Medit i700 (p < 0.001) and Primescan (p < 0.01). In the palate, PVS and stone trueness were significantly lower than the iTero Element 5D (p < 0.01) and Trios 4 (p < p < 0.01). Stone trueness was significantly lower than the Medit i700 (p < 0.05).

Significant differences in trueness between the IOSs were observed only in the mandibular teeth. The Medit i700 performed worse than Emerald S (p < 0.01) and iTero Element 5D (p < 0.01). For mandibular teeth, the Medit i700 was significantly more precise than Primescan (p < 0.01) and the Emerald S (p < 0.05). The Trios 4 was significantly less precise than Emerald S (p < 0.05).

Conclusions In general, indirectly digitized models from PVS impressions had higher trueness than IOS for maxillary teeth; precision between the two methods was similar. IOS was more accurate for palatal tissues. The differences in trueness and precision for mandibular teeth between the various techniques were negligible. Clinical significance All investigated IOSs and indirect digitization could be used for complete arch scanning in mandibular and maxillary dentate arches.

Background Cracks are a common clinical finding in teeth and yet clinicians still struggle to identify the full extent and orientation of cracks for their appropriate timely management. The biomechanics of crack development can be due to multiple factors and can differ from an unrestored tooth to a restored or endodontically treated tooth. Data & sources This narrative review has been designed following the guidelines published by Green et al. 2006 [1] Published literature in the English language that addresses the objectives of this review up to July 2022 was sourced from online databases and reference lists. The relevance of the papers was assessed and discussed by two reviewers. A total of 101 publications were included in this narrative review. Conclusions The initiation and development of cracks in teeth are likely linked to an interplay between the masticatory forces and fracture resistance of the remaining tooth structure. From the identified literature, the quality and quantity of remaining tooth structure in a restored or endodontically-treated tooth affects the biomechanics of crack development compared to an unrestored tooth. The extent, orientation, and size of the cracks do affect a clinician's ability to detect cracks in teeth. There is still a need to develop reliable diagnostic tools that will accurately identify cracks in teeth beneath restorations to enable effective monitoring of their propagation and provide appropriate interventions. Clinical significance The development and propagation of cracks in an unrestored tooth differ greatly from a restored and endodontically treated tooth; mainly linked to the quantity and quality of the remaining tooth structure and the forces acting on them. Identifying the extent of cracks in teeth remains challenging for early clinical intervention.","","Cracked tooth, Fractured tooth, Cracked tooth syndrome, Dental crack propagation","",""

Methods The study involved repairing 130 Class I and II defective composite restorations. After recurrent caries removal, the repair process included etching with 37 % phosphoric acid, Adper Single Bond 2 application for bonding and Filtek Z250 composite for restoring all defects. The restoration surfaces were subjected to one of the following additional surface treatments within the repair process: Control: No additional treatment; the Silane-Adhesive treatment: A separate step involved the application of a silane coupling agent after acid etching; and the Sandblast-Silane-Adhesive treatment: included intra-oral sandblasting of old composite surfaces followed by silane application. Two calibrated examiners evaluated all repaired restorations according to a modified USPHS criteria after 6 months. Comparisons of the clinical performance between the treatment groups were made using Chi-square test, while responses to cold tests before and after repair treatment were made using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank's (α = 0.05).

Methods A multi-national (Croatia, Serbia, Italy, Turkey) split-mouth randomized trial comparing GH and CO in occlusal-proximal two-surfaced cavities in permanent molars (n=180/360 patients/molars) provided data on restoration failure and allocation probabilities (i.e. failure requiring re-restoration, repair or endodontic therapy). Using Markov modelling, we followed molars over the lifetime of an initially 12-years-old individual. Our health outcome was the time a tooth was retained. A mixed-payers’ perspective within German healthcare was used to determine costs (in Euro 2018) using fee item catalogues. Monte-Carlo-microsimulations, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER)s and cost-effectiveness-acceptability were quantified. Results In the base-case scenario, CO was more effective (tooth retention for a mean (SD) 54.4 (1.7) years) but also more costly (694 (54) Euro) than GH (53.9 (1.7) years; 614 (56 Euro). The ICER was 158 Euro/year, i.e. payers needed to be willing to invest 158 Euro per additional year of tooth retention when using CO. In a sensitivity analysis, this finding was confirmed or GH found more effective and less costly. Conclusion CO was more costly and limitedly more effective than GH, and while there is uncertainty around our findings, GH is likely a cost-effectiveness option for restoring permanent molars. Clinical significance When considering the long-term (life-time) cost-effectiveness, GH showed cost savings but CO was limitedly more effective.

Data In vitro studies that compared the antibacterial effects of resin-based restorative dental materials with and without antibacterial additives were screened. Risk bias was assessed, and the following data were extracted: antibacterial additive, parental dental material, curing mode, bacterial growth outcome assessment, samples used as a substrate for bacterial growth, inoculum complexity, and culture time as an indicator of biofilm maturity. Source Arksey and O’Malley’s five stages framework using Medline (OVID), EMBASE, and Scopus (Elsevier) databases guided this review. Study selection From 6503 studies initially identified, 348 studies were considered eligible for full-text screening, and 153 were included for data extraction. Almost all studies have a high sampling bias related to both sample size and blindness. Quaternary ammonium monomers were the most investigated additive (45 %), and the most prevailing parental material was resin composite (49 %). There was extensive methodological heterogeneity among the studies for outcome assessment with the majority using resin composite disks (78 %), mono-species Streptococcus mutans as the inoculum (54 %), and a relatively short period of biofilm growth (≤24 h). Conclusion The findings herein present the urgent need for improved biological efficacy studies in this important and exciting field. There is a need for efforts to improve study designs to mimic the oral environment in vivo and to develop standardized methods to help understand and optimize these materials. Clinical significance Most studies that incorporate antibacterial additives into resin-based materials claim promising results by bacterial reduction.

Methods A validated 14-item questionnaire was mailed to the directors of the operative/restorative dentistry department in 40 MENA dental schools. Data were collected on teaching, including whether the repair of resin-based composite restorations was part of the dental school curriculum; the rationale behind the teaching; how techniques were taught, indications for repair, operative techniques, materials used, patient acceptability and expected longevity of the repair procedure. Results Thirty-two schools responded to the survey (response rate of 80%). Twenty-two (69%) schools reported the teaching of resin-based composite repairs as an alternative to the replacement of restorations. Of the schools not teaching repairs, 80% indicated that they plan to include this topic in the curriculum within the next five years. Most schools taught theoretical and practical aspects of repair at a clinical level only. Two-thirds of schools reported tooth substance preservation being the main reason for teaching repair techniques. The main indications for repair treatment were marginal defects (59%), followed by partial loss of restoration (56%). Most schools that performed repairs reported high patient acceptability. Considerable variation was noted in relation to expected longevity of resin- based composite repairs. Conclusions The repair of defective resin-based composite restorations is actively taught within most of the surveyed schools. Advantages of repair, compared to replacement include minimum intervention, preservation of tooth structure, and savings of time and cost. Clinical significance The decision between replacing or repairing a defective resin-based composite restoration in the MENA region tends to be based on clinicians’ subjective experience and judgement. However, to further enhance the teaching of resin-based composite repair standardised guidelines need to be developed based on existing evidence.","","Teaching, Repair, Defective resin-based composite restorations","",""

Methods Thirteen groups of materials were investigated. Cylindrical-shaped specimens were fabricated. Deionised water or lactic-acid solution were used as the storage media. Solutions were changed after 1d, 4d, 7d, and 14d of ion release and at the same periods after recharge with MI Varnish (7 -h storage). F, Ca, and P measurements were accomplished using a fluoride-ion selective electrode, atomic absorption spectrometry, and colourimetric method by spectrophotometer, respectively. Relative Vickers hardness was proceeded with similar specimens used in the F assay (4 periods). SEM/EDS was additionally performed. Statistical analyses were calculated in each parameter (p < 0.05). Result Hardness of several ILMs immediately increased after recharge. After 28d, Ketac Universal [a high-viscosity glass-ionomer cement (HVGIC)] showed the highest hardness similar to the resin composite control. Although 2 HVGICs (Zirconomer and Equia Forte Fil) ranked as first and second for F release/re-release, some HVGICs had inferior or comparable F capacity to RMGICs (Fuji VIII and Fuji II LC) and a resin-based (RB) ILM (Cention N). Cention N, Activa-Restorative (RB-ILM), and Zirconomer were the top-3 ranking for Ca release/re-release. Activa-Restorative showed the highest P release, whereas Cention N displayed the greatest recharge ability for P. Conclusions Zirconomer showed a versatile performance for ion-release/re-release, especially for F. Cention N had excellent capacity in relation to Ca release and recharge ability of Ca/P. Clinical significance With the F varnish recharge protocol, Zirconomer, Equia Forte, and Fuji VIII seems to have an ability to inhibit initial caries initiation. Cention N is a promising resin-based material that could be an alternative for high caries risk patients due to the high Ca release/recharge with acceptable F release.","","Fluoride, Calcium, Release, Recharge, Glass ionomer cement, Resin composite","",""

The most common complaints associated with tooth wear are dissatisfaction with dental appearance and a negative impact on the experienced Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL). The aim of this study was to investigate the change in OHRQoL and the perception of aesthetics, following restorative treatment of moderate to severe tooth wear patients, with a five-year follow-up. Methods An explorative study, based on prospective data, was performed. OHRQoL and the perception of aesthetics were measured with the OHIP-NL and OES-NL. These questionnaires were completed before treatment, one month after treatment, and at 1-, 3- and 5-years post-treatment. Treatment involved full mouth reconstruction with composite resin restorations. The data was analysed as repeated measures by using a linear mixed-effects model. Results One hundred and twenty-three tooth wear patients that received restorative rehabilitation were included (97 males, 26 females, 37.5 ± 8.8 years-old). Data showed a statistically significant increase in both experienced OHRQoL and orofacial appearance after restorative treatment. The OHIP-scores remained stable over time, while the OES-scores slightly decreased during the years after treatment. Regarding the seven domains of the OHIP, the largest difference in OHIP-score was found in the domain of ‘Psychological Discomfort’. The mean overall OHIP-score was 1.8 at baseline and 1.3 at the 5-years recall. The mean OES score increased from 41.8 at baseline to 66.1 at the 5-years follow-up. Conclusions Tooth wear patients reported significant improvements in their OHRQoL and their perception of orofacial aesthetics after restorative treatment. This increase remained at least five years post-treatment. Clinical Significance The clinical impact of restorative treatment for tooth wear patients is considerable.

Sources Electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched in January 2023. Data Forty sources reporting on 34 studies having surveyed 1,286 dental schools were included. Overall, 92.7% (95%-CI: 88.2-95.5) of dental schools reported to teach PCRs. PCRs in three-surface Class II cavities are taught by 82.0% (95%-CI: 70.4-89.7). The mandatory use of liners in deep cavities is taught by 78.3% (95%-CI: 68.9-85.5), and 44.0% (95%-CI: 34.3-54.2) reported to teach bulk-fill composites. While most posterior restorations placed by students were composites (56.1%; 95%-CI: 46.0-65.8), 94.7% (95%-CI: 86.6-98.0) of dental schools (still) teach posterior amalgam restorations. The proportion of dental schools teaching PCRs in three-surface Class II cavities increased and the mean proportion of PCRs among all posterior restorations increased over time (padj.≤0.003). Conclusions The teaching of PCRs in dental schools around the world reflects the increased use of resin composite in clinical practice, with students in countries where dental amalgam continues to be used, placing more posterior composites than restorations of dental amalgam. The teaching of PCRs, which is anticipated to increase, will continue to be refined with further developments in adhesive materials, devices, instrumentation, and techniques.

The disks were fixed to extracted human molars with or without carious lesions of one of three standardized sizes. A total of 240 stacks of cross-sectional scans obtained using an 870-nm SD-OCT with enhanced depth imaging (EDI) were presented to five raters. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by rating the teeth beneath the cemented material as carious or healthy. Results Carious samples were distinguished from sound teeth with high diagnostic accuracy, even for early stage caries. Sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) pooled over all raters and all materials were 0.9 and 0.97, respectively.

Methods Dental composites were prepared with varying amounts of polishing and incubated in a CDC bioreactor with an approximate shear of 0.4 Pa. S. mutans biofilms developed in the bioreactors fed sucrose or glucose and at 10-h or 40-h HRT for one week. Biofilms were characterized by confocal laser microscopy (CLM). Composite surface roughness was characterized by optical profilometry, and pre- and post-incubation composite surface fine structure and elemental composition were determined using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Results Polishing had a significant impact on surface roughness, varying by a factor of 15 between the polished samples and the unpolished control. S. mutans biofilms grew statistically significantly thicker on the unpolished composites. Biofilm thickness was greater at shorter 10-h HRT compared to 40-h HRT. In most cases, biofilm thickness was not statistically significantly greater in sucrose-fed bioreactors than in glucose-fed bioreactors. SEM-EDS analysis did not identify any significant change in elemental composition after aging. Conclusions Accurate characterization of oral cavity biofilms must consider shear forces and the use of techniques that minimize alteration of the biofilm structure. Under shear, surface smoothness is the most important factor determining S. mutans biofilm thickness followed by HRT, while sucrose presence did not result in significantly greater biofilm thickness. Clinical Significance The obvious patterns of S. mutans growth along sub-micron scale grooving created by the polishing process suggested that initial biofilm attachment occurred in the shear-protected grooves.

Therefore, this study aimed to quantify BPA present as an impurity and to evaluate whether their degradation by salivary, bacterial, and chemical challenges could increase its release. Methods BPA was determined in three different amounts (300, 400, and 500 µg) of eight unpolymerized resin-based materials (four composites, one fissure sealant, two adhesives and one root canal sealer). Next, polymerized samples (n = 5) of each material were immersed in 1 mL of whole human pooled saliva collected from adults, Streptococcus mutans (2 × 107 CFU/mL), and acidic (0.1 M HCl), alkaline (0.1 M NaOH), and control media, respectively. The amount of BPA was quantified using an UPLC-MS/MS method including derivatization of BPA by pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride. Results Only the composites contained trace amounts of BPA above the limit of quantification (ranging from 301±32 pg PBA/mg to 1534±62 pg BPA/mg), most likely as impurity from the synthesis of the monomers. The amounts of BPA released from polymerized materials upon salivary and bacterial degradation were too low for accurate quantification, but in water, quantifiable amounts of BPA were released from all materials. In alkaline media, the BPA release from two composites was significantly decreased, while the release from one adhesive was significantly increased, compared to water. Conclusions BPA already present in unpolymerized resin-based materials may account for the release of BPA after polymerization. There was no clear indication that short-term material degradation leads to increased release of BPA.","","Resin-based dental materials, Composite, Bisphenol A, Endocrine disruptor, Degradation","",""

This study tests the antibacterial properties of a novel bulk-fill flowable composite (Infinx™, Nobio™ Ltd.) containing quaternary ammonium silica (QASi) filler particles. Methods Infinix™ was tested in-vitro by the direct contact test (DCT), using E. faecalis or whole saliva as inoculum. A similar formula composite without QASi served as a control. In addition, composite test samples were polymerized on three volunteers' intact buccal enamel surfaces of mandibular first premolars in a split-mouth design experiment. Traditional composite served as control (Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable, 3M). Bacterial viability on the composite surfaces weres assessed ex-vivo microscopically six months later, using a fluorescent dead/live stain. Images of each bacterial sample were taken using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i), and further live/total cell analysis was performed using ImageJ software. Results Following direct contact with one week of aged Infinix, more than 1 million E. faecalis bacteria were killed. Similarly, when using the saliva as inoculum, no single microorganism survived. Six-month in-vivo experiments supported these results by showing a reduction of 54%, 30% and 28% in live/total number of bacteria ratio retrieved from antibacterial composite vs. the control in volunteers #1, #2, #3 respectively. Conclusion Within the limitations of the experimental design, the present study suggest that antibacterial activity of quaternary ammonium silica particles (QASi) is comparable to that of previously described quaternary ammonium polyethyleneimine particles (QPEI). In addition, whole saliva bacteria are effectively killed by QASi-containing composite in-vitro and in-vivo, for a period of six month at least. Long-term full-scale clinical study is needed to confirm the findings of the present study and their implication on maintaining health balance.

The objectives of this study were to develop a new bioactive nanocomposite with remineralizing and antibiofilm properties by incorporating dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and nano-calcium fluoride (nCaF2). Methods nCaF2 was produced via a spray-drying method and integrated at 15% mass fraction into composite. DMAHDM was added at 3% mass fraction. Mechanical properties and F and Ca ion releases were assessed. Colony-forming units (CFU), lactic acid and metabolic activity of biofilms on composites were performed. Results The new composites had flexural strengths of (95.28±6.32) MPa and (125.93±7.49) MPa, which were within the ISO recommendations. Biofilm CFU were reduced by 3–4 log (p<0.05). The composites achieved high F releases of (0.89±0.01) mmol/L and (0.44±0.01) mmol/L, and Ca releases of (1.46±0.05) mmol/L and (0.54±0.005) mmol/L. Conclusions New nanocomposites were developed with good mechanical properties, potent antibacterial activity against salivary biofilms, and high F and Ca ion releases with potential for remineralization. Clinical Significance Novel nanocomposites using nCaF2 and DMAHDM were developed with potent antibacterial and remineralizing effects and high F and Ca ion releases.

Methods The study involved 76 dentists from private and hospital practices. Assessments of successes and failures of previous restorations used a simplified rating with FDI criteria 3 to 8, 11, 12, and 14. The results were examined versus tooth location, number of restored surfaces, type of restoration, and filling material. Results The dentists examined 4,612 dental restorations, of which 4,185 direct fillings mainly with resin composite materials (2,555). Of all restorations, 2,048 (44.4%) were considered as failures, of which 1,489 had one or two criteria for ‘clinically unsatisfactory/poor restoration’. As simplified, the esthetic criterion ‘color match’ was the most frequent criterion for failure (912 cases). The rate of restoration failures was found associated with the number of surfaces restored and the use of glass-ionomer cement. Results are not comparable with others obtained with original FDI criteria. Conclusions Assessing dental restorations with the original FDI criteria leads generally to much more failure statements than practitioners’ decisions to reintervene. Though requiring some adjustment (e.g., regarding ‘color match’), the simplified assessment proved convenient and amenable to standardization. Clinical Significance Regardless of the type of practice, selecting, understanding, and optimal interpreting of FDI criteria for failure is essential to help practitioners faced with daily dilemmas of replacement vs. repair of failed dental restorations. Standardization of simplified criteria is desirable to help comparing research data.","","Clinical assessment, Dental filling, Dental restoration failure, FDI criteria, Restorative dentistry","",""

Methods One hundred and fifty (150) 4-8-year-old children were selected, randomly allocated and treated in school tables according to the restorative material: Fuji IX Gold Label (GC Corp), Vitro Molar (nova DFL) and Maxxion R (FGM), the latter two being low-cost brands. Materials and professionals’ costs were considered to analyse baseline total cost, and from this the cumulative cost of each treatment was calculated. Restoration assessments were performed after 2, 6, 12 and 24 months by an independent calibrated examiner. Restoration survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression was used to test association with clinical factors. Bootstrap regression (1,000 replications) compared material´s cost over time and Monte-Carlo simulation was used to build cost-effectiveness scatter plots. Results The overall survival rate of occlusal ART restorations after 2 years was 53% (Fuji IX = 72.7%; Vitro Molar = 46.5%; Maxxion R = 39.6%). Restorations performed with Vitro Molar and Maxxion R were more likely to fail when compared to Fuji IX.

Methods Seven patients (n = 192 restorations) with severe tooth wear were included. Patient data were recorded, and an occlusal analysis and a tissue-guided wax-up were realized. After replacement of old fillings, no-prep Vita Enamic restorations (posterior restorations and palatal veneers) were bonded within 24 h. Direct composites were performed to mask the buccal joint on anterior teeth. Maxillo-facial physiotherapy was performed. Restorations were evaluated following World Dental Federation criteria.

The universal adhesive systems used were Heliobond™, Tokuyama bond force II™ and Scotchbond Universal™. A nanohybrid resin composite was applied as the repair material. Negative and positive control groups were included. Stick shape specimens of each group were subjected to μTBS testing. Representative samples from all test groups were subjected to microscopic, proﬁlometric and SEM examination to determine their mode of failure.

Confusion exists in the literature in terms of the indication and rationale for each VPT approach. The objectives of the present study are to elucidate the indications for VPT and to present a set of histopathology and histobacteriology-based guidelines for VPT in teeth with deep caries. Methods Two hundred and sixty-four carious, unrestored and VPT-treated human teeth, which were extracted for reasons not related to the present study. The teeth were processed for histological and histobacteriological examination. Other 757 clinical cases that received different VPT procedures were followed-up to identify success rates, with the longest observational period of 30 years. Results Follow-up of the clinical cases indicated that direct pulp capping was successful in 73.2%, partial pulpotomy in 96.4% and full pulpotomy in 77.8% of the cases. Histological and histobacteriological examination showed a localised inflammatory response that commonly occurred in the subjacent pulp tissue as soon as the enamel was penetrated by caries. If the softened and infected dentine were completely excavated, without pulp exposure, and the cavity restored with an adequate restoration, pulp inflammation frequently subsided. In teeth showing pulp exposure, the extent of bacterial penetration varied and areas of infection presented severe pulp inflammation, including micro-abscesses. However, the pulp tissue apical to the infected/inflamed area was usually uninflamed and normal. Guidelines based on the present histopathological, histobacteriological and clinical findings are proposed for VPT and mainly involve direct examination of dentine and the exposed pulp tissue under deep caries for decision-making, and require strict asepsis during procedures. Conclusions Vital pulp therapy following the guidelines proposed in the present article has the potential to improve the outcome of the conservative treatment of mature teeth with deep caries and in some occasions may be an alternative to pulpectomy. Clinical Significance A guideline for VPT in the treatment of deep caries is proposed, focusing on direct observation of dentine and the exposed pulp tissue under deep caries.

Methods The data were collected from the electronic patient files of City of Oulu Public Dental Services (Finland). Study population consisted of 71 dry mouth patients and 142 control patients. The survival of 3208 restorations were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox regression analysis with shared frailty for patients. Separate analyses were performed for the survival of the teeth. Results The hazard ratio of restorations in dry mouth patients was 2.08 (95% CI: 1.65-2.63) compared to the control patients. For the dry mouth patients, the fixed prosthetic crowns outlasted composite fillings of all sizes, but the difference increased concomitantly with the filling size. The dry mouth patients had hazard ratio of 1.98 (95% CI: 1.02-3.82) for tooth extractions compared to the control patients. The teeth with fixed prosthetic crowns outlasted the teeth with direct restorative materials. Conclusions The survival time of restorations and teeth are severely shortened in patients with dry mouth. Especially the survival time of the large composites is short in dry mouth patients whereas fixed prosthetic crowns have acceptable survival time also in dry mouth patients. Clinical significance When informing a dry mouth patient on the expected survival of a restoration or tooth, one should take into account that dry mouth patients´ restorations and teeth have severely shortened survival time.","","Hyposalivation, Xerostomia, Restoration, Survival, Composite, Crown","",""

Methods We conducted a before-after intervention study and a qualitative study. Two web-based questionnaire surveys were conducted among 197 Japanese dentists. In the first questionnaire, a baseline EPG was measured using six questionnaire items. Subsequently, feedback material about the EPG was electronically prepared, including results of the first questionnaire, international comparisons with a previous study from the US, and a summary of recent evidence on MID. In the second questionnaire, the EPG was re-measured after participants read the material. The primary outcome was mean overall concordance between published evidence and the dentist's clinical practice for all six questions. During the second questionnaire, we performed qualitative content analysis using free-text responses to a question about difficult situations encountered when conducting MID. Results Regarding before and after comparisons of concordance between the first and second questionnaires, mean overall concordance improved significantly, from 66% to 89% (p<0.001). Qualitative content analysis identified five difficult situations: “cases where decision making for treatment and prognosis is difficult”, “inadequate practice resources”, “limitations on patient visit and treatment period”, “discrepancy between MID and the patient's values”, and “limitations on health insurance and social understanding”. Conclusions These results suggest that it is possible to reduce the EPG in MID using a web-based educational intervention among Japanese dentists. Qualitative content analysis revealed five difficult situations that might hinder implementation of MID. Clinical Significance Although this intervention demonstrated educational effects, perfect concordance was not achieved by all participants. This is possibly associated with the five situations that participants reported facing when conducting MID. Creating an environment to improve these situations may facilitate a reduction in the EPG.","","Evidence-practice gap, Minimal intervention dentistry, Evidence-based dentistry, Practice-based research","",""

Responses were compiled in Excel and analyzed. Results The response rate of this study was of 94% (n = 15). All respondent schools taught the use of posterior composites for occlusal and occluso-proximal cavities in premolars and molars. The mean percentage of preclinical teaching devoted to composites was greater than for amalgam (39% vs 29%). This proportion was anticipated to be 3:1 for posterior composite/amalgam in five years’ time. Most posterior restorations placed by students are composites (average 64%, ranging from 10 to 100%), with amalgam representing 19.5% of the restorations placed (ranging from 0%–50%).

This article focuses on dental composites with azole functional groups incorporated to affect their physicochemical and mechanical properties and antibacterial activity. Methods Dental composites were fabricated by embedding the functionalized imidazole and benzimidazole nanoparticles into a Bis-GMA/TEGDMA matrix to form the imidazole and benzimidazole dental composites series (I and B). The material was produced through hand blending of the monomer (50:50, wt%), filler (0–30, wt%), and initiator combination (CQ/EDMAB:0.8:1.6, wt%), and LED light-curing unit for 60 s. Results Using various characterization techniques, I and B series were validated. The dental composites' approximate solubility and sorption significances were evaluated by conducting experiments on specific dental composite formulations. Fenton reaction test was performed to determine the chemical stability of the dental composites. The mechanical properties of the dental composites were investigated. Finally, by testing cell growth in the presence of composites, their antibacterial activities were determined. Conclusions In this study, it was observed that the mechanical, physiochemical, and antibacterial properties of the functional azole-containing nanoparticles were positively improved by adding them to the structure of dental composites. These experimental results paved the way for the synthesized materials to be used in industrial applications. Clinical Significance Since the chemical, mechanical, and antimicrobial properties of dental composites containing 10% imidazole and benzimidazole functional nanoparticles are far superior, they constitute an excellent alternative for preventing dental caries and long-term use of dental composites.","","Bis-GMA, TEGDMA, Imidazole, Benzimidazole, SiO, Functional nanoparticles","",""

Methods Amalgam was placed into 140 hydroxyapatite disks and matured for 14-days in artificial saliva. The solution was replaced, and samples split into five groups of 28 immediately prior to MRI. One group had no exposure, and the remainder were exposed to either a 3T or 7T MRI scanner, each at high and low RF power. Mercury concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Groups were compared using one-way ANOVA, and two-way ANOVA for main effects/ interaction of field strength/ RF power. Results Mercury concentration was increased in the 7T groups (high/ low: 15.43/ 11.33 ng mL−1) and 3T high group (3.59) compared to control (2.44). MRI field strength significantly increased mercury release (p < .001) as did RF power (p = .030). At 3T, mercury release was 20.3 times lower than during maturation of dental amalgam, and for the average person an estimated 1.50 ng kg−1 of mercury might be released during one 3T investigation; this is substantially lower than the tolerable weekly intake of 4,000 ng kg−1. Conclusion Mercury release from amalgam shows a measurable increase following MRI, and the magnitude changes with magnetic field strength and RF power. The amount of mercury released is small compared to release during amalgam maturation. Amalgam mercury release during MRI is unlikely to be clinically meaningful and highly likely to remain below safe levels.","","Magnetic resonance imaging, Dental amalgam, Mercury, Dental materials, Mass spectrometry, Humans, Saliva","",""

Then, the HA-PDA-Ag-PDA filler was mixed into an adhesive at different mass fractions (0 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%) to prepare a functional adhesive. Antibacterial and mineralization tests were carried out, and the cytotoxicity of the functional adhesive against L929 fibroblasts was also examined. Results The SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD and FTIR characterizations confirmed the successful preparation of the HA-PDA-Ag filler. The 1 wt% and 2 wt% functional adhesives showed the strongest bacterial inhibition effect among all the samples (p < 0.05).

Study selection Randomized controlled studies with minimum 2 years follow-up, comparing different adhesive strategies and/or restorative materials in permanent teeth were included. Our outcome was the occurrence of secondary caries. Bayesian pairwise and network-meta-analysis were conducted. Data We included 50 trials; 19 assessing secondary caries depending on different adhesive strategies, 31 on restorative materials. Studies were published between 2005 and 2017, largely of unclear risk of bias, and included a mean of 40 (range: 8–90) participants and 46 (range: 14–200) placed restorations. Mean follow-up was 43 (range: 24–180) months. Secondary caries was a rare event; the majority of studies did not find any lesions. Network meta-analysis found great uncertainty. 3-step etch-and-rinse adhesives showed the lowest risk of secondary caries, 2-step etch-and-rinse the highest. For restorative materials, resin-modified glass ionomer showed the lowest risk of secondary caries. Most resin composites showed similar risks. Conclusion Data from randomized trials comparing different adhesive strategies or restorative materials are extremely scarce. The differences between materials were limited over the observational period of the included studies. The yielded rankings should be interpreted with caution. Clinical significance Despite often claimed to be a major complication of restorations, there is surprisingly little data on secondary caries from randomized trials.

The participants were provided 1269 full-mouth direct resin composite restorations (Clearfil AP-X) by 5 experienced operators, using the DSO-technique. Treatment resulted in an increase in the vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO). Failure was assessed at three levels. Frequencies of failure were analysed using Kaplan Meier survival curves and the effects of the relevant variables calculated with a multifactorial Cox regression (p < 0.05). Results Annual failure rates (for all levels of failure, ‘Level 3- ‘) of ≤ 2.2% and ≤ 2.9% were respectively reported for the anterior and posterior restorations with a mean observation time of 62.4 months.

Results A total of 1086 patients had at least one posterior composite placed between 2007 and 2018. This amounted to 3194 restorations placed of which 308 had a re-intervention within the 11-year period. For all restorations, the annual failure rate at 1 year was 5.73 %, at 5 years was 16.78 % and at 10 years was 18.74 %. A logistic regression showed that when compared to the least deprived 5th quintile, the most deprived 1st and 2nd quintiles were significantly less likely to have a re-intervention, being 49.2 % (p = 0.022) and 53.2 % (p = 0.031) less likely, respectively.

Studies that found a significant difference or that made clear recommendations towards the use of compomers were commonly rated with a high risk of bias. Conclusion Compomers are similar to other dental filling materials for the placement of direct restorations in primary teeth. Clinical significance The results of this umbrella review indicate a similar clinical performance of compomers compared to other materials containing a resin component for direct restoration in primary teeth. Therefore, the choice of restorative material will depend on multiple factors, such as clinician's skills/preferences, patients’ wishes, costs, and cavity type/location.","","Compomer, Primary teeth, Overview, Systematic review, Umbrella review","",""

The objectives of this study were to investigate a dual strategy of combining rnc gene-deletion for Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) with antibacterial dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) composite, and determine the effects of rnc gene-deletion alone, DMAHDM composite alone, and rnc-deletion plus DMAHDM composite, on biofilm growth and lactic acid production. Methods Parent S. mutans (UA159, ATCC 700610) and rnc-deleted S. mutans were used. DMAHDM was incorporated into a composite at mass fractions of 0%, 1.5%, and 3%. Gene expressions for biofilm formation and drug resistance were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Biofilms were grown on composite surfaces for 2 days. Live/dead, biomass, polysaccharide, metabolic activity (MTT), colony-forming units (CFU) and lactic acid production of biofilms were evaluated. Results Compared to the parent S. mutans, the rnc-deletion technique yielded significantly less biofilm biomass, polysaccharides, metabolic activity, CFU, and lactic acid for biofilms grown on control composite (p <  0.05). With no gene modification, the biofilm CFU was decreased by 5–6 logs at 3% DMAHDM, when compared to control composite group. The dual strategy of combining rnc-deletion with 3% DMAHDM composite achieved the strongest biofilm-inhibition, with the greatest reduction in CFU by 8 logs. The combination of rnc-deletion with 3% DMAHDM composite decreased the biofilm lactic acid production by 95% (p <  0.05). Conclusions The dual strategy of rnc-deletion plus DMAHDM composite produced synergistic effects and achieved the strongest biofilm-inhibition. This method has great potential to inhibit dental caries and is promising to reduce secondary caries and protect tooth structures.",""," gene modification, Dental composite, Dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate, Biofilm growth, Acid production, Recurrent caries","",""

Methods All live-born children in Pelotas, in 2004, were prospectively investigated and a representative sample was assessed for oral conditions at ages 5 and 12. The outcome was the quality of the restoration (satisfactory/unsatisfactory). Independent variables included socioeconomic, behavioral and oral health characteristics at the individual level and the size of cavity and material at the tooth level. Associations were tested using multilevel logistic regression models. Results A total of 1,000 participants and 249 restorations in the permanent dentition were examined. Most of the restorations were composites (73.5%), while only 6.8% were amalgam. After adjusted analyses, children whose parents received information on how to prevent their child from developing caries before reaching 5 years of age had 91.0% less chance of having an unsatisfactory restoration compared to children whose parents never received information (OR = 0.09; 95% CI 0.01–0.59). Also, the chances of presenting unsatisfactory restorations were 5.3 higher in children at high-risk for untreated dental caries in the permanent dentition, in comparison with children at low risk (OR = 5.32; 95% CI 1.07–26.6). Conclusions Low-risk for untreated dental caries and having received information on preventing dental caries, reduced the chance of presenting failed restorations, showing that factors related to individuals play an important role in the quality of restorations. Clinical significance Our findings highlight the role that individual-related factors play in restoration longevity in children, reinforcing the need for a patient-centered approach in restorative dentistry.","","Dental restorations, Dental restoration failure, Cohort studies, Child, Posterior teeth, Longevity","",""

Both materials were applied with or without their respective resinous coating, and were compared with a conventional GIC (Ketac Fil) and a hybrid composite resin (CR; G-ænial Posterior). Methods 78 standardized occlusal Class I cavities were restored with the various materials (n = 13 per group). Before and after chewing simulation (30,000 cycles at 40 N), each sample underwent optical scanning procedures (Omnicam). A comparison of the total wear using a fluorescence-aided identification technique (OraCheck) followed, and differences (α = 5%) between groups were compared by means of MANOVA. Results Regarding the wear rates of hvGIC and ghRS, no differences could be observed (p > .050), and this was not affected by the resinous coating. All hvGIC and ghRS restorations showed significantly higher abrasive wear than CR (p < .001), while the conventional GIC displayed a significant underperformance compared with any other material (p < .001). Conclusions Resinous coating of hvGIC or ghRS does not appear to exert an effective long-term protection against advanced abrasive wear. Compared to the conventional GIC showing a considerable substance loss, both hvGIC and ghRS materials revealed an improved abrasion resistance, but clearly failed to meet the excellent values of the CR. Clinical Significance Occlusal loading should be carefully considered when using hvGIC or ghRS as amalgam (or composite resin) alternatives for the restoration of posterior teeth.","","Abrasion, Chewing simulation, Equia, Glass hybrid restorative system, Glass ionomer cement, High-viscosity glass ionomer cement, OraCheck, Resinous coating, Wear","",""
