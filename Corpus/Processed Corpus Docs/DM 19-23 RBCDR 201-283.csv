Methods The literature search was conducted based on the question: “What is the state-of-the-art of available restorative materials for 3D printing based on stereolithography?"" Online search was conducted in three databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) with no restriction for year of publication. Data are reported based on PRISMA, including publication details such as authors and their countries, year and journal of publication, and study design. The synthesis is focused on describing the dental restorative materials and properties evaluated, applied methods, 3D printers used and clinical applicability. Results Studies that fit the inclusion criteria were performed in Asia (21), Europe (16) and USA (10), mostly using polymer-based restorative materials (38) for 3D printing constructs. Stereolithographic-printed ceramic-based restorative structures were evaluated by 9 studies. Many studies reported on dimensional accuracy (14), strength (11) and surface morphology (9) of the printed structures. Antibacterial response, cytotoxicity, internal and marginal fit, fracture and wear resistance, density, viscosity, elastic modulus, hardness, structural shrinkage and reliability, degree of conversion, layer cure depth, fatigue, and color were also evaluated by the included studies. Many of them (11) published a proof of concept as an attempt to demonstrate the clinical feasibility and applicability of the technology to print restorative materials, but only 5 studies actually applied the 3D printed restorative structures in patients, which highlights an increasing interest but limited early-stage translation. Significance The fast expansion of stereolithographic-based 3D printing has been impressive and represents a great technological progress with significant disruptive potential. Dentistry has demonstrated an incredible willingness to adapt materials, methods and workflows to this promising digital technology. However, esthetic appearance, wear resistance, wet strength and dimensional accuracy are the main current clinical limitations restricting the progression to functional part production with 3D printing, which may explain the absence of clinical trials and reports on permanent/definitive dental restorative materials and structures.","3D printing, Dentistry, Dental materials"

Methods Non-carious extracted molars were assigned to two groups, cut into slabs exposing middle/deep dentin, etched and bonded with Adper Scotchbond 1XT (SB1XT) with or without 0.2% CHX aqueous solution pretreatment. Composite build-ups were made, and the specimens were cut in 1-mm thick bonded sticks. In situ zymography was performed on freshly prepared specimens (T0) and specimens aged for 10 years (T10-yr) at 37°C in artificial saliva, to investigate endogenous gelatinolytic activity within the HL. At T10-yr, specimens were also decalcified and embedded in epoxy resin for TEM analysis. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was performed at T0 and T10-yr to evaluate the chemical profiles in intertubular dentin and the HL. Results In situ zymography showed less pronounced enzymatic activity in the CHX-pretreated group (p<0.05) regardless of aging, maintaining a similar level of fluorescence at T0 and T10-yr (p>0.05). TEM results showed that 98% of the HL had been degraded in the control group, while 95% of the HL was intact in the experimental group. Moreover, all the Raman spectra peaks assigned to CHX could be identified only in the CHX-pretreated group (T0 and T10-yr). Significance In vitro, CHX remains in the HL after 10 years with its inhibitory effect preserved. This may be the underlying factor for HL preservation after this long aging period.","Hybrid layer, Dentin bonding agents, MMPs inhibitors, aging, zymography, TEM, Raman spectroscopy"

Methods Two three-step and one two-step ER adhesives and two two-step and two single-step SE adhesives were used for comparison with seven universal adhesives in ER mode and SE mode, respectively. Bonded surfaces with bovine teeth were longitudinally sectioned and mirror-polished. Half of the samples were treated with HCl and NaOCl solutions. The interfaces were subjected to argon ion beam etching and then observed by scanning electron microscopy. Results The thickness of the adhesive layer (AL) of most of the seven universal adhesives and single-step SE adhesives was similar. Universal adhesives in SE mode formed a hybrid smear layer as a high-density zone between the AL and dentin. The thickness of the hybrid layer (HL) of the universal adhesives in ER mode was ∼1–2μm, with a high-density zone (reaction layer [RL]) below the HL. Conclusion The morphological features of most universal adhesives in SE mode and single-step SE adhesives are similar. Although resin–dentin interfaces of universal adhesives in ER mode resemble those of ER adhesives, universal adhesives have a distinctive feature, an RL. Significance The RL might be a sign of chemical bonding even when using universal adhesives in ER mode.","Universal adhesive, Resin–dentin interface, SEM observation, Etch-&-rinse adhesive system, Self-etch adhesive system"

Methods Eighty #8 typodonts were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 20 each). They were sectioned to simulate crown fracture, and reattached with a self-etch adhesive and a resin composite. The preparation for each group was: (1) no chamfer; (2) buccal chamfer; (3) lingual chamfer; and (4) circumferential chamfer. Forty-eight human lower incisors were grouped and prepared similarly (n = 12 each). These teeth were tested for their load capacity under a lingual load on a universal testing machine. Finite element models were used to examine the stresses on the reattached surfaces to help interpret the experimental results. Results The buccal chamfer did not increase the load capacity when compared with the no-chamfer group. Lingual and circumferential chamfers respectively increased the fracture load by 36.9% and 32.3% in typodonts, and 78.5% and 33.3% in human incisors. The increase was statistically significant (p < 0.05). A higher fracture load tended to be accompanied by a larger area of deflected cohesive fracture. Finite element analysis showed that lingual and circumferential chamfers reduced the fracture-causing tensile stress at the lingual margin of the reattachment interface by approximately 70% and 60%, respectively, in human upper incisors. Significance It was the joint design, and not the size of the bond area, that affected the load capacity of reattached incisors. Among the preparations considered, only those with a lingual chamfer could increase the load capacity of reattached incisors under a lingual load.","Incisor fracture, Fragment, Reattachment, Chamfer, Bevel, Retention, Load capacity, Resistance, Bond area"

The main printable materials and most common technologies are also addressed, underlining their advantages and main drawbacks. Methods Online databases (Web of knowledge, Science Direct, PubMed) were consulted on this topic. Published work from 2008 to 2018 was collected, analyzed and the relevant papers were selected for inclusion on this review. Results Ceramic materials are broadly used in dentistry to restore/replace damaged or missing teeth, due to their biocompatibility, chemical stability and mechanical and aesthetic properties. However, there are several unmet challenges regarding their processing and performance. Due to their brittleness nature, a very tight control of the manufacturing process is needed to obtain dental pieces with adequate mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing (AM) is an emerging technology that constitutes an interesting and viable manufacturing alternative to the conventional subtractive methods. AM enables the production of customized complex 3D parts in a more sustainable and less expensive way. AM of ceramics can be achieved with an extensive variety of methods. Significance There is no perfect technology for all materials/applications, capable alone of fulfilling all the specificities and necessities of every patient. Although very promising, AM of ceramic dental materials remains understudied and further work is required to make it a widespread technology in dentistry.","Additive manufacturing, 3D printing, Ceramics, Dentistry, Dental prosthesis"

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of MTP on the mechanical behavior, reliability and translucency of posterior monolithic ceramic crowns. Methods Dentin analogues were machined using two preparation designs (0.5 or 1 mm reduction) to receive first molar crowns in order to evaluate the monolithic crown performance. Next, 126 crowns were divided (21/g) according to the material (High translucent zirconia – YZHT, Zirconia reinforced lithium silicate – ZLS and Hybrid ceramic – HC) and thickness (0.5 or 1 mm). Tensile stress concentration was calculated using the finite element method. The crowns were adhesivelly cemented and step stress fatigued to calculate reliability for missions at 600 and 1000 N. Translucency was analyzed in 10 discs of each material and thickness. Results Higher stress concentration was found in thinner crowns and those with higher elastic modulus. YZHT crowns were suspended when fatigue reached 1500 N load, thus 1-parameter Weibull was used to analyze the data. Reliability was only affected by thickness at 1000 N. ZLS.5 showed lower survival than HC.5, which was similar to the groups that presented 100% survival. YZHT showed the highest strength and data scattering. ZLS1 (22.3 ± 1.4) presented higher translucency than HC1 (19.2 ± 0.6) and YZHT1 (12.0 ± 2.9), whereas ZLS.5 and HC.5 were similar to each other (26.5 ± 2.3, 26.7 ± 2.2) and superior to YZHT.5 (12.7 ± 1.2). Significance HC.5 combined high reliability and translucency with low stress concentration, yielding better crown performance and tooth preservation.","Fatigue, Reliability, Monolithic crowns, Dental materials, Tooth wear"

Methods GIC specimens (n=180) which contained DMADDM (0wt.%, 1.1wt.% or 2.2wt.%) were prepared. The mechanical properties surface roughness, microhardness and the surface charge density of ammonium groups were measured before and after water aging for 3 and 6months at 37°C. Further six months aged specimens (n=216) were worn by 6 volunteers in their oral cavities for 24h and 72h. Biofilm formation was analyzed and rated by fluorescence microscopy (FM) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biofilm viability was analyzed by FM. Results Water aging did not show any adverse effects on the surface roughness and hardness of the material. The surface charge density of the GIC samples containing DMADDM decreased due to the aging procedure, however, was still higher than that of the GIC without DMADDM. In situ biofilm formation was significantly reduced after 24h on DMADDM containing GIC (p<0.05). FM results showed a higher ratio of red/green fluorescence on GIC-DMADDM samples. Significance Incorporating DMADDM into GIC affected the material properties in a tolerable manner even after 6months of storage in water. The new GIC is a promising material to affect the biofilm formation on the surface of restorations.","Biofilms, Glass ionomer cements, Dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate, Anti-bacterial agents, Long term water aging, Mechanical properties"

Incomplete curing of resins leads to elution of HEMA, which may come in contact with different cells in oral tissues. We aimed to analyze the impact of HEMA on the transcription of genes participating in detoxification of oxidative stress, inflammatory response and organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) using human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and human oral keratinocytes (OKF6/TERT2). Methods Cells were grown in monolayer cultures and treated with different HEMA concentrations (0.5–10mM). H33342 and LDH assays were used to determine HEMA-caused cytotoxicity. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze mRNA expression of four genes related to oxidative stress and five genes each related to inflammation and organization of the ECM. Results HEMA caused similar concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Analysis of the transcription showed that genes were regulated in both cell types after HEMA treatment. Genes related to defense against oxidative stress were transcriptionally induced, genes related to inflammation were mainly reduced and genes related to the organization of the ECM were differentially modulated. Significance We analyzed concurrent and HEMA-dependent differential expression of 14 important genes, which have a special significance for cellular processes that are linked to redox and tissue homeostasis. The results suggest that HEMA has an impact on cellular redox-homeostasis with potential impairment of inflammatory responses and of the organization of the ECM in human gingival fibroblasts and oral keratinocytes as first target cells of eluted HEMA.","HEMA, Oral keratinocytes, Gingival fibroblasts, Gene expression, Oxidative stress, Inflammation, ECM"

Objectives In this study, a highly functionalized GelMA hydrogel was synthesized and assessed for degree of functionalization. As the proposed GelMA hydrogel was coupled to a visible-light photoinitiator, we hypothesized it might serve as base to formulate a model dentin primer for application in restorative dentistry. Methods GelMA was mixed with photoinitiator lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP), photopolymerized for 0–40 s using a dental light-curing device and tested for extrudability, degree of photo-crosslinking (DPxlink), water sorption/solubility/swelling (WS/SL/SW) and apparent modulus of elasticity (AE). Model dentin primer was prepared by mixing GelMA+LAP with a primer of a commercial three-step etch-and-rinse adhesive. After application of GelMA-based primer to acid-etched dentin, samples were bonded with correspondent adhesive agent, photopolymerized and had their immediate bond strength compared to control samples primed and bonded with the same commercial material. Results Extrudability of hydrogel was confirmed using a microsyringe to write the acronym “CDMI”. DPxlink of GelMA+LAP changed significantly as a function of photopolymerization time (20 s < 30 s ≤ 40 s). WS, SL and SW were significantly reduced in hydrogels polymerized for 30 and 40 s. AE of hydrogels varied significantly as a function of photopolymerization time (20 s < 30 s ≤ 40 s; 20 s ‡ 40 s). Bond strength of dentin primed with GelMA-based primer was lower (∼29.3 MPa) but not significantly of that of control (∼34.6 MPa). Conclusions Optimization of a GelMA-based dentin primers can lead to the development of promising biomimetic adhesives for dentin rehabilitation.","Hydrogels, Model bonding agents, Methacrylamides, Gelatin, Dentin, Extracellular matrix"

During SCR, residual carious dentin is left behind and sealed beneath the restoration. The biomechanical effects of such residual lesions on the restored tooth remain unclear and were assessed using finite element modeling (FEM). Methods Based on μ-CT images of a healthy permanent human third molar, we developed five finite element models. Generic class I and II cavity restorations were modeled where residual lesions of variable sizes were either left or fully removed on occlusal and proximal surfaces. The cavities were restored with adhesive composite. All 3D-FE models were compared with a model of a healthy, non-treated molar. A vertical load of 100 N was applied onto the occlusal surface. Results Regardless of the lesion size, in molars with occlusal lesions higher mean stresses were predicted along the filling-lesion interface than in all other models. The smallest occlusal lesion (Ø1 = 1 mm) resulted in the highest maximum stresses at the filling-lesion interface with large stress concentrations at the filling walls indicating failure risk. In conclusion, lesion site and extent are influencing parameters affecting the filling-lesion interactions and thus the biomechanical behavior of the tooth after SCR. Significance Retaining carious lesions around the pulpal floor affects the deformation and stress states in tooth-filling complexes. The higher stresses observed in molars with occlusal lesions may affect restoration stability and longevity. Suprisingly, more extended occlusal lesions may provide a more favorable tooth performance than less extended ones. In contrast, in molars with proximal lesions the residual lesion had only limited effect on the tooth’s biomechanical condition.","Selective caries removal, Partial caries removal, Occlusal and proximal caries lesion, Filling, Interfacial stresses, Tooth-filling complex, Finite element modeling, Tooth biomechanics"

As the preferred bonding mode differs for enamel versus dentin, a universal conditioner for both enamel and dentin in replacement of the relatively aggressive phosphoric-acid etchant remains desirable. This study aimed to test if a metal salt-based etchant (ZrO(NO3)2) provides as durable bonding to dentin as a classic E&R or SE bonding mode Methods Before applying the UA Adhese Universal (‘AdU’; Ivoclar Vivadent) to bur-cut dentin of 24 teeth (n = 8), dentin was conditioned with either (1) an experimental metal salt-based conditioner (‘ZON’; Ivoclar Vivadent) or (2) 37% phosphoric acid (Total Etch gel, Ivoclar Vivadent), representing a classic ‘E&R′ mode; (3) a third experimental group involved AdU applied in SE mode. Bonding effectiveness was determined in terms of immediate (‘1w’) and aged (‘50k’ TC) micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) to bur-cut dentin. Adhesive-conditioned dentin interfacial interactions were characterized by S/TEM. Results Linear mixed-effects modeling revealed significantly higher immediate μTBS to dentin of ZON_AdU than E&R_AdU, while ZON_AdU performed not significantly different from SE_AdU. No significant differences were found between the three experimental groups after 50k TC (aged μTBS). S/TEM disclosed less exposure of dentinal collagen fibrils when AdU was bonded upon ZON etching than when applied in E&R mode. Moreover, ZON resulted in more hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals remaining at the bottom of the hybrid layer, while dentinal tubule orifices remained nearly fully closed, by which hardly any resin tags were formed. Significance The alternative metal salt-based conditioner revealed at dentin a more HAp-protected hybrid layer with less exposure of collagen fibrils, while a comparable bond strength was obtained to that with a phosphoric-acid E&R as well as with an SE (no conditioner) bonding mode. These findings confirm that the metal salt-based conditioner can be considered as a suitable alternative (enamel/)dentin conditioner to classic phosphoric acid employed in an E&R bonding mode.","Bonding, Etchants, Phosphoric acid, Adhesive, TEM"

The effect of DCC on the dentinal MMP activity was also investigated by means of in-situ zymography. Methods Eighty freshly extracted human molars were sectioned to expose mid-coronal dentin surfaces. The teeth were assigned to one of the following groups, according to the dentin surface priming/adhesive approach: (G1): DCC pre-treatment and Scotchbond Universal (SBU) in ER mode; (G2): SBU in ER mode; (G3): DCC pretreatment and SBU in SE mode; (G4): SBU in SE mode. μTBS test was performed immediately (T0) or after 1-year aging (T12) in artificial saliva. Ten additional teeth per group were prepared for nanoleakage evaluation (N = 5) and for in-situ zymography (N = 5). Results Three-factor analysis of variance revealed significant difference for the variables DCC pretreatment, application mode and aging (p < 0.05) for both microtensile bond strength testing and in-situ zymography. Nanoleakage analysis revealed reduced marginal infiltration of DCC experimental groups both at T0 and T12.

Although the dentin-bonding promoting effect of MDP has been well demonstrated, the mechanisms by which it benefits the stably of collagen within the adhesive–dentin hybrid layer are not currently fully understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the roles of MDP and its calcium salt in preserving the adhesive–dentin hybrid layer. Methods MDP-conditioned collagen was investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, and molecular docking. The structural changes to the dentin surface upon acid-etching and MDP-conditioning were observed by SEM. X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to investigate the chemical interactions between MDP and HAp. The collagen-protecting effects of MDP and its Ca salt were investigated using in-situ zymography, rhMMP-9 colorimetric assay, hydroxyproline assay, and molecular docking. Results MDP forms a stable collagen-phosphate complex through hydrogen bonding with the collagen in dentin. Furthermore, it generates MDP-Ca salts that are deposited on the dentin collagen scaffold, protecting it from degradation. Moreover, both free MDP and the MDP-Ca salt inhibit matrix metallopeptidase and exogenous proteases, with the inhibitory effect of the calcium salt being significantly stronger than that of the free form. Significance MDP-based adhesives preserve the collagen within the hybrid layer by simultaneously improving collagen’s resistance to exogenous enzymes and inhibiting MMP activity, both of which contribute to the longevity of dentin–resin bonding.","10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate, Matrix metalloproteinase, Collagen, Exogenous protease, Dentin bonding"

Methods Human molars were sectioned into 7-µm-thick dentin films, demineralized, and assigned to six groups: control with/without PA modification, H3PO4-treated collagen with/without PA modification, enzyme-treated collagen with/without PA modification. PA modification involved immersing collagen films in 0.65% PA for 30 s. H3PO4 and enzyme treatments were used to experimentally induce collagen denaturation, which was quantitated by fluorescence intensity (FI) from the fluorescently-conjugated-CHP (F-CHP) staining (n = 4). FTIR was used to characterize collagen structures. All groups were subject to collagenase digestion to test the bio-stabilization effect of PA on denatured collagen using weight loss analysis and hydroxyproline assay (n = 6). Data were analyzed using two-factor ANOVA and Games-Howell post hoc tests (α = 0.05). Results FTIR showed collagen secondary structural changes after denaturation treatments and confirmed the incorporation and cross-linking of PA in control and treated collagen. F-CHP staining indicated high-degree, medium-degree, and low-degree collagen denaturation from H3PO4-treatment (FI = 83.22), enzyme-treatment (FI = 36.54), and control (FI = 6.01) respectively. PA modification significantly reduced the weight loss and hydroxyproline release of all groups after digestion (p < 0.0001), with the results correlated with FI values at r = 0.96–0.98. Significance A molecular method CHP is introduced as a sensitive technique to quantitate dentin collagen denaturation for the first time. PA modification is shown to effectively stabilize denatured collagen against collagenase digestion, with the stabilization effect negatively associated with the collagen denaturation degree.","Dentin collagen denaturation, Collagen hybridizing peptide, Proanthocyanidins, Cross-linking, Collagen bio-stabilization, FTIR, Weight loss, Hydroxyproline assay"

Methods Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic discs (IPS Emax Press, Ivoclar Vivadent) were mirror polished, etched with 9% HF for 20 s and rinsed 1 min under water. Two post-etching cleaning were compared: (1) no additional cleaning and (2) immersion in water ultrasonic bath for 4 min. Morphology evolution of the surfaces was carried out by scanning electron microscopy. Chemical changes were studied using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Nano Auger Electron Spectroscopy analyses. Identification of the compounds formed with fluorine was based on by High Resolution Transmission Tlectronic Microscopy . Results Residues left on the surface of the discs after etching, the fluorine salts, were eliminated after the ultrasonic bath cleaning. However, analyses showed presence of fluorine on the lithium disilicate needles associated among others with the lithium. HR-TEM validates the presence of Li2SiF6 crystallized phased. A mechanism to explain silane bonding when Li2SiF6 phase is formed on the Li2Si2O5 needles, is proposed. Significance HF-etching leads to the formation of lithium and fluorine contain LiSi2F6 nano-precipitates on the Li2Si2O5 needles which helps to improve the bonding with silane.","Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic, HF-etching, Silane, Bonding, Microstructure"

Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) is a widely used co-monomer in restorative dentistry with adverse effects on cellular metabolism. Aim of this study was to analyze the impact of TEGDMA on the angiogenic differentiation potential of DPSCs. Methods DPSCs were characterized by flow cytometry. Short-term (max. 72h) cytotoxicity of TEGDMA was assessed by MTT assay. To evaluate TEGDMA effects on angiogenic differentiation, DPSCs were cultivated in angiogenic differentiation medium (ADM) in the presence or absence of short-term non-toxic TEGDMA concentrations (0.1mM and 0.25mM). Subsequently, angiogenic differentiation was analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA markers and in vitro spheroid sprouting assays. Results DPSCs treated with 0.25mM TEGDMA revealed downregulation of angiogenesis-related marker genes PECAM1 (max. 3.8-fold), VEGF-A (max. 2.4-fold) and FLT1 (max. 2.9-fold) compared to respective untreated control. In addition, a reduction of the sprouting potential of DPSCs cultured in the presence of 0.25mM TEGDMA was detectable. Larger spheroidal structures were detectable in the untreated control in comparison to cells treated with 0.25mM TEGDMA. In contrast, TEGDMA at 0.1mM was not affecting angiogenic potential in the investigated time period (up to 28 days). Significance The results of the present study show that TEGDMA concentration dependently impair the angiogenic differentiation potential of DPSCs and may affect wound healing and the formation of granulation tissue.","TEGDMA, Dental pulp stem cells, Angiogenic differentiation, Gene expression, Spheroid sprouting"

Methods Enamel and dentin samples from 20 human teeth (10 for enamel; 10 for dentin) were divided into a control group without treatment and test samples with BIMIN treatment. Quantitative analysis of tissue penetration of fluoride, phosphate, and calcium was performed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Mineralization depth was measured by Raman spectroscopy probing the symmetric valence vibration near 960cm−1 as a marker for crystallinity. EDX data was statistically analyzed using a paired t-test and Raman data was analyzed using the Student’s t-test. Results EDX analysis demonstrated a penetration depth of fluoride of 4.10±3.32μm in enamel and 4.31±2.67μm in dentin. Calcium infiltrated into enamel 2.65±0.64μm and into dentin 5.58±1.63μm, while the penetration depths for phosphate were 4.83±2.81μm for enamel and 6.75±3.25μm for dentin.

Methods Two commercial adhesives were tested: a MDP-free adhesive (Single Bond 2, SB2) and a MDP-containing adhesive (Single Bond Universal, SBU). Teeth were randomly assigned to six groups and tested for micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS): Ctr, direct bonding with SB2; CHX, CHX conditioning and SB2; MDP, MDP conditioning and SB2; CHX+MDP, combined CHX and MDP conditioning and SB2; SBU, direct bonding with SBU; CHX+SBU, CHX conditioning and SBU. The potential interaction of CHX and MDP was assessed by measuring nanoleakage, in situ zymography, and chemoanalytic characterization via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Specimens for μTBS and nanoleakage tests were first subjected to water storage for 24h or 6 months. Results The initial μTBS values of the Ctr and CHX groups were significantly lower than those of the other four groups (P<0.05). Water storage for 6 months significantly weakened all groups (P<0.05), with the Ctr group showing the lowest μTBS. This group also showed more obvious nanoleakage than the other five groups. In situ zymography revealed that the Ctr group showed the strongest fluorescence and that the CHX+MDP group showed greater fluorescence than either CHX or MDP group. FTIR, XPS, and NMR indicated that MDP can interact with hydroxyapatite. NMR detected no Ca2+ salt peak for MDP when it was combined with CHX. Significance The application of either CHX or MDP alone can improve dentin bond durability.

The aim of this study was to formulate a novel class of dental bio-interactive restorative material (pRMGIC) based on resin-modified glass-ionomer cements via the inclusion of an organophosphorus monomer, ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate, with a potential to improve the mechanical properties and also function as a reparative restorative material. Methods pRMGIC was formulated with modification of the resin phase by forming mixes of ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate (EGMP; 0–40%wt) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate monomer into the liquid phase of a RMGIC (Fuji II LC, GC Corp.). The physical properties of the cements were determined including setting characteristics, compressive strength and modulus (CS &CM), microhardness (MH) and biaxial flexural strength (BFS). Fluid uptake and fluoride release were assessed up to 60 days storage. Adhesion to sound dentine was measured using micro-tensile bond strength and surface integrity was analysed using SEM coupled with EDX. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests. Results The pRMGIC cements exhibited an increase in working time with increasing EGMP concentration however were within the limits of standard clinical requirements. Although the compressive strength of pRMGIC cements were comparable to control cements in the early stages of maturation, the higher EGMP-containing cements (EGMP30 and 40) exhibited significantly greater values (p < 0.05) after 4 weeks storage (141.0 ± 9 and 140.4 ± 8 MPa, respectively), in comparison to EGMP0 (128.8 ± 7 MPa). A dramatic two fold increase in biaxial flexural strength (p < 0.001) was observed for the pRMGIC’s. Furthermore, the ability to decalcify tooth apatite resulted in enhanced interfacial adhesion due to chelation with calcium ions of tooth apatite. The inclusion of EGMP encouraged formation of reinforcing complexes within the RMGIC, thus improving physical properties, decreasing solubility and lower fluoride release. A dense microstructure was observed with increasing EGMP content. Significance A novel universal bio-interactive adhesive repair material will enable clinicians to offer more effective repair of the tooth-restoration complex, thus future treatments will benefit both patient and a severely constrained healthcare budget.","Ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate, Resin modified glass ionomer cements, Adhesive dental cements, Dental reparative biomaterial, Minimally invasive dentistry"

This effect decreases the mechanical properties of methacrylate-based materials. Methods The ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) or novel ethylene glycol ethyl methacrylate (EGEMA) discs were prepared using 40 µL of the curing mixture containing photo/co-initiators for 40 s in a PTFE mold at 1000 mW/cm2. The degree of conversion was used as a quality control measure for the prepared discs, followed by physical, mechanical, and chemical characterization of discs properties before and after cholesterol esterase treatment. Results After 9 weeks of standardized cholesterol esterase (CEase) exposure, EGDMA discs showed exponential loss of material (p = 0.0296), strength (p = 0.0014) and increased water sorption (p = 0.0002) compared to EGEMA discs. We integrated a degradation prediction pathway system to LC/MS and GC/MS analyses to elucidate the degradation by-products of both EGEMA and EGDMA polymers. GC/MS analysis demonstrated that the esterase catalysis was directed to central polymer backbone breakage, producing ethylene glycol, for EGDMA, and to side chain breakage, producing ethanol, for EGEMA. The flipped external ester group linkage design is attributed to EGEMA showing higher resistance to esterase biodegradation and changes in mechanical and physical properties than EGDMA. Significance EGEMA is a potential substitute for common macromer diluents, such as EGDMA, based on its resistance to biodegradation effects. This work inspires the flipped external group design to be applied to analogs of current larger, hydrophobic strength bearing macromers used in future dental material formulations.","Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, Dental composite, Enzymatic degradation, Degradable linkage, Polymer backbone preservation"

A single layer collagen mineralization/demineralization model was designed to visualize extrafibrillar demineralization in detail. Dentin surfaces of human third molars were conditioned with 3 % SCMC or 37 % phosphoric acid (PA). The morphology, composition, and mechanical properties of conditioned dentin from each group were characterized. To evaluate dentin bonding performance, SCMC- and PA- conditioned dentin were applied with adhesive restoration using the dry-bonding technique.

The mechanical properties of SCMC-conditioned dentin were largely preserved. Compared with PA, SCMC conditioning produced greater MTBS values and less nanoleakage expression after aging. Endogenous gelatinolytic activity was suppressed in SCMC-conditioned dentin. In addition to being nontoxic, the inhibition of rhMMP-2 by SCMC was confirmed to be dose-dependent. Significance From the perspective of minimal intervention, the SCMC-based extrafibrillar demineralization conditioner could improve dentin bonding durability, suggesting a promising strategy to extend the service life of adhesive restorations.","Dentin bonding, Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, Extrafibrillar demineralization, Matrix metalloproteinases"

Nevertheless, HEMA promotes water sorption and hydrolysis at adhesive interfaces, hereby affecting long-term bonding to dentin. This study investigated if two acrylamide monomers could replace HEMA in an UA formulation applied in etch-and-rinse (2E&R) and self-etch (1SE) bonding mode. Methods Four experimental UAs were bonded to bur-cut dentin. In addition to 12 wt% 10-MDP, 25 wt% Bis-GMA and 10 wt% TEGDMA as common monomer composition, 20 %wt ethanol and 15 %wt water as solvent, and 3 wt% polymerization-related additives, the four formulations solely differed for either the acrylamide cross-linker monomer ‘FAM-201′ as TEGDMA alternative and HEMA replacement, the hydroxyethyl acrylamide monomer ‘HEAA’ as HEMA alternative, HEMA (‘HEMA+’), or extra TEGDMA in a HEMA-free control (‘HEMA-’), all added in a 15 wt% concentration. The split-tooth study design involved application in 2E&R mode on one tooth half versus 1SE mode on the corresponding half. Micro-tensile bond strength of half of the micro-specimens was measured upon 1-week distilled water storage (‘immediate’ 1w μTBS), with the other half measured after additional 6-month storage (‘aged’ 6 m μTBS). Statistics involved linear mixed-effects (LME) modelling (p < .05). Additionally, interfacial TEM characterization, thin-film (TF) XRD surface analysis, LogP determination, and a cytotoxicity assay were carried out. Results FAM-201 revealed significantly higher μTBS than HEMA+ at 1w and 6 m when applied both in E&R and SE bonding modes. HEAA’s μTBS was significantly lower than that of HEMA+ at 1w when applied in SE mode. TF-XRD and TEM revealed similar chemical and ultrastructural interfacial characterization, including stable 10-MDP_Ca salt nano-layering. FAM-201 was least cytotoxic and presented with an intermediary LogP, while HEAA presented with the highest LogP, indicating high hydrophilicity and water-sorption sensitivity. Significance The acrylamide co-monomer FAM-201 could replace HEMA in an UA formulation, while HEAA not.","HEMA, Durability, Acrylamides, Linear mixed-effects model (LME), TEM, Bond strength"

Methods Commercially available GICs (Maxxion, Vidrion R, Vitro Molar, Ketac Molar Easy Mix and Fuji Gold Label 9) were reinforced with CNs (0.2% by weight). The microstructure of CNs and of CN-modified GICs were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while chemical characterization was by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Ten specimens each of the unmodified (control) and CN-modified materials (test materials) were prepared for CS and DTS testing. For the fluoride release evaluation, separate specimens (n=10) of each test and control material were made. The results obtained were submitted to the t-test (p<0.05). Results The CN reinforcement significantly improved the mechanical properties and significantly increased the F− release of all GICs (p<0.05). The GICs with CNs showed a fibrillar aggregate of nanoparticles interspersed in the matrix. The compounds with CNs showed a higher amount of C compared to the controls due to the organic nature of the CNs.

However, much controversy remains about the safe use and cytotoxic effects of different groups of dental adhesives. The present study performed a systematic review to identify the answer to the following question: are self-etch adhesives more cytotoxic than those employing the etch-and-rinse system? Methods This systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement; a quality assessment for in vitro studies was conducted using the ToxRTool. Specific search strategies were developed and performed in the electronic databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS/BBO. After removal of duplicated studies and application of the exclusion criteria, ten eligible articles were selected and submitted to a qualitative descriptive analysis comparing both groups of dental adhesives. Most in vitro test systems employed pulp cells or gingival fibroblasts. Results The methodologies presented great variability regarding the exposure to the test materials. Only four studies assessed the role of the degree of conversion of the materials in their toxicity, with conflicting results. Significance While the lack of methodological standardization among the studies still hinders the establishment of a relationship between type of dental adhesive and toxicity, studies employing dentin barrier systems indicate greater cytotoxicity for etch-and-rinse adhesives.","Systematic review, Dental materials, In vitro techniques, Adhesive dentistry"

Methods One polywave light-emitting-diode (LED) LCU (Bluephase Style, Ivoclar Vivadent AG) was used with two different light guides: a regular tip (RT, 1010 mW/cm2 emittance) and a homogenizer tip (HT, 946 mW/cm2 emittance). The emission spectra and beam profiles were measured from both light guides. Extracted third molars were prepared for μTBS evaluation using two adhesive systems: Excite F (EXF) and Adhese Universal (ADU). Bond strength was calculated for each specimen (n = 10) at locations that correlated with the output of the two LED chips emitting blue (455 nm) and the one chip that emitted violet light (409 nm) after 24-hs and after one-year water-storage. The μTBS was analyzed using a four-way analysis of variance (factors: adhesive system, light guide, LED wavelength, and storage time) and post-hoc Tukey test (α = 0.05). Results EXF always delivered a higher μTBS than ADU (p < 0.0001), with the μTBS of ADU being about 20% lower than EXF. The light guide (p = 0.0259) and storage time (p = 0.0009) significantly influenced the μTBS. The LED wavelengths had no influence on the μTBS (p > 0.05). Significance Homogeneity of the emitted light beam was associated with higher 24-h μTBS to dentin, regardless of the adhesive tested. Also, differences in the composition of adhesives can affect their compatibility with restorative composites and their ability to maintain bonding over one year.","Light curing of dental adhesives, Adhesion, Dental photoinitiator, Dental curing light, Operative dentistry, Dental bonding"

Methods The experimental orthodontic adhesives were formulated with methacrylate monomers, photoinitiators and silica colloidal. The ionic liquid BMIM.NTf2 was synthesized and characterized. BMIM.NTf2 was added at 5 (G5%), 10 (G10%) and 15 (G15%) wt.%. One group contained no BMIM.NTf2 to function as control (GCtrl). The adhesives were evaluated for polymerization kinetics, degree of conversion (DC), Knoop hardness and softening in solvent, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), shear bond strength (SBS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity. Results BMI.NTf2 showed the characteristic chemical peaks. The polymerization kinetics were different among the groups. G10% and G15% showed higher DC (p < 0.05). G5% and GCtrl had no differences for softening in solvent (p > 0.05). There were no differences for UTS (p > 0.05) and SBS (p > 0.05). TGA showed one different peak for G15%.

Methods Two-step self-etching adhesive systems containing 5, 10, and 20 wt.% of 45S5 and NbG bioactive glasses were developed. An experimental adhesive without microparticles and a commercial adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond) were used as control groups. The materials were evaluated for their degree of conversion (DC%), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), softening in solvent, radiopacity, sorption and solubility, alkalizing activity (pH), ionic release, and bioactivity. μTBS and NL were evaluated after 24 h and 1 year of storage. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and post-Holm-Sidak tests (α = 0.05). Results The addition of the two bioactive glasses did not change the values of the degree of conversion, ultimate tensile strength, and softening in solvent. The adhesive system containing 20% NbG showed the highest radiopacity. The incorporation of 45S5 increased water sorption and solubility, raised the pH, and allowed the release of large amounts of calcium. After 28 days of immersion in simulated body fluid, the 45S5 adhesive precipitated hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate (SEM/EDX, ATR/FTIR, and XDR). The addition of 45S5 and NbG to the adhesives improved the stability of the resin-dentin interface after 1 year. Significance The incorporation of microparticles from 45S5 bioactive glass in self-etching adhesive systems is considered an excellent alternative for the development of a bioactive adhesive that improves the integrity of the hybrid layer on sound dentin.","Self-etching adhesive systems, Bioactivity, Ions release, Alkalizing activity, Microtensile bonding strength, Nanoleakage, Bioactive glass, Mechanical properties"

Methods Three-dimensional (3D) models (N=90) with different combinations of design parameters (thickness, cusp angle and occlusal notch geometry) and material type (lithium disilicate, feldspar ceramic, zirconia, hybrid resin ceramic and hybrid polymer-infiltrated ceramic) were developed for the failure analysis using extended finite element method (XFEM) to identify the stress distribution, crack initiation load, fracture surface area and fracture pattern. Analytical formulation, in vitro fracture tests and fractographic analysis of dedicated models were also performed to validate the findings of the XFEM simulation. Results For all material types considered, crowns with a sharp occlusal notch design had a significantly lower fracture resistance against occlusal loading. In most of the models, greater crown thickness and cusp angle resulted in a higher crack initiation load. However, the effect of cusp angle was dominant when the angle was in the low range of 50° for which increasing thickness did not enhance the crack initiation load. Significance Comparing the critical load of crack initiation for different models with the maximum biting force revealed that for the studied monolithic materials excluding zirconia, a design with a rounded occlusal notch, 70° cusp angle and medium thickness (1.5mm occlusal) is an optimum combination of design parameters in terms of tooth conservation and fracture resistance. Zirconia crowns exhibited sufficient strength for a more conservative design with less thickness (1.05mm occlusal) and sharper cusp angle (60°).","Monolithic dental crown, Extended finite element analysis, Thickness, Cusp angle, Material property"

Methods CHX-modified HNTs were synthesized using 10% or 20% CHX solutions. The primer and the adhesive components of SBMP were incorporated with 15wt.% of the CHX-encapsulated HNTs. Degree of conversion (DC) and viscosity analyses were performed to characterize the modified primers/adhesives. For bond strength testing, acid-etched dentin was treated with one of the following: SBMP (control); 0.2%CHX solution before SBMP; CHX-modified primers+SBMP adhesive; SBMP primer+CHX-modified adhesives; and SBMP primer+CHX-free HNT-modified adhesive. The microtensile bond strength test was performed after immediate (24h) and long-term (6 months) of water storage. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey (α=5%) and the Weibull analysis. Results DC was greater for the CHX-free HNT-modified adhesive, whereas the other experimental adhesives showed similar DC as compared with the control. Primers were less viscous than the adhesives, without significant differences within the respective materials. At 24h, all groups showed similar bonding performance and structural reliability; whereas at the 6-month period, groups treated with the 0.2%CHX solution prior bonding or with the CHX-modified primers resulted in greater bond strength than the control and superior reliability. Significance The modification of a primer or adhesive with CHX-encapsulated HNTs was an advantageous approach that did not impair the polymerization, viscosity and bonding performance of the materials, showing a promising long-term effect on resin-dentin bonds.","Nanotube, Halloysite, Aluminosilicate clay, Microtensile, Dentin, Adhesives, Bonding"

There are a number of problems with the design of this test and its mechanical analysis, and thus with the validity of the results obtained, were it to be used. Firstly, friction is ignored in calculating the horizontal wedging force. Secondly, the test specimen does not make use of a pre-crack at the notch tip. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of these factors on the FT calculated. Methods An analytical solution for the mode-I stress intensity factor (KI) of the compact tension specimen, which bears some similarities, is taken to be applicable. The mechanics of the specimen has been reanalysed, with a finite-element study of the resultant stresses, and compared with the compact-tension test. Results The assumed analytical solution can provide accurate estimates for KI for the V notched specimen. However, the apparent agreement is due to the fortuitous combination of an overestimated horizontal wedging force and an underestimated stress singularity at the crack tip. In any case, ignoring friction will lead to an overestimate of FT. Significance It is concluded that the test as presented is invalid.","Fracture mechanics, Circular disc, V-notch, Wedging, Compact tension"

These devices are subjected to different environments which include dental hard tissues, tissue fluids, blood and saliva. All dental devices are continuously challenged microbiologically and a number of failures in clinical management are related to microbial colonization. Thus, the assessment of the antimicrobial properties of dental devices are extremely important. In this paper, a classification of dental devices is being proposed. This classification distinguishes the devices based on whether they are implantable or not, and also sub-classified based on their specific application and the substrate receiving the device. Methods and Results A literature search was conducted to identify how dental devices have been tested with relation to the microbial strains used and whether the testing has been performed in isolation or reported with other relevant tests such as material characterization and biological activity. The results of the literature review were analyzed and recommendations for antimicrobial testing of dental devices are proposed. These recommendations include the need for the setting up of pre-testing parameters such as ageing and the details of the pre-testing sterilization procedures, as these may affect the material chemistry and the specification for antimicrobial testing to be done with specific single strains or polymicrobial that are native to the region where the device is located are also suggested. Testing can be undertaken in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Since the antimicrobial and biological activities influence/condition one another and the material chemistry may affect both the antimicrobial and biological testing this document also makes recommendations regarding biological assessment which can be carried out in isolation or integrated with the microbiological testing and also material testing methods including chemical and physical characterization of bulk, surface, eluted and degraded materials as well as physical characterization methods. Significance The level of standardization of antimicrobial testing for the dental devices needs to be based on the device location and host interaction in order to increase the clinical applicability of the mentioned tests.","Standardization, Antimicrobial testing, Dental devices"

For each group, two identically pre-treated zirconia blocks were applied G-Multi Primer, cemented together with G-Cem Linkforce cement and cut into 30 stick-shaped specimens (1×1×9mm3). A total of 120 specimens were stored in distilled water for 24h and then assigned to three groups: (i) short-term test, (ii) thermocycling for 5000, and (iii) thermocycling for 10,000 cycles.

Failure mode and surfaces were analyzed with optical microscopy and SEM. The EDS, FTIR, XRD, and FIB-SEM were used for chemical, crystalline phase analyses. Results The AA groups recorded higher mean bond strength than the CC groups in all aging conditions. Thermocycling did not affect the bond strength of the AA groups, whereas the bond strength of the CC groups decreased significantly after aging. The MDP monomer and silane in G-Multi Primer chemically reacted with mechanically pre-treated AA and CC surfaces via the absorption of P–O and Si–O groups.

PAC provided a statistically higher 24 h and 6-month aging bond strength. Intermediary similar µTBS were presented by control and CNMA (p = 0.108). All adhesives applied attained significantly reduced bond strength after aging (p < 0.05). Interfaces created using CNMA were almost devoid of silver deposits initially, however all groups showed large amounts of silver deposits on resin-dentin interface subjected to water aging. Significance Although CNMA was effective in inhibiting gelatinolytic enzymes, when incorporated into a universal adhesive it could not promote less degradation of the adhesive interface after water aging. Since it is a hydrophobic monomer, CNMA did not interact well with dentin collagen, however it reduced the solubility of the adhesive system besides not interfering in its polymerization.","Cardanol, Organic synthesis, Methacrylates, Dentin-bonding agents, Hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, Fibrillar collagens, Collagen crosslinkers, Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, Longevity"

Methods The dental, engineering and ceramic literature (PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar) covering the last 20years was over viewed regarding enamel and dentin characterization, structure-property studies, as well as, publications related to bioinspired materials with relationship to tooth structure. Relevant publications were selected for inclusion. Results Enamel has been studied and modelled at 3 hierarchical levels, prism structure, parallel prism interactions and enamel decussation effects. Missing is a 4th level where the previous three hierarchies are combined with the 3D arrangement of these levels in enamel areas. Aspects of the enamel prism infrastructure and prism decussation have been used in 3D printing of Bouligand ceramic structures. The dento-enamel junction serves to arrest cracks and reduce the stress in enamel as a graded elastic modulus layer, leading to development of dental ceramics with increased strength and fatigue resistance. Dentin is a compliant structure that supports enamel mechanically and may, through providing interstitial fluid at the DEJ, allow repair of microcracks in enamel. Adequate models of dentin properties remain to be developed as it remains highly variable in tubule lumen size and the degree of mineral density around and between tubules. Significance The structure of teeth, particularly the 4 hierarchical levels of enamel, creates a vital, hard, tough damage tolerant system for inspiring new materials.","Dentin, Enamel, Dentoenamel junction, Mineralized tissues, Graded structure, Enamel prisms, Decussation, Bioinspired design"

Methods Samples of yttria-stabilized zirconia were prepared by stratifying four layers (L1, L2, L3 and L4) of ML-type KATANA multi-layered monolithic discs, whose surfaces were then sandblasted with alumina particles (110 µm and 0.2 MPa) in order to evaluate its effect on the presence of different crystalline phases as well as on the optical and mechanical properties of each of the four layers. The optical characterization was carried out by measuring the reflectance spectrum and colorimetric parameters by UV-Vis spectrophotometric analysis and the transmittance curves were indirectly obtained using the Kubelka-Munk model (KM). Microstructural, structural, mechanical and roughness characterizations were also performed using SEM, XRD, biaxial flexural strength B3B, and light interferometry, respectively Results According to the KM model there are different degrees of translucency between the upper and lower layers of the monolithic discs, but there was no influence of the Al2O3-sandblasting treatment on this optical property. The disk pigmentation causes greater absorption of light below 600 nm, decreasing the transmittance rate to values below 25% in this region of the spectrum. The yellowing index presented higher values for inner disk layers L3 and L4, in agreement with the highest values of the light absorption coefficient K observed for these layers. The roughness of the samples did not change significantly with the surface treatment performed and the sandblasting did not result in new crystalline phases. SEM analysis showed the presence of different grain sizes in all layers analyzed, being related to the co-occurring presence of cubic (c-ZrO2) and tetragonal (t-ZrO2) phases in similar contents (∼ 50 wt%). The Weibull statistical analysis, in turn, showed an increase in the Weibull characteristic stress value (σ0) for most layers subjected to sandblasting, except for the second layer (central region of the disk). It was also verified an increase in the value of the structural reliability of the material (m), referring to the samples of the central region of the disc (L2 and L3 layers) after sandblasting. Significance: The pigmentation in the disk causes a decrease of the transmittance rate to values well below 25% in the region of the spectrum 400–600 nm and the inner layers (L3 and L4) have even lower transmittance than the outer layers in this spectrum range. Although the CR index indicates variation related to the Al2O3-sandblasting treatment, the transmittance spectra of KM model show that the sandblasting did not cause a significant change in the transmittance rate of the four analyzed layers. Also, there is no significant difference in the light scattering of the different layers of the disc, either before or after Al2O3-sandblasting treatment.","Multi-layered zirconia, Translucency parameter, Kubelka-Munk model, Transmittance, Roughness, Mechanical properties"

Materials and method Sixty Class-V cavities were restored according to the adhesive protocol (n=12): 1) control group, Scotchbond Multi-Purpose, 3M (CTRL), 2) 2% CHX dentine pre-treatment (DENT), 3) 0.1% CHX in primer (PRIM), 4) 0.1% CHX in bonding agent (BOND), 5) Peak Universal Bond including 0.2% CHX (PEAK). Specimens were thermocycled (10,000 cycles) and inserted into a Streptococcus mutans biofilm artificial mouth (caries model). The 10-day biological loading protocol consisted of consecutive phases of demineralisation (1h) and remineralisation (5h). Evaluation under a fluorescence microscope (demineralisation) and an SEM (marginal gap) followed, at restoration margins, and at 0.3mm and 0.5mm distance from the margins, in enamel and in dentine. Total demineralization was calculated as the sum of demineralisation and substance loss due to demineralisation. Results PRIM (p=0.007, mod. LSD), BOND (p=0.012, mod. LSD) and PEAK (p=0.008, mod. LSD) exhibited significantly higher total demineralisation values in enamel margins than CTRL. No significant differences were noted for total demineralisation in dentine. Regarding marginal gaps, DENT exhibited significantly lower enamel gap values compared to all other groups (p=0.001). Conclusions 2% CHX as dentine pre-treatment, 0.1% or 0.2% CHX added in adhesives did not provide any antibacterial effect regarding secondary caries in dentine. On the other hand, 2% CHX dentine pre-treatment managed to limit marginal gap formation in enamel compared to the other adhesive protocols in the study.","Class V, Resin composite, Secondary caries, Antibacterial, Dentin adhesives, Enamel bonding"

However, the specific application of BAGs produced through sol-gel synthesis in restorative dentistry has not been reviewed previously. This review provides a comprehensive account of the principles behind sol-gel derived BAGs and their investigation for dental tissue restoration materials. Methods A search for in vitro and in vivo studies was performed using the databases Web of Science®, Medline®, Scopus® and Google Scholar®. Articles published over the past 20 years were selected and data on the BAG composition and morphology was extracted. Analysis of the effect of specific BAG additives on the properties of experimental dental materials was also performed. Results A majority of BAG particles investigated were spheres ranging in size from 5 nm to ~650 µm. Sol-gel BAGs are mainly applied in the treatment of hypersensitive dentine and for pulp-dentine tissue engineering, while a handful have been used in target drug delivery. BAG fillers are promising additives that result in improved biological properties, antibacterial effects, hardness, acid buffering and remineralization. Unfortunately, some detrimental effects on optical properties have been observed with BAG addition. Additionally, in vivo data, investigations into radiopacity and standardization of test protocols are identified as areas for improvement and further studies.

Methods This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020175715) and it followed the PRISMA Statement. The literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, SciELO, Scopus, LILACS, IBECS, and BBO from the starting coverage date through 30 June 2021. Study eligibility criteria consisted of in vitro studies that evaluated the bond strength (microtensile, microshear, tensile or shear testing) to sound dentin/enamel of a minimum of two distinct SE systems, with at least one material containing 10-MDP and one other being comprised of a distinct acidic composition. Statistical analyses were carried out with RevMan 5.3.5 and using random-effects models with the significance level at p < 0.05. Also, Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using MetaInsight V3 tool. Results From 740 relevant studies evaluated in full-text analysis, 210 were incorporated to the systematic review and 206 in meta-analysis. The majority of studies was classified as having medium risk of bias (56.7%), followed by low (35.2%) and high (8.1%) risk of bias. Data from a total of 64 adhesive systems were collected, which favored the 10-MDP-based group at both dentin (overall effect: 6.98; 95% CI: 5.61, 8.36; p < 0.00001) and enamel (overall effect: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.62, 3.96; p < 0.00001) substrates. Microtensile testing was more frequently used (73.4%) in the included studies. Adhesives based on 10-MDP showed greater bonding performance than adhesives comprised of monomers such as PENTA, 6-MHP, 4-META, 4-MET, pyrophosphate esters, mixed composition or monomers derived from sulfonic acid (p ≤ 0.01); whereas similar bond strength values were verified between 10-MDP-based materials and those containing PEM-F, acrylamide phosphates, 4-AET, MAC-10, or monomers derived from polyacrylic and phosphonic acids (p ≥ 0.05). Adhesives based on GPDM were the only ones that resulted in greater bonding potential than the 10-MDP-based group (p = 0.03). Dental bonds in dentin were favored with the application of 2-step 10-MDP-based adhesives; whereas in enamel the dental bonds were favored for both 2-steps versions of adhesives, regardless of the presence of 10-MDP. Indirect evidence from NMA revealed that 1-step 10-MDP-free and universal 10-MDP-free adhesives seemed to perform worst in dentin and enamel, respectively. Significance Adhesives containing 10-MDP showed higher bonding performance than materials formulated with other acidic ingredients, although this result relied on the type of mechanical testing, type of the substrate, acidic composition of the adhesive, and the application category of the SE system. This review summarized the effects of the foregoing factors on the adhesion to dental substrates.","Dental bonding, Functional acidic monomer, Universal adhesives, Dentin, Enamel"

This study aims to probe the structural and physicochemical attributes responsible for higher toxicity of dental monomers, using quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling approaches. Methods A regression-based linear single-target QSAR (st-QSAR) model was developed with a comparatively small dataset containing 39 compounds, the cytotoxicity of which has been assessed over the Hela S3 cell line. By contrast, a classification-based multi-target QSAR model was developed with 138 compounds, the cytotoxicity of which has been reported against 18 different cell lines. Both models were set up following rigorous validation protocols confirming their statistical significance and robustness. Results The performance of the linear mt-QSAR model, developed with various feature selection and post-selection similarity searching-based schemes, superseded that of all non-linear models produced with six machine learning methods by hyperparameter optimization. The final derived st-QSAR and mt-QSAR linear models are shown to be highly predictive, as well as revealing the crucial structural and physicochemical factors responsible for higher cytotoxicity of the dental monomers. Significance This study is the first attempt on unveiling the cytotoxicity of dental monomers over several cell lines by means of a single multi-target QSAR model. Further, such a model is ready to get widespread applicability in the screening of new monomers, judging from its almost accurate predictions over diverse experimental assay conditions.","Dental monomers, Cytotoxicity, Multi-target QSAR models, Machine learning, Similarity searching"

In the present investigation, the formation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 in LPS- or LTA-stimulated cells from the dental pulp interface and pulp fibroblasts was analyzed in the presence of the resin monomer 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) under varying cellular redox conditions. Method Human pulp fibroblasts (HPC) or cells from the dental pulp interface expressing an odontoblast phenotype (hOD-1) were exposed to LTA, LPS or HEMA for 1 h or 24 h. Redox homeostasis was modified by the prooxidant BSO (L-buthionine sulfoximine) or the antioxidant NAC (N-acetyl cysteine). Formation of TNFα or IL-6 was analyzed by ELISA, and cell survival was determined by a crystal violet assay. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney-U-test. Results Secretion of TNFα was not detected in LPS- or LTA-stimulated HPC or hOD-1, and IL-6 was not found after a short exposure (1 h). After a 24 h exposure, LPS induced a 3-fold increase in IL-6 formation in HPC, while LTA stimulated IL-6 release about 20-fold. Likewise, LTA was more effective than LPS in hOD-1 stimulating IL-6 levels about 50-fold. HEMA inhibited the LPS- and LTA-induced IL-6 release, and this effect was enhanced by BSO but counteracted by NAC in both cell types. IL-6 release was independent of cell survival rates. Conclusions The protective immune response in odontoblasts and pulp fibroblasts is impaired by monomers such as HEMA through the disturbance of the redox homeostasis.","LPS, LTA, Resin monomer, HEMA, Pulp cells, Odontoblasts, Oxidative stress, Cytokine"

Methods Human dentin was microtomed into 6-μm-thick films, which were demineralized and treated for 60 s using solutions containing 0.6% and 2% of one of the crosslinkers: tannic acid (TAC), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), and N-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), and for 1 h using EDC/NHS. Half of the treated and untreated (control) films were subjected to human saliva incubation. Collagen biostability was assessed via exogenous protease biodegradation by weight loss and hydroxyproline release, and endogenous MMPs by in situ zymography. The degradation products of galloylated polyphenols (TAC and EGCG) by saliva were monitored using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The esterase activity of saliva induced by the crosslinkers was also assessed. Results Collagen films treated with TAC and EGCG exhibited significantly improved biostability (p < 0.05); however, the enhanced biostability was severely reduced after saliva incubation (p < 0.001). For EDC/NHS treated collagen, saliva incubation showed negligible effect on the biostability. 1H NMR studies confirmed the esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the galloyl. GPC measurements showed decreased molecular weight of TAC in saliva indicating its chemical degradation. Both TAC and EGCG showed much higher esterase activity than other treatment groups. Significance The galloyl group plays important role in collagen crosslinking, inducing higher biostability. However, galloylated polyphenols crosslinked on collagen are highly susceptible to metabolism of human saliva by salivary esterase, dramatically compromising the enhanced biostability.","Esterases, Hydrolysis, De-galloylation, Human saliva, Crosslinking, Collagen biostability, Polyphenols"

A variety of commercial dental nanomaterials are available and researched. Nevertheless, how these nanomaterials work, what makes them special and whether they are superior to traditional dental materials is not always clear to dentists and researchers. The objective of this review paper is, therefore, to give an overview of the principles of nanomaterials and basic research and applications of dental nanomaterials. Methods The fundamentals of materials science of nanomaterials as well as their advantages and disadvantages are elaborated. The most important dental nanomaterials are discussed. This is mainly based on a survey of the literature and a review of the most frequently cited scientific papers in the international peer reviewed journal Dental Materials over the past five years. The developments of commercial dental nanomaterials as well as aspects of their clinical use are considered in this review.

Methods Experimental calcium phosphates were formulated using β-tricalcium phosphate, monocalcium phosphate monohydrate, calcium hydroxide, and different concentrations of calcium/sodium fluoride salts [(5 wt%: VSG5F), (10 wt%: VSG10F), (20 wt%: VSG20F)]. A fluoride-free calcium phosphate (VSG) was used as control. Each tested material was immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF), (24 h, 15 and 30 days) to assess their ability to crystallise into apatite-like. Cumulative fluoride release was assayed up to 45 days. Moreover, each powder was placed into a medium containing human dental pulp stem cells (200 mg/mL) and their cytotoxicity was analysed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)− 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (24 h, 48 h and 72 h incubation). These latter results were statistically analysed by ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α = 0.05). Results All the experimental VSG-F materials produced fluoride-containing apatite-like crystals after SBF immersion. VSG20F presented prolonged release of fluoride ions into the storage media (45d). VSG, VSG10F and VSG20F showed a significant cytotoxicity at dilution of 1:1, while at 1:5, only VSG and VSG20F demonstrated a reduction in cell viability. At lower dilutions (1:10, 1:50 and 1:100) all specimens showed no significant toxicity to hDPSCs, but an increase in cell proliferation. Significance The experimental fluoride-doped calcium-phosphates are biocompatible and possess a clear ability to evoke fluoride-containing apatite-like crystallisation. Hence, they may be promising remineralising materials for dental applications.","Crystallisation, Apatite, Fluoride, Fluor-hydroxyapatite, Biocompatibility"

Two hypotheses were tested: (1) there is a statistically significant decreasing relationship between the bonding strength and the transverse distances to the center of the luting material, and (2) there is a statistically significant difference between bonding strengths among luting spaces with different configuration factors. Methods 10 PMMA (15 mm Ø) pairs of cylinders were cemented (Scotchbond Universal adhesive & Relyx Universal, both chemically cured) in a compliant setup under two (20 and 70 N) luting forces forming 2 groups (5 samples each), resulting in different C-factors. Whole samples were sectioned in x and y directions obtaining non-trimmed beams from all along the luting surfaces. Their relative positions in each sample were assessed before separating and categorized (10 categories) according to their distances to the center of the sample. All beams were tested in tension and, because of their uneven bonding areas and to balance its influence, UTS results were transformed into UTSres. First hypothesis was tested trough a linear relationship between UTSres and distances to vertical centers per samples. Second hypothesis was tested using Mann-Whitney U tests to compare UTSres between groups, along all categories. Further Weibull analysis was applied. Results ANOVA’s p of the regression UTSres – categories were statistically significant for all samples in group 70 N and for all except one in group 20 N: first hypothesis is partially maintained. Although Mann-Whitney tests p comparing UTSres of both groups for all categories but the first were statistically significant this hypothesis was maintained relying in Weibull analysis. Significance: bonded attachment of cemented materials decreases from centers to outbounds in plane, extensive surfaces, and this decrease is C-factor related.","Luting resin composites, Tensile test, Configuration factor, Polymerization strain"

Objective of our investigation was to determine the impact of HEMA on oral keratinocytes (OKF6/TERT2) and gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) in a newly established 3D co-culture model (3D-CCM) and to analyze the permeability of OKF6/TERT2 cells for HEMA. Methods Well-characterized 3D-CCMs, consisting of confluent OKF6/TERT2 cells on cell culture inserts above HGF-containing collagen gels, were treated supra-epithelial with HEMA. Mass spectrometry was used to measure the supra- and sub-epithelial distribution of HEMA after 24 h. The impact of HEMA on nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) target genes was measured by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Results Mass spectrometry showed that HEMA was evenly distributed above and below the keratinocyte layer after 24 h. Analyzed target genes of Nrf2 were induced in both cell types on the mRNA-level but less pronounced in HGFs. On the protein-level, both cell types showed similar effects: At 5 mM HEMA, heme oxygenase-1 was induced 5.1-fold in OKF6/TERT2 cells and 4.1-fold in HGFs. NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase-1 was approximately induced 1.85-fold in both cell types. Significance Our 3D-CCM is suitable to analyze the biocompatibility of dental materials due to an improved simulation of the oral mucosa compared to monolayer cultures. Our results indicate that HEMA is able to penetrate a dense layer of keratinocytes and to activate the cellular oxidative defense response. This may be due to the activation of the Nrf2-pathway in both cell types.","HEMA, Oral keratinocytes, Gingival fibroblasts, 3D co-culture, Redox-regulated gene expression"

Methods Undoped-NPs, Dex-doped NPs (Dex-NPs) and zinc-doped-Dex-NPs (Zn-Dex-NPs) were tested at dentin, after 24 h and 21 d. A control group without NPs was included. Coronal dentin surfaces were studied by nano-dynamic mechanical analysis measurements, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Mean and standard deviation were analyzed by ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons (p < 0.05). Results At 21 d of storage time, both groups doped with Dex exhibited the highest complex, storage and loss moduli among groups. Zn-Dex-NPs and Dex-NPs promoted the highest and lowest tan delta values, respectively. Dex-NPs contributed to increase the fibril diameters of dentin collagen over time. Dentin surfaces treated with Zn-Dex-NPs attained the lowest nano-roughness values, provoked the highest crystallinity, and produced the longest and shortest crystallite and grain size. These new crystals organized with randomly oriented lattices. Dex-NPs induced the highest microstrain. Crystalline and amorphous matter was present in the mineral precipitates of all groups, but Zn and Dex loaded NPs helped to increase crystallinity. Significance Dentin treated with Zn-Dex-NPs improved crystallographic and atomic order, providing structural stability, high mechanical performance and tissue maturation. Amorphous content was also present, so high hydroxyapatite solubility, bioactivity and remineralizing activity due to the high ion-rich environment took place in the infiltrated dentin.","Apatite, Dentin, Dexamethasone, Polymeric nanoparticles, Remineralization, Transmission electron microscopy, Viscoelastic, X-ray diffraction, Zinc"

Methods Upon priming dentin with the 10-MDP-based Clearfil SE Bond 2’ primer (‘C-SE2p’; Kuraray Noritake), three experimental adhesive resins, consisting of 50 wt.% Bis-GMA, 15 wt.% TEGDMA, and either 35 wt.% diethyl acrylamide (‘DEAA’), hydroxyethyl acrylamide (‘HEAA’) or HEMA (‘HEMA+’), were applied. The control HEMA-free adhesive resin contained 60 wt.% Bis-GMA and 40 wt.% TEGDMA (‘HEMA−’). All adhesives were evaluated for ‘immediate’ and ‘aged’ micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) to dentin upon, respectively, 1-week (1w) and 6-month (6m) water storage, TEM adhesive-dentin interfacial interaction, 24-h and 6m three-point bending, contact-angle wetting, viscosity and watersorption. Results Linear mixed-effects model statistics revealed significantly better bonding performance of the adhesives applied in E&R than SE mode, except for DEAA_1w, with the highest μTBSs recorded for DEAA and HEMA− applied in SE mode. In E&R mode, aging did not significantly reduce DEAA’s μTBS. Best wetting on primed dentin was recorded for HEMA+, significantly better than DEAA, further HEAA and HEMA−, these directly related to their viscosity. HEAA absorbed significantly more water than all other adhesive-resin formulations. HEMA−>DEAA>HEAA>HEMA+ was the significant order for 6m bending strength. Conclusions The acrylamide co-monomer DEAA could replace HEMA, while HEAA not.","HEMA, Durability, Acrylamides, Linear mixed-effects model (LME), TEM, Bond strength"

Methods Two polyphenols [proanthocyanidin (PA) and quercetin (QC)] with different water solubility were prepared as treatment solutions using ethanol (EtOH) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents. 6-um-thick dentin films were microtomed from dentin slabs of third molars. Following demineralization, films or slabs were subject to 60-s treatment (PA or QC) or no treatment (control) with subsequent extended-rinse with original solvent (EtOH or DMSO) or distilled water (DW). Collagen crosslinking interactions were assessed by FTIR. Biostability was assessed through endogenous MMPs activity via confocal laser scanning microscopy, and exogenous collagenase degradation via weight loss, hydroxyproline release and SEM. Finally, direct collagenase inactivation was also evaluated. Data were analyzed by three-way ANOVA and post-hoc tests (α=0.05%). Results Distinct effects of two polyphenols and solvents on collagen crosslinking and biostabilization were observed. Higher crosslinking and biostability efficacy occurred with PA than QC (p<0.001) that demonstrated negligible collagen interactions. With DMSO solvent, efficacy results were significantly reduced with both polyphenols (p<0.05). DMSO-rinse further weakened interactions of PA with collagen, diminishing biostability (p<0.05). Low biostability was detected with QC and DW-rinse, suggesting direct enzymatic inhibition due to physical presence in collagen. Significance Collagen crosslinking interactions and biostability depend on polyphenol chemical characteristics. Treatment-solution solvents may affect interactions between polyphenols and collagen, specifically, DMSO showed detrimental effects on collagen crosslinking and biostability and should be used with caution.","Collagen crosslinking, Dentin, Polyphenols, Proanthocyanidin, Quercetin, Dimethyl sulfoxide"

Methods The occlusal dentin surfaces of six teeth were ground flat. Glass-ionomer cement was bonded to the surfaces either with or without polyalkenoic acid conditioning. The teeth were sectioned into 1-mm2 stick-shaped specimens. The specimens obtained were randomly assigned to two groups with different periods of storage in water: 1 week and 1 year. The micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) was determined for each storage time. Additional specimens were prepared for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM); they were produced with or without prior polyalkenoic acid conditioning in the same way as in the μTBS test. Results There was no significant difference in μTBS to conditioned dentin and non-conditioned dentin (p > 0.05). The failures appeared to be of a mixed nature, although aging caused more areas of cohesive than adhesive failure in both groups. The TEM observation showed an intermediate layer, a matrix-rich layer and a partially demineralized layer in the polyalkenoic acid conditioned group.

The analysis includes the cytotoxicity of the powders and their effect on odontogenic gene expression. Methods Sound human dentine specimens were air-abraded using bioglass 45S5 (BAG), polycarboxylated zinc-doped bioglass (SEL), alumina (AL) and submitted to SEM analysis. Resin composite was bonded to air-abraded or smear layer-covered dentine (SML) using an experimental (EXP) or a commercial adhesive (ABU) in etch&rinse (ER) or self-etch (SE) modes. Specimens were stored in artificial saliva (AS) and subjected to MTBS testing after 24 h and 10 months. Interfacial nanoleakage assessment was accomplished using confocal microscopy. The cytotoxicity of the powders was assessed, also the total RNA was extracted and the expression of odontogenic genes was evaluated through RT-PCR. Results After prolonged AS storage, specimens in the control (SML) and AL groups showed a significant drop in MTBS (p > 0.05), with degradation evident within the bonding interface. Specimens in BAG or SEL air-abraded dentine groups showed no significant difference, with resin-dentine interfaces devoid of important degradation. The metabolic activity of pulp stem cells was not affected by the tested powders. SEL and BAG had no effect on the expression of odontoblast differentiation markers. However, AL particles interfered with the expression of the odontogenic markers. Significance The use of bioactive glass air-abrasion may prevent severe degradation at the resin-dentine interface.

Methods Fluorapatite (FA) arrays were fabricated on zirconia discs by hydrothermal treatment. After polymer infiltration, an enamel-like structure was obtained on zirconia-based PICN materials. Effects of hydrothermal treatment conditions on the FA arrays were investigated by XRD, FTIR and SEM. Human gingival fibroblast cells (HGFs) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were used to evaluate the cytocompatibility and antibacterial properties. Nanoindentation method was employed to determine elastic modulus and hardness. Results A facile and pervasive method was developed in this study to fabricate an enamel-like structure constituted of controlled FA arrays and interstitial resin on zirconia-based PICN materials. The obtained FA arrays can significantly promote the adhesion and proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), and further effectively inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli.

Methods A total of 101 posterior tooth elements were included in a prospective clinical study, which included ex vivo LTD monitoring (at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years) using Raman spectroscopy (n = 2640 monoclinic phase measurement points per evaluation time) and SEM. Four types of areas (1–2 mm2 surface, 6 on molars, and 4 on premolars) were analyzed on each element surface: occlusal, axial, glazed, or unglazed. Raman depth mapping and high-resolution SEM were performed on the selected samples. Results LTD developed in 3Y-TZP monolithic restorations 6 months after intraoral placement and progressed with time. After two years, the tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation was non-uniform, with the presence of localized clusters of transformed grains. In axial areas, the grain aspect was typical of the classical nucleation-growth process reported for LTD, which progresses from the surface to a depth of several tens of microns. However, in occlusal areas, tribological stress generated surface crushing and grain pull-out from the clusters, which induced an underestimation of the aging process when the evaluation was limited to monoclinic phase quantification. Glazing cannot be considered a protection against LTD.

The elimination of labile ester bonds is a potential advantage of methacrylamides, which have been shown to produce more stable restorative interfaces. The rationale of this study is to design hydrolytically and enzymatically stable adhesive monomers, with the added benefit of being able to form crosslinked networks. The objective of this study was to synthesize difunctional, hybrid methacrylate-methacrylamide monomers, and evaluate them as potential monomers for dental adhesives. Materials and methods HEMA, TEGDMA (controls) or secondary methacrylamides (HEMAM – commercially available, 2EM and 2dMM – newly synthesized) either bearing a hydroxyl group or a methacrylate functionality (Hybrids-Hy), were added at 40mass% to bisGMA. The photoinitiator system consisted of 2-dimethoxyphenyl acetophenone (DMPA) and diphenyl iodonium hexafluorophosphate (DPI-PF6) at 0.2 and 0.4mass%, respectively. Polymerization kinetics were followed in real-time by near-IR spectroscopy during light activation at 630mW/cm2 for 300s. Water sorption and solubility (WS, SL) were measured according to ISO 4049. Storage modulus in shear (G′) for 300s was obtained by oscillatory rheometry. For the microtensile bond strength (μTBS), fully formulated adhesives containing 40vol% ethanol were used to restore caries-free human third molars. Bonded specimens with 1mm2 cross-sectional area were tested after 48h and 6 months storage in water at 37°C. Single bond (SB) was tested as a commercial control. Data were analysed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test and Student's t-test (α=0.05). Results In general, hybrid versions showed lower polymerization rate and degree of conversion, whereas the methacrylate controls, HEMA and TEGDMA, showed the highest values. The hybrid versions showed lower values of WS and SL than their monofunctional versions. HEMAM Hy showed the highest values of G′ and TEGDMA, 2EM, and 2dMM-Hy the lowest. The μTBS values between 48h and 6 months were statistically reduced only for the HEMA and both 2dMM materials. The formulation containing the monofunctional methacrylamide (HEMAM) showed only 9% reduction in μTBS after 6 months of aging, while the other groups showed a decrease ranging between 18% and 33%. Conclusion Overall, hybrid monomers showed lower reactivity than their analogous monofunctional versions, but had markedly lower water sorption. Shear storage modulus was affected differently by the addition of the second functionality. HEMAM-containing systems were able to maintain stable long-term dentin bond strength, which demonstrates that bonding stability is a result of the complex interplay among the factors studied. Clinical significance The novel monomers showed here are potential alternatives to the current methacrylate adhesives, with selected formulations presenting greater bond stability.","Dental materials, Hybrids, Methacrylate, Methacrylamide, Restorative dentistry, Adhesives"

Dentin matrices (n=15) were prepared from human molars to determine the apparent modulus of elasticity over 18months of aging. Susceptibility of the dentin matrix to degradation by endogenous and exogenous proteases was determined by presence of solubilized collagen in supernatant, and resistance to degradation by bacterial collagenase, respectively.

The base intact model includes the mandible (spongy and compact bone), 14 teeth (comprising dentin, enamel, periodontal ligament, and pulp), simplified temporomandibular joints, and masticatory muscles (masseter, temporalis, medial, and lateral pterygoid). Results The complete source code, executables, showcases, and sample data are freely available on the public repository: https://github.com/ArsoVukicevic/OpenMandible. It has been demonstrated that by slightly editing the baseline model, one can study different “virtual” treatments or diseases, including tooth restoration, placement of implants, mandible bone degradation, and others. Significance OpenMandible eases the community to undertake a broad range of studies on the topic, while increasing their consistency and reproducibility. At the same time, the needs for dedicated equipment and skills for developing realistic simulation models are significantly reduced.","OpenMandible, Mandible, Simulation, Dentistry, Open source"

Methods The extinction coefficient was measured within a spectral range of 300–980 nm using a collimated transmission setup. 35 specimens from 16 donors were examined. The donors were categorized by age and the researched specimen were categorized by tooth type, tooth quality and lateral expansion of the enamel to clarify the influence of these parameters. Results The obtained spectrally resolved extinction coefficient was accurately described by a power law, which agrees with theoretical scattering models. The results were evaluated with regard to the influence of parameters such as subject age, tooth type, enamel sample quality and enamel width. For this purpose, both the average values of multiple measurements of a single sample in a defined spectral range as well as the curve slope of the averaged results versus wavelength were compared. Significance The results provide detailed information about the optical properties of human enamel. The wide spectrum investigated provides important information for the evaluation of the main scatterers and the optical impression under any light condition. However, the deviation of the extinction coefficient varies less between the mean values for the specimens grouped by several parameters than between the specimens themselves within a group. This indicates a unique optical behaviour for every specimen and this requires consideration in the development of artificial materials.","Extinction coefficient, Optical properties, Collimated transmission spectroscopy, Enamel, Optical appearance"

Here, we assessed the biological performance of S-PRG/Li-100 mM and compared it with that of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and S-PRG without additives. Methods In vivo studies were conducted on male Wistar rats using Masson’s trichrome staining in pulp-capped molars. The test materials were implanted subcutaneously to evaluate their capacity for vascularization and biocompatibility. The ability of the test materials to form apatite was tested by immersing them in simulated body fluid. Rhodamine-B staining was conducted to assess their sealing ability in bovine teeth, while their antibacterial activity was evaluated against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei in terms of colony-forming units and by live/dead staining. Results Masson’s trichrome staining and tissue-implantation tests confirmed the biocompatibility of S-PRG/Li-100 mM and it was similar to that of MTA and S-PRG; inflammation regression was observed 14 days after operation in the subcutaneous tissues. S-PRG/Li-100 mM promoted the formation of apatite on its surface. Both the S-PRG groups showed higher sealing capability and bactericidal/bacteriostatic activity against oral bacterial biofilms than MTA.

Methods Ten EV cylindrical dentin cavities were prepared and filled with MPC and stored for 1 month in distilled water (DW), Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), simulated body fluid (SBF), versus no media (NM) serving as control. Six additional EV specimens were filled with MPC and exposed for 2 weeks to leucocyte-and-platelet-rich fibrin (LPRF)-clot (C), LPRF-membrane (M) and LPRF-exudate (E). MPC in the EV specimens and in the coronal part of the REP tooth was analyzed by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy (MR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).

Methods Nanoparticles were characterized for their morphology and chemical structure using electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. Experimental dentin adhesive was modified using two weight percentage (0.25% and 0.5%) of RGO/nAg and GNP/nAg to study its degree of conversion (DC), antimicrobial potential, and cytotoxicity. The effect and significance of these modified bonding agents on resin-dentin bonded interface were investigated by evaluating interfacial nanoleakage, micropermeability, nanodynamic mechanical analysis, micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS), and four-point bending strength (BS), Results Both 0.25% and 0.5% GNP/nAg graphene-modified adhesives showed comparable DC values to the commercial and experimental adhesive (range: 42–46%). The bacterial viability of the groups 0.25% and 0.5% GNP-Ag remained very low under 25% compared to RGO/nAg groups with low cytotoxicity profiles (cell viability>85%). Resin-bonded dentin interface created with GNP/nAg showed homogenous, well-defined hybrid layer and regularly formed long resin tags devoid of any microporosity as evidenced by SEM and confocal microscopy. The lowest nanoleakage and highest bending strength and µTBS was recorded for 0.25% GNP/nAg after 12 months of ageing. A significantly increased nanoelasticity was seen for all experimental groups except for control groups. Significance The addition of 0.25% GNP/nAg showed optimized anti-biofilm properties without affecting the standard adhesion characteristics.","Graphene, Nanocomposites, Silver, Dentin, Adhesion, Interface"

Methods Two three-step ER adhesives, a two-step ER adhesive, and a universal adhesive in ER mode were evaluated. Before application of either primer or adhesive, phosphoric acid etching of human dentin was completed. Fifteen bonded specimens for each adhesive system were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 h, then subjected to a shear bond strength (SBS) test. Bonding durability was assessed from the perspective of biomechanical stress. 25 bonded specimens for each adhesive system were subjected to shear fatigue strength (SFS) testing with a repeated subcritical load at a frequency of 20 Hz for 50,000 cycles or until failure. Results Mean SBS and SFS values ranged from 33.3 to 41.2 MPa, and from 18.3 to 20.3 MPa, respectively. Three-step adhesives showed higher SBS and SFS values than the other adhesive systems. Under SEM, resin tags in different adhesive systems showed similar features, but morphology below the hybrid layer was material dependent. The universal adhesive in ER mode showed an obvious thin, high-density reaction layer below the hybrid layer. Significance Three-step adhesives showed higher dentin bond durability than the other ER adhesives; no significant differences in SFS were found between the universal adhesive in ER mode and the three-step ER adhesives. The results of this in vitro study indicate that some ER adhesives might establish chemical bonding with intact dentin below the hybrid layer in addition to micromechanical retention.","Dentin bond durability, Etch-&-rise systems, Biomechanical stress, Reaction layer"

Moreover, paste dental fillings were prepared, the compositions were irradiated with the dental lamp, and the degrees of cross-linking were measured by Raman spectroscopy. The polymerization shrinkage was also determined using the rheometer. In addition, their hardness was examined on the Shore scale. Finally, the color analysis of the composites in the L*a*b* color space was compared with the VITA CLASSIC colorant.

Methods Specimens produced from a high-viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC), a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC), and a resin-based composite (RBC) were randomly allotted to incubation in artificial saliva either for one week (AS-1), for five weeks (AS-5), for five weeks including twice/day brushing with 1450ppm NaF toothpaste (AS-5-brush), or one-time exposition to 5000ppm NaF after five weeks of incubation (AS-5-exp). Human enamel was used as reference. Surface roughness and the release of fluoride from the specimens was determined; biofilm formation was simulated using mono- or multispecies microbiological models and analysed employing an MTT-based approach and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Results Monospecies biofilm formation was significantly reduced on HVGIC in comparison to RMGIC and RBC. It was also reduced on HVGIC and enamel after treatment with fluoride in groups AS-5-brush and AS-5-exp in comparison to AS-5. These effects were particularly pronounced after 24h, and less pronounced after 48h of biofilm formation. In the multispecies microbiological model, similar observations were identified for HVGIC, while for enamel a significant reduction in biofilm formation was observed in groups AS-5-brush and AS-5-exp. No significant effect of fluoride treatments was identified for RMGIC and RBC, regardless of the microbiological model applied. Significance These data indicate that biofilm formation on the surfaces of a glass ionomer cement and enamel can be relevantly influenced by treatment with fluoride.

Methods Three MAPAs were synthesized via varying methacrylate (MA) to proanthocyanidins (PA) feeding ratios of 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 to obtain MAPA-1, MAPA-2, and MAPA-3, respectively. The three MAPAs were structurally characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic methods. 5-μm-thick dentin films were microtomed from dentin slabs of third molars. Following demineralization, films or slabs were treated with 1% MAPAs or PA in ethanol for 30 s. Collagen bio-stabilization against enzymatic degradation was analyzed by weight loss (WL) and hydroxyproline release (HYP) of films, as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on dentin slabs. Crosslinking capacity and interactions of MAPAs with collagen were investigated by FTIR. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α = 0.05%). Results MA:PA feeding ratios affected MAPAs’ chemical structures which in turn led to different collagen stabilization efficacy against degradation and varied collagen crosslinking capabilities. Higher collagen stabilization efficacy was detected using MAPA-1 (WL 10.52%; HYP 13.53 μg/mg) and MAPA-2 (WL 5.99%; HYP 11.02 μg/mg), which was comparable to that using PA (WL 8.79%; HYP 13.17 μg/mg) (p > 0.05), while a lower collagen stability occurred in MAPA-3 (WL 38.48%; HYP 29.49 μg/mg), indicating excessive MA-functionalization would compromise its stabilization efficacy. In comparison, complete digestion was detected for untreated collagen (WL 100%; HYP 102.76 μg/mg). The above results were consistent with collagen crosslinking efficacy of the three MAPAs revealed by SEM and FTIR. Significance A new class of novel polymerizable collagen cross-linkers MAPAs was synthesized and shown that, when appropriate MA:PA ratios were applied, the resulting MAPAs could render high collagen stability and the ability to copolymerize with resin monomers, overcoming the drawbacks of PA. These new polymerizable crosslinkers, when included in adhesives, could lead to long-lasting dentin bonding.","Proanthocyanidins, Methacrylate functionalization, Collagen cross-linking, Dentin collagen, Hydroxyproline"

Methods High-amplitude short-duration stress waves generated by laser pulse absorption are used to spall bacteria and cells from titanium substrates. By carefully controlling laser fluence and calibration of laser fluence with applied stress, the adhesion difference between Streptococcus mutans biofilms and MG 63 osteoblast-like cell monolayers on smooth and rough titanium substrates is obtained. The ratio of cell adhesion strength to biofilm adhesion strength (i.e., Adhesion Index) is determined as a nondimensionalized parameter for biocompatibility assessment. Results Adhesion strength of 143 MPa, with a 95% C.I. (114, 176), is measured for MG 63 cells on smooth titanium and 292 MPa, with a 95% C.I. (267, 306), on roughened titanium. Adhesion strength for S. mutans on smooth titanium is 320 MPa, with a 95% C.I. (304, 333), and remained relatively constant at 332 MPa, with a 95% C.I. (324, 343), on roughened titanium. The calculated Adhesion Index for smooth titanium is 0.451, with a 95% C.I. (0.267, 0.622), which increased to 0.876, with a 95% C.I. (0.780, 0.932), on roughened titanium. Significance The laser spallation technique provides a platform to examine the tradeoffs of adhesion modulators on both biofilm and cell adhesion. This tradeoff is characterized by the Adhesion Index, which is proposed to aid biocompatibility screening and could help improve implantation outcomes. The Adhesion Index is implemented to determine surface factors that promote favorable adhesion of cells greater than biofilms. Here, an Adhesion Index ≫ 1 suggests favorable biocompatibility.","Biofilm, Adhesion, Titanium, Laser spallation, , MG 63, Surface roughness, Implant, Adhesion index, Weibull analysis"

Methods Coronal dentin sections of human molars were used. SLRPs were either decorin (DCN) or biglycan (BGN) in core or proteoglycan form (with glycosaminoglycans, GAGs). Groups were: No treatment (control), DCN core, DCN + GAGs, BGN core, BGN + GAGs. Samples were etched with PA for 15 s and prior to application of Adper Single Bond Plus and composite buildup an aliquot of the specific SLRPs was applied over dentin. Twenty-four hours or 6 months after the bonding procedure, samples were tested for microtensile bond strength (MTBS). Debonded beams were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For remineralization studies, dentin blocks were fully demineralized, infused with the SLRPs, placed in artificial saliva for 2 weeks, and evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results MTBS test presented a mean of 51.4 ± 9.1 MPa in control with no statistically significant difference to DCN core (47.6 ± 8.3) and BGN core (48.3 ± 6.5). The full proteoglycan groups DCN + GAGs (27.4 ± 4.5) and BGN + GAGs (36.4 ± 13.6) showed decreased MTBS compared to control (p < 0.001). At 6 months, control or core-treated samples did not have a statistically significant difference in MTBS. However, SLRPs with GAGs showed statistically significant improvement of bonding (62.5 ± 6.0 for DCN and 52.8 ± 8.1 for BGN, p < 0.001) compared to their baseline values. SEM showed that GAGs seem to favor water retention but overtime help remineralization. TEM of demineralized dentin indicated a larger collagen fibril diameter pattern of samples treated with core proteins compared to control and a smaller diameter with DCN + GAGs in water with evidence of mineralization with DCN + GAGS, BGN core and BGN + GAGs. Significance : In conclusion, core proteins seem not to affect dentin adhesion significantly but the presence of GAGs can be detrimental to immediate bonding. However, after ageing of samples, full proteoglycans, particularly DCN, can significantly improve bonding overtime while promoting remineralization which can prove to be clinically beneficial.","Dentin, Collagen, Electron microscopy, Proteoglycans, Glycosaminoglycans, Remineralization"

Methods 80 polymer-infiltrated ceramic networks Vita Enamic (PICN VE) disc specimens with four different occlusal thicknesses (0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 mm), were produced using a computer-aided design/manufacturing system, and cemented on a stiff (zirconia) or soft (polyamide) substrate of 4-mm thickness. The ten specimens, in soft or stiff groups, were subjected to compressive loading by a MTS machine until fracture or maximum load (4500 N) was reached. The unbroken specimens were examined using optical coherence tomography. Eight axisymmetric finite element models and eight 3D models comprising the four different occlusal thicknesses and two substrates under different vertical loads and sliding movements were constructed. The maximum principal stress was selected to evaluate the stress distribution in this study. Results The fracture resistance of the specimens was significantly different between the two substrates (P < 0.001). Fracture resistance was positively associated with specimen thickness (r = 0.597 and 0.896 for the soft and stiff substrate respectively). Specimens on the soft substrate had lower fracture loads, whilst cone cracks were observed in unbroken samples on different soft/stiff substrate prior to final fracture. The finite element analysis confirmed that samples on the stiff substrate had lower maximum principal stress values than those on the soft substrate. For the maximum principal stress not to exceed the flexural strength of PICN VE, a stiff substrate and minimum thickness of 2.0 mm are required for the prostheses. Significance A minimum 2.0 mm thick, stiff substrate was needed for bruxism as shown by the effect of high/large chewing force on the posterior dentition of monolithic PICN VE crowns.","Contact fracture, Monolithic hybrid ceramic, Finite element analysis"

The specific objective of this study was to evaluate the polymerization kinetics, water sorption and solubility, pH-derived degradation and microtensile bond strength of various monofunctional acrylamides and meth(acrylamides) when copolymerized with dimethacrylates. Methods: Base monomers were added at 60 wt%, and included either BisGMA or UDMA. Monofunctional monomers were added at 40 wt%, including one (meth)acrylate as the control, two secondary methacrylamides and two tertiary acrylamides. DMPA (0.2 wt%) and DPI-PF6 (0.4 wt%)/BHT (0.1 wt%) were added as initiators/inhibitor. Polymerization kinetics wwere followed with near-IR spectroscopy in real time. Water sorption (WS) and solubility (SL) were measured following ISO 4049. Monomer degradation at different pH levels was assessed with 1H NMR. Microtensile bond strength (MTBS) was assessed in caries-free human third molars 48 h and 3 weeks after restorations were placed using solvated BisGMA-based adhesives (40 vol% ethanol). Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA/Tukey’s test (α = 0.05). Results: As expected, rate of polymerization and final degree of conversion (DC) were higher for the acryl versions of each monomer, and decreased with increasing steric hindrance around the vinyl group for each molecule. In general, UDMA copolymerizations were more rapid and extensive than for BisGMA, but this was dependent upon the specific monofunctional monomer added. WS/SL were in general higher for the (meth)acrylamides compared to the (meth)acrylates, except for the tertiary acrylamide, which showed the lowest values. One of the secondary methacrylamides was significantly more stable than the methacrylate control, but the alpha substitutions decreased stability to degradation in acid pH. MTBS in general was higher for the (meth)acrylates. While for all materials the MTBS values at 3 weeks decreased in relation to the 24 h results, the tertiary acrylamide showed no reduction in bond strength. Significance: This study highlights the importance of considering steric and electronic factors when designing monomers for applications where rapid polymerizations are needed, especially when co-polymerizations with other base monomers are required to balance mechanical properties, as is the case with dental adhesives. The results of this investigation will be used to design fully formulated adhesives to be tested in clinically-relevant conditions.","Methacrylamides, Polymerization kinetics, Copolymerization, Phase-separation, Steric hindrance, Polymer network"
