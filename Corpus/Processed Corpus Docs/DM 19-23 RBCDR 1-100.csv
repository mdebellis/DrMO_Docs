Methods Here, the refractive-index-matched monodisperse SiO2 were used as the supporting substrates to synthesize GO-cladded SiO2 spheres (xSiO2 @ yGO) through a mild electrostatic self-assembly process, where x and y represent the amount of SiO2 and GO in the reaction mixture, respectively. The morphology and the optical performance of the obtained xSiO2 @ yGO particles were modulated by varying the mass ratio of SiO2 and GO (5:1, 10:1, 50:1, and 100:1). All developed hybrid particles were silanized and formulated with dimethacrylate-based resins. These were tested for curing depth, polymerization conversion, mechanical performance, in vitro cell viability, and antibacterial activity. Results Of all xSiO2 @ yGO materials, increasing the mass ratio to 100:1 made the 100SiO2 @GO particles appear light brown and possess the lowest light absorbance from 300 to 800 nm. The results of CIEL*a*b* system showed that all these hybrid particles exhibited obvious discoloration compared with SiO2 and GO, where 100SiO2 @GO possessed the smallest color difference. Furthermore, following the results of curing depth, polymerization conversion, and mechanical performance of dental composites, the optimal filler composition was 100SiO2 @GO at 5 wt% filler loading. The resultant 100SiO2 @GO-filled composite produced the highest flexural strength (115 ± 12 MPa) and the lowest bacterial concentration (6.7 × 108 CFU/mL) than those of the resin matrix (78 ± 11 MPa; 9.2 × 108 CFU/mL) and 5 wt% SiO2-filled composite (106 ± 9 MPa; 9.1 × 108 CFU/mL), respectively, without affecting in vitro cell viability. Significance The facile and mild synthesis of xSiO2 @ yGO hybrid particles provided a convenient way to tune their optical property. The optimal 100SiO2 @GO particles could be considered as the promising antibacterial filler to be applied in dental care and therapy.","Refractive index-matched, Optical characteristic, Antibacterial property, Dental resin composite"

Methods Air abrasion was performed on 12 unscathed bovine teeth and 72 luting composite resin discs with 85 μm round-shaped and 50 μm sharp-edged alumina particles applied for 20 s, 40 s and 60 s (n = 12). Air abrasion was standardized by uniform areas of 2 mm diameter, a pressure of 0.25 MPa and a distance of 3 mm. The volume loss was determined by using a laboratory scanner. Results Air abrasion with round-shaped alumina particles was mostly not measurable with the laboratory scanner, while sharp-edged alumina air abrasion resulted in significant loss of enamel. The median of volume loss by sharp-edged alumina particles ranged from 0.78 mm3 (20 s) to 2.52 mm3 (60 s). In contrast to round-shaped alumina the removal caused by sharp-edged alumina increased significantly with increasing application times (p ≤ 0.05). For air abrasion on luting composite resin the median of the removed volume ranged from 2.25 mm3 (20 s) to 6.18 mm3 (60 s), while round-shaped alumina showed a range from 0.45 mm3 (20 s) to 1.40mm3 (60 s). The round-shaped alumina produced a statistically significant lower volume loss than sharp-edged alumina for all three air abrasion times. Significance The 85 μm round-shaped alumina particles removed less composite resin than 50 μm sharp-edged alumina particles but barely any enamel, making it an option for removing composite resin residues from enamel.","Air abrasion, Alumina particle morphology, Round-shaped alumina, Sharp-edged alumina, Enamel loss, Surface damage, Volume loss, Removal, Composite remnants, Luting composite resin"

Methods Disc-shaped specimens (n=15; Ø=10mm; thickness=1.0mm) were produced from CAD/CAM blocks as follows: feldspathic (FEL); leucite (LEU); lithium disilicate (LD); zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZRLS); polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN); and resin nanoceramic (RNC). Adhesive cementation was performed onto epoxy discs (dentin analogue- Ø=10mm; thickness=2.5mm). The cemented assemblies were subjected to fatigue testing using a step–stress approach (400N–2200N; step-size of 200N; 10,000 cycles per step; 1.4Hz). Fatigue data were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier and Mantel–Cox (log-rank) tests (p<0.05) and Weibull statistical analysis. Fractographic analysis was also performed. Results All RNC specimens survived the fatigue test (100% probability of survival at 2200N; 100,000 cycles) and presented occlusal deformation in response to loading, while all other tested materials failed in distinct loading steps with radial cracks starting from the bonding surface. LD (1146.7N; 47,333) and ZRLS (1013.3N; 40,666) materials obtained the highest fatigue failure loads and cycles until failure, meanwhile all PICN specimens failed during the first step (0% probability of survival at 400N; 10,000). FEL had similar Weibull modulus to LD and ZRLS and higher than LEU for both load and number of cycles outcomes.

Methods Patients (n = 91) receiving LidiSi (73.1%) and RBC (36.9%) inlays/onlays/overlays between 2007 and 2017 were selected. The restorations were evaluated using the modified U.S. Public Health Service criteria. The survival of the restorations was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. Factors affecting the occurrence of deficiencies were examined by logistic regression analysis. This was performed with the use of the Generalized Estimating Equation model including Repeated measurements (GEER), with the consideration that the same patient had several teeth in the sample. Risk estimation was conducted for each evaluated criterion (p < 0.05). Results The survival of LidiSi and RBC restorations were 96.8% and 84.9%, respectively after a mean observation period of 7.8 ± 3.3 years. The annual failure rate was 0.2% for LidiSi and 1.0% for RBC. The probability of survival was above 98% for both restorations in the first 6 years, however, it dropped to 60% for RBC by the end of the 15th year. For both materials the reasons for failure included secondary caries, restoration fracture, and endodontic complication. In addition, LidiSi also failed due to tooth fracture, while RBC due to marginal gap formation and loss of retention. Among the evaluated risk factors, material of restoration (OR=6.8, CI95%:3.1–14.9), oral hygiene (OR=8.0, CI95%: 2.9–22.1], and bruxism (OR=1.9, CI95%: 1.1–3.3) showed a significant impact on the evaluated criteria. Significance LidiSi and RBC restorations showed similarly excellent 6-year survival, however, in the long term significantly more failures should be expected for RBCs.","Lithium disilicate, Resin composite, Indirect restoration, Clinical performance"

This study investigated the application method on bulk-fill resin composite polymerization shrinkage. Methods Occluso-proximal class-II cavities were prepared in 40 molars and bonded with a self-etch adhesive (Adhese Universal). The study groups varied according to the resin composite application: group-1: bulk application, Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill (TBF); group-2: proximal wall construction (TBF) and occlusal cavity filling (TBF); group-3: thin flowable liner layer, Tetric EvoFlow Bulk Fill (TEF) and bulk filling (TBF); group-4: flowable liner (TEF), proximal wall (TBF), occlusal cavity (TBF); and group-5: bulk application, SDR (3 mm) and capping layer (TBF, 1 mm). Each resin composite increment was scanned twice using micro-CT (uncured, cured 40 s) at a resolution of 16 µm. Shrinkage vectors and volumetric polymerization shrinkage were evaluated and statistically analyzed (one-way ANOVA). SEM images were used to investigate the tooth-restoration interface. Results Shrinkage vectors differed significantly among the groups and were greatest in gp5-fl/SDR (47.6 µm), followed by gp1-TBF (23.8 µm) and least in gp5-fl/SDR+TBF (11.1 µm). Volumetric shrinkage varied significantly with the use of SDR (gp5-fl/SDR: 2.6%) and TEF (gp4-fl/TEF: 2.5%) to TBF (gp4-fl/TEF+wl/TBF: 0.6%) in the incremental application. Significance Building a proximal resin composite wall yielded smaller shrinkage vectors than the bulk application. Applying a thin flowable liner decreased the shrinkage vectors, even more when building a proximal wall. A thin flowable liner is recommended when building a proximal resin composite wall.","Bulk-fill resin composites, Shrinkage vectors, Volumetric polymerization shrinkage, Class-II restoration, Flowable liner, Cavity boundaries"

Methods Five LCUs and nine exposure conditions were used. The laser LCU (Monet) used for 1 s and 3 s, the quad-wave LCU (PinkWave) used for 3 s in the Boost and 20 s in the Standard modes, the the multi-peak LCU (Valo X) used for 5 s in the Xtra and 20 s in the Standard modes, were compared to the polywave PowerCure used in the 3 s mode and for 20 s in the Standard mode, and to the mono-peak SmartLite Pro used for 20 s. Two paste consistency bulk-fill RBCs: Filtek One Bulk Fill Shade A2 (3 M), Tetric PowerFill Shade IVA (Ivoclar Vivadent), and two flowable RBCs: Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable Shade A2 (3 M), Tetric PowerFlow Shade IVA (Ivoclar Vivadent) were photo-cured in 4-mm deep x 4-mm diameter metal molds. The light received by these specimens was measured using a spectrometer (Flame-T, Ocean Insight), and the radiant exposure delivered to the top surface of the RBCs was mapped. The immediate degree of conversion (DC) at the bottom, and the 24-hour Vickers Hardness (VH) at the top and bottom of the RBCs were measured and compared. Results The irradiance received by the 4-mm diameter specimens ranged from 1035 mW/cm2 (SmartLite Pro) to 5303 mW/cm2 (Monet). The radiant exposures between 350 and 500 nm delivered to the top surface of the RBCs ranged from 5.3 J/cm2 (Monet in 1 s) to 26.4 J/cm2 (Valo X), although the PinkWave delivered 32.1 J/cm2 in 20 s 350 to 900 nm. All four RBCs achieved their maximum DC and VH values at the bottom when photo-cured for 20 s. The Monet used for 1 s and the PinkWave used for 3 s on the Boost setting delivered the lowest radiant exposures between 420 and 500 nm (5.3 J/cm2 and 3.5 J/cm2 respectively), and they produced the lowest DC and VH values. Conclusions Despite delivering a high irradiance, the short 1 or 3-s exposures delivered less energy to the RBC than 20-s exposures from LCUs that deliver> 1000 mW/cm2. There was an excellent linear correlation (r > 0.98) between the DC and the VH at the bottom. There was a logarithmic relationship between the DC and the radiant exposure (Pearson's r = 0.87-97) and between the VH and the radiant exposure (Pearson's r = 0.92–0.96) delivered in the 420-500 nm range.","Dental curing lights, Dental laser, Resin-based composites, Photo-curing, Degree of conversion, Vickers hardness"

Methods Six flowable, five conventional packable, and one thermo-viscous bulk-fill resin composites were heated up to 54°C in a plate-plate rheometer to determine their complex viscosity. Normal force measurements were carried out for the six packable materials to determine the unplugging force and unplugging work (stickiness) over the same temperature range. Data were analyzed using Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test, one-way ANOVA and Tukey Post Hoc test with α=0.05 as level of significance. Results At 23°C packable composites showed viscosity between 6.75 and 19.14kPas, while flowable composites presented significantly lower viscosities between 1.31 and 2.20kPas. Pre-heating led to a drop of 30–82% in the viscosity of packable materials. The thermo-viscous material dropped to the level of flowables at 45 and 54°C thus behaving as a packable composite at room temperature with flowable-like viscosity at higher temperatures. No statistically significant differences for viscosity were observed among flowable composites at any temperature. The unplugging force decreased for packable composites, while their unplugging work generally increased at elevated temperature. At 23°C unplugging force was measured between 7.50 and 19.18N, while pre-heating up to 54°C led to values between 2.9 and 6.2N. Regarding unplugging work at 23°C the calculated values were between 3.0 and 8.9×10−3J and at 54°C between 8.8 and 13.0×10−3J. Significance Pre-heating significantly reduced viscosity of highly viscous resin composites, while no influence was shown for flowable composites. In general stickiness, measured as unplugging work, increased at elevated temperatures. The thermo-viscous material showed low viscosity comparable to flowable composites at 45 and 54°C, yet its stickiness did not increase significantly compared to the values at 23°C.","Resin composite, Pre-heating, Rheology, Handling properties, Viscosity, Stickiness, Temperature, Activation energy"

Methods Five types of SRDs (SRD-0: S-PRG fillers 0 wt%; SRD-1: S-PRG fillers 9.1 wt%; SRD-2: S-PRG fillers 18.4 wt%; SRD-3: S-PRG fillers 27.8 wt%; and SRD-6: S-PRG fillers 57.4 wt%) were prepared, and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was used as control (n = 8). Direct pulp capping was performed on rats that were sacrificed for further evaluation 2 or 4 weeks after the operation. The pulp tissue disorganization (PTD), inflammatory cell infiltration (ICI), and reparative dentin formation were histopathologically evaluated; the data were statistically analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis and the Mann–Whitney U tests. Results The histopathological evaluation of SRD-1-treated test animals 2 weeks post-operation revealed inferior PTD and ICI when compared with that of MTA. Even 4 weeks after the operation in SRD-1- and SRD-2-treated rats, the PTD and ICI were inferior when compared with those of MTA. The dental specimens of SRD-0 and MTA showed orthodentin formation, whereas SRD-treated test animals showed osteodentin formation at a position slightly deeper than the site of the pulpal exposure. Significance The reparative dentin formed by SRD-0 and MTA was genuine, whereas that formed by SRD-3 and SRD-6 was ossified and ectopic.

The influence of irradiance, exposure distance, light curing unit (LCU) angulation and direction of polymerization is analyzed when curing through crowns of different thicknesses. Methods Three modern CAD/CAM resin-based composites (RBCs) were used to produce 45 crown-shaped specimens. The distance between fissure and crown base was set at 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mm (n = 5). Transmitted irradiance, while using a violet-blue LCU, was measured with a photo-spectrometer. 180 exposure conditions per specimen were investigated by variation in LCU curing mode, angulation, exposure distance and direction. Data was analyzed using univariate ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD (α = 0.05) and comparison of 95% confidence intervals. Results The CAD/CAM-RBC’s decadic absorption coefficient ranges from 0.317 mm−1 to 0.387 mm−1 and the reflection correcting factor for crowns ranges from 0.305 to 0.337. Transmitted irradiance decreases significantly with increasing exposure distance and decreasing incident irradiance. For tilt angles greater than 10°, transmitted irradiances are significantly reduced (−11% for 20°, −23% for 30°). Significantly lowest transmitted irradiances were measured for vestibular curing direction (up to −15%). Significance A calculation model can predict the transmitted irradiance through a CAD/CAM restoration in dependence of restoration thickness and radiant emittance. The practitioner can be supported by this model to adapt material choice of dental restoration and adhesive system to the individual situation. Variation in exposure conditions shows negative effect on the transmission of light and should be limited.","CAD/CAM, Composite crown, Resin-based composite, Correction model, Light curing, Irradiance, Transmission"

Therefore, the aim of the study was to create a biocompatible and highly translucent resin-based composite, and to investigate the effect of material thickness on translucency. Methods A biocompatible ORMOCER® resin matrix was reinforced with dental glass powder as fillers. To reach a high translucency, refractive index matching of the matrix and fillers was done in the two ways: (1) Highly refractive ZrO2 nanoparticles were incorporated into the resin. (2) The resin was modified via addition of 4-Methylthiophenol. The corresponding refractive indices were acquired on an Abbe refractometer (n = 5). In both cases, the dental glass powder was added and translucency of the resulting minifilled and nanohybrid composites were measured using spectral photometry (n = 5). Additionally, the translucency of the experimental composites was determined as a function of specimen thickness in the range 10 μm–2 mm (n = 5). One-way ANOVA was performed to determine the significant differences in various optical parameters among different amounts of modifications and thicknesses at α = 0.05. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests (extract and direct contact tests) were conducted according to ISO 10993 to classify the biocompatibility of the composites (n = 6). Results The translucency values of the composites with 47 wt.-% dental glass powder and a specimen thickness of 2 mm, could be increased from 26% up to 71% by increasing the refractive index of the matrix through incorporating ZrO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, it can also be increased to 67% via addition of 4-Methylthiophenol. Further results showed that the translucency significantly depended on the sample thickness following an exponential function. The effect of all tested parameters was significant among the materials (p < 0.001). The composites did not show any cytotoxic effect. Significance Highly translucent and biocompatible resin composites were developed. They show attractive properties for the use as dental enamel material in direct and indirect restorations.","Translucency, Minifilled composite, Nanohybrid composite, Dental resin composite, Biocompatibility, Resin matrix"

Methods Five resin-based composites (RBC) and an additional RBC, Viscalor, used with a Caps Warmer (VOCO, Germany) were studied. The extrusion force (N) and extruded mass (g) were measured from Viscalor compules heated in T3 mode for 30s (T3-30s) and 3min (T3-3min). For stickiness and packability measurements, RBCs were packed into a brass cylindrical cavity controlled at 22 and 37°C. A flat-ended probe was lowered into the RBC pastes at constant speed. Stickiness: Fmax (N) and Ws (N mm), and packability: Fp (N), were measured. Viscalor was LED photo-cured at 1200mW/cm2 for 40s. The degrees of conversion at 5min and 24h post cure (DC5min and DC24h) of Viscalor (no heat, T3-30s and T3-3min) were measured by ATR-FTIR. Data were analysed by one-way ANOVA, independent t-test and Tukey post-hoc tests (p<0.05). Results The maximum temperature of the Caps Warmer, in T3 mode, reached 68°C in 20min. Viscalor temperatures of 34.5°C and 60.6°C were recorded after 30s and 3min pre-heating, respectively. Pre-heating significantly reduced extrusion force and increased extruded mass, especially after 3min. RBCs varied in Fmax, Ws and Fp (p<0.05). Temperature also affected Fmax (p=0.000), Ws (p=0.002) and Fp (p=0.000). Pre-heating Viscalor for either 30s or 3min did not increase the post-cure DC at either 5min or 24h, relative to no pre-heating (p>0.05). Significance The composites varied to an extent in stickiness and packability but the overall magnitudes remained within a clinically acceptable range.

Methods PMMA CAD/CAM blocks (Vita Temp/Vita) were sectioned and served as a Control. Four 3DRs (Cosmos-SLA/Yller, Cosmos-DLP/Yller, PriZma-Bioprov/Makertech, Nanolab/Wilcos) were obtained as discs (15-mm diameter, 2.5-mm thickness) in three orientations (0°, 45°, and 90°) using different 3D printers (Form 2/Formlabs, P30/Straumann, Hunter/Flashforge, W3D/Wilcos, respectively). Samples were then cleaned with isopropyl alcohol prior to post-curing in specific post-curing units. Half of the samples’ surface was covered with an adhesive tape and submitted to 10,000 toothbrushing (TB) cycles. The Gs and Sa at the brushed and not brushed surfaces were evaluated with a glossmeter (Novo-curve) and a laser confocal microscope (OLS5000) (n = 10), which also obtained the Rv and 3D representative images of the interface between not brushed and brushed surfaces. Electron microscopy images of the surface of some samples was also performed (n = 3). On another set of samples (n = 5), the coordinates of luminosity and color were obtained with a spectrophotometer (Easyshade V) at baseline and after 16.7 h and 200 h of UVB aging, to calculate the ∆E00 using CIEDE:2000 formula. Additionally, 3DRs photoinitiators were identified using a minispectrometer (USB2000 +) (n = 5). Data of Gs and Sa were submitted to three-way-, Rv to two-way-, and ∆E00 to mixed-ANOVA tests, followed by Tukey’s test (α = 0.05). For all variables, results from experimental groups were compared to control using Dunnett’s test (α = 0.05). Student’s t-test was used to compare the control at different TB cycles (Gs, Sa) or aging periods (∆E00) (α = 0.05). Results Build orientation of 3DRs did not influence any of the variables studied. The 10,000 TB cycles resulted in a decrease in Gs and increase in Sa for all resins tested. The control showed higher Gs after 10,000 TB cycles than Cosmos-SLA and Nanolab resins. Compared to all 3DRs, Control presented lower ∆E00 after 200 h of UVB aging. All 3DRs presented higher ∆E00 than the clinically acceptable after 200 h of UVB aging. Lucirin® TPO was identified in all 3DRs, although PriZma might also present other photoinitiators and Nanolab might present Irgacure 369. Significance Alterations in build orientation are very useful and frequently performed in the day-today of 3D-printing, thus its effect in the optical properties and in the topography of 3D-printed restorations is very relevant. For the evaluated 3D-printed provisional resins, build orientation did not influence any of the variables studied (Gs, Sa, Rv, and ∆E00), even after toothbrushing cycles and UVB aging.","Three-dimensional printing, CAD-CAM, Interim dental prostheses, Laser scanning confocal microscopy, Color"

Methods Data were retrieved from a clinical practice’s records and were anonymized typed into electronic files. All veneer information was recorded, including previous restorations, repairs or failures, materials used, dates, patient, and age. Results We analyzed 1459 veneer restorations, of which 1043 (71.5%) were direct composite, and 416 (28.5%) were ceramic, placed in 341 patients. The mean patients’ age was 47.8 years, and the mean number of restorations per patient was 4.3 restorations. During all follow-up, 957 (65.6%) veneers were successful without any repair, 252 (17.3%) were repaired and still in place, and 250 (17.1%) had a failure that resulted in replacement. Replacements were usually carried out with the same material placed at first. Considering success analysis, annual failure rates (AFR) for veneers in 5 and 10 years were 9.1% and 10% for direct composite and 2.9% and 2.8% for ceramic, respectively. Survival analysis showed AFR of 3.9% and 4.1% for composite and 1.4% and 1.2% for ceramic at the same periods. Cox regression was made for both success and survival outcomes. Composite veneers presented a higher risk of failure than ceramic veneers with higher hazard ratios for survival (HR) [HR 4.00 (2.74–5.83)] and success [HR 5.16 (2.65–10.04)].

Method Bi-layered samples of different clinically relevant thicknesses were created using shades of VITAPAN Excell (VE), VITAPAN Dentine (VD) and VITA Physiodens (VP), combined with their corresponding enamel shades. Spectral reflectance of all samples was measured over a black background using a non-contact spectroradiometer with CIE 45∘∕0∘ geometry. Two different PCA-based models, built from two different configurations of known samples, were proposed to reconstruct the spectral data and color of unknown layered samples. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Goodness of Fit (GFC), as well as ΔE00 with corresponding 50:50% acceptability and perceptibly thresholds (AT and PT) were used as performance assessment. Results The 5-samples training set approach provided an average RMSE < 0.015 and GFC > 0.999 when measured and predicted spectral reflectances were compared, while for the 9-samples training set, RMSE < 0.0098 and GFC > 0.9999 were obtained.

This study offers a comparative characterization of the mechanical and cytotoxic behavior of such materials that use different techniques to adjust their optical properties (e.g., structural color instead of pigment addition), have different filler systems but are based on a comparable organic matrix. Methods The structural appearance of the filler systems was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Various quasi-static and viscoelastic parameters were evaluated at clinically relevant frequencies (0.5–5 Hz) using an instrumented indentation test with a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) module. Cytotoxicity on human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1), when exposed to eluates from tested RBCs specimens (up to one month), was assessed using a WST-1 colorimetric proliferation assay. Multifactor analysis of variance was applied to compare the parameters of interest (Martens, Vickers, and indentation hardness; elastic and total indentation work; creep, indentation depth; storage, loss, and indentation moduli; loss factor; cell viability) between analyzed RBCs, loading frequencies, and eluate age. Results Structural particularities of the filler systems are directly reflected in the mechanical behavior of the analyzed materials. Changes in the filler system, necessary to achieve structural color, generally resulted in lower mechanical properties but a better ability to absorb shock. In contrast, the cytotoxicity was comparable. Significance Based on the performed characterization, universal chromatic RBCs fits in the conventional RBCs class to expect comparable clinical behavior.","Resin-based composites, Dental, Universal chromatic materials, Structural color, Dynamic-mechanical analysis, Cell toxicity"

A combination of an adhesive and flowable composite with bulk fill composite (model A), of a glass ionomer cement with bulk fill composite (model B) and of an adhesive with bulk fill composite (model C), were considered. Starting from CAD models, 3D-finite element (FE) models were created and analyzed. Solid food was modeled on the occlusal surface and slide-type contact elements were used between tooth surface and food. Polymerization shrinkage was simulated for the composite materials. Physiological masticatory loads were applied to these systems combined with shrinkage. Static linear analyses were carried out. The maximum normal stress criterion was adopted as a measure of potential damage. Results All models exhibited high stresses principally located along the tooth tissues–restoration interfaces. All models showed a similar stress trend along enamel–restoration interface, where stresses up to 22MPa and 19MPa was recorded in the enamel and restoration, respectively. A and C models showed a similar stress trend along the dentin-restoration interface with a lower stress level in model A, where stresses up to 11.5MPa and 7.5MPa were recorded in the dentin and restoration, respectively, whereas stresses of 17MPa and 9MPa were detected for model C.

Specimens were prepared within 4mm diameter cylindrical molds, of either 1mm or 4mm depths respectively, to simulate near-surface and deep locations in a bulk-fill restoration. The independent variables in this study were: materials, thickness and time. Two high irradiance polymerization protocols were utilized for PowerCure materials: 2000 and 3050mW/cm2 for 5 and 3s, respectively. A standard (1200mW/cm2) polymerization protocol was used with control materials. FTIR was utilized to measure DC in real-time for 24h post-irradiation.

Failures and interventions over time were investigated using the dental records. A follow-up clinical recall was carried out in 2020. Two scenarios were considered: restorations that did not require any intervention (success) or restorations that were repaired and still functional (survival). Multivariate Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves were performed using success and survival rates (p < 0.05). Results One hundred patient records and 683 restorations were included. A total of 353 failures were reported (success rate= 48%). Main reasons for failure were fracture and secondary caries. Most interventions after failures were repairs. Replacements were registered in 183 cases (survival rate= 73%). Annual failure rates were below 2.5% (success) and 1.1% (survival). Larger restorations and maxillary molars had higher failure risks. No significant differences in success rates among different resin composites was observed. A typical observation in this sample of restorations was the presence of moderate to advanced signs of aging, including marginal and surface staining, wear, chipping, changes in anatomical shape and translucency. Clearly aged restorations were still clinically satisfactory.

Seven modern CAD/CAM resin-based composites (RBCs) and one CAD/CAM glass-ceramic (control group) were sectioned and polished into specimens of 0.5–5mm thickness (in 0.5mm steps, n=6). Irradiance of a violet-blue LED light curing unit (LCU) (power modes: Standard, High and Plasma) was measured after passing through each specimen with a spectrometer. Data was compared based on 95% confidence intervals and using univariate ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD (α=0.05). Results The measured transmitted irradiance passing through the specimens decreased exponentially. Significantly highest values of transmitted irradiance were measured for 0.5mm thick specimens for all materials (p<0.05). The decadic absorption coefficient for CAD/CAM-RBCs ranged from 0.292mm−1 to 0.387mm−1 while the control group (glass-ceramic) reached a significantly lower value of 0.283mm−1. The reflection ratio for all materials ranged from 12.6% to 18.5%. Significance A correction can be implemented to predict the true transmitted irradiance after passing through a dental restoration as function of initial irradiance, specimen thickness and material specific parameters.

Half of the specimens (n = 12) were loaded for 1,200,000 cycles (50 N, 1.3 Hz, TC: 5/55 °C, 6000×) and examined for failures. Fracture load was measured according to ISO standard 14801, BM was calculated, and fracture types were examined. Data were analyzed using parametric statistics (p < 0.05). Results No failures were observed after 600,000 cycles. After 1,200,000 cycles, wear traces were recorded in all groups except PM, VE and CC on TiB implants. In group CC on NTiB implants, three specimens were rated zero in BM testing as they showed fracture of the screw. Regarding BM, TiB implants exhibited higher values than NTiB implants with aged CC (p = 0.023), aged PM (p < 0.001), initial PM (p = 0.011) and initial VE (p < 0.001). No differences occurred among the implant types with initial CC, initial ND, aged ND and aged VE. With regard to initial BM values, NTiB implants showed higher values for ND and CC compared with PM and VE (p < 0.001). No differences in initial BM values were found for the tested materials on TiB implants (p > 0.116). When aged, restoration material had no impact on the BM values of NTiB implants (p ≥ 0.233). Aged TiB implants showed higher values in combination with CC than with ND (p = 0.001). PM and VE showed similar values as ND and CC. Artificial aging led to a decrease of BM within PM, CC and ND on NTiB implants and ND on TiB implants. The majority of failures after testing were characterized by crown fractures in two to four pieces. Fractures in more pieces with smaller fragments occurred primarily for ND. Significance The use of NTiB implants with the polymer-based materials tested can only be recommended for clinical use as interim prostheses. CC seems to show a positive effect on the BM.

KIc was determined using the Compact-Tension (C(T)) method and σ0 and cyclic fatigue were tested using the Ball-on-Three-Balls assembly. Additional disc-shaped specimens (n = 5) were produced to obtain water sorption curves of the materials. Weibull statistics and two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test were used for data assessment. Results The highest water sorption was observed for LavaTM Ultimate (42.6 μg/mm3), whereas Grandio SO displayed the lowest uptake (14 μg/mm3). A statistically significant drop in KIc and σ0 was measured for all materials after water storage, except for the σ0 of CerasmartTM. Water ageing had a dissimilar effect on the cyclic fatigue behavior, increasing the slow crack growth susceptibility of LavaTM Ultimate, but decreasing it for CerasmartTM and Brilliant Crios. Significance Contemporary CAD/CAM resin composites are susceptible to water driven degradative processes, although differences in filler content and resin matrix constitution play an important role in how it impacts their mechanical properties.","Resin composite, CAD/CAM, Water sorption, Hydrolytic degradation, Biaxial strength, Fracture toughness, Cyclic fatigue"

However, the long-term fatigue behaviour of these self-healing composites has still been hardly investigated. Therefore, this manuscript studied the fatigue behaviour of self-healing composites containing microcapsules by subjecting the specimens to traditional staircase tests and ageing in a custom-designed chewing simulator (Rub&Roll) to simulate oral ageing physiologically relevant conditions. Methods To prepare self-healing composite, poly(urea-formaldehyde) microcapsules containing acrylic self-healing liquids were synthesized. Subsequently, these microcapsules (10 wt%) and initiator (benzoyl peroxide, BPO, 2 wt%) were incorporated into a commercial flowable resin-based composite. Microcapsule-free resin-based composites with and without BPO were also prepared as control specimens. A three-point flexural test was used to measure the initial flexural strength (Sinitial). Subsequently, half of the specimens were used for fatigue testing using a common staircase approach to measure the fatigue strengths (FS). In addition, the other specimens were aged in the Rub&Roll machine for four weeks where after the final flexural strength (Sfinal) was measured. Results Compared to Sinitial, FS of all tested specimens significantly decreased as measured through staircase testing. After 4 weeks of ageing in the Rub&Roll machine, Sfinal was significantly reduced compared to Sinitial for microcapsule-free resin-based composites, but not for the self-healing composites (p = 0.3658). However, the self-healing composites are still in the experimental phase characterized by a low mechanical strength, which still impedes further clinical translation. Significance Self-healing composites containing microcapsules exhibit improved fatigue resistance compared to microcapsule-free non-self-healing composites.","Self-healing composites, Fatigue behaviour, Staircase test, Chewing simulator (Rub&Roll), Fatigue strength, Flexural strength"

Methods TiO2 nanostructures were synthesized and functionalized, using 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTMS) and 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TSMPM). Characterizations were performed with XRD, EDS, TEM, and TGA. Resin composites containing Bis-GMA/TEGDMA, CQ, DABE, and barium-aluminum silicate glass were produced according to TiO2 nanostructure (nanotube or nanoparticle), concentration (0.3 or 0.9 wt%), and functionalization (APTMS or TSMPM). The resin composite without nanostructures was used as control. The amount of fillers was kept constant at 78.3 wt% for all materials. The degree of conversion (DC - at 0 h and 24 h), maximum polymerization rate (Rpmax), and Knoop microhardness (KHN before and after ethanol softening) were evaluated. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Tukey's HSD (α = 0.05). Results TGA results demonstrated that functionalizations were effective for both nanostructures. For DC, resin composites, time and interaction effect were significant (p < 0.001). Higher DC was found for 0.3-wt%-functionalized-nanotubes at 24 h. For nanoparticles, only 0.9-wt%-non-functionalized and 0.3-wt%-APTMS-functionalized showed DC similar to the control and all other groups showed higher DC (p < 0.05). Rpmax was higher for 0.3-wt%-APTMS-nanotubes, which corresponded to higher DC after 24 h. The lowest Rpmax occurred for 0.9-wt%-TSMPM-nanotubes, which showed smaller DC at 0 h. For KHN, resin composites, ethanol softening and interaction effect were significant (p < 0.001). KHN decreased after ethanol softening all groups, except for 0.3-wt%-TSMPM-nanotubes, 0.9-wt%-TSMPM-nanotubes, and 0.3-wt%-non-functionalized-nanoparticles.

Methods Specimens were produced from an amalgam, a direct resin composite, two indirect resin composites, a hybrid ceramic, and a feldspar ceramic and stored for 3 months in tap water (37 °C). All specimens were then sandblasted (Al2O3; 25 μm) and either treated with Monobond Plus and OptiBond FL Adhesive (MP-OFL) or with Scotchbond Universal (SBU).

Methods A previous 3D implant model was edited to receive a cement-retained posterior crown manufactured with different CAD/CAM materials (Estelite P Block, Estelite Block II or Estelite Layered Block). Each solid model was exported to the computer-aided engineering software and submitted to the finite element analysis of stress and strain. Material properties were assigned to each solid with isotropic and homogeneous behavior according to the manufacturer information.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a novel multifunctional composite with antibacterial function and calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) ion release, and (2) investigate the effects on enamel demineralization and hardness at the margins under biofilms. Methods Dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) were incorporated into composite. Four groups were tested: (1) Commercial control (Heliomolar), (2) Experimental control (0% DMAHDM + 0% NACP), (3) antibacterial group (3% DMAHDM + 0% NACP), (D) antibacterial and remineralizing group (3% DMAHDM + 30% NACP). Mechanical properties and Ca and P ion release were measured. Colony-forming units (CFU), lactic acid and polysaccharide of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) biofilms were evaluated. Demineralization of bovine enamel with restorations was induced via S. mutans, and enamel hardness was measured. Data were analyzed via one-way and two-way analyses of variance and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Results Adding DMAHDM and NACP into composite did not compromise the mechanical properties (P > 0.05). Ca and P ion release of 3% DMAHDM + 30% NACP was increased at cariogenic low pH. Biofilm lactic acid and polysaccharides were greatly decreased via DMAHDM, and CFU was reduced by 4 logs (P < 0.05). Under biofilm acids, enamel hardness at the margins was decreased to about 0.5 GPa for control; it was about 1 GPa for antibacterial group, and 1.3 GPa for antibacterial and remineralizing group (P < 0.05). Conclusions The novel 3% DMAHDM + 30% NACP composite had strong antibacterial effects. It substantially reduced enamel demineralization adjacent to restorations under biofilm acid attacks, yielding enamel hardness that was 2-fold greater than that of control composites. The novel multifunctional composite is promising to inhibit recurrent caries.","Recurrent caries, Demineralizaiton and remineralization, Antibacterial, Nanocomposite, Biofilms, Enamel hardness."

Methods Composite restorations (Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill) were placed in standardized Class II two-surface cavities in first upper acrylic molars. The surfaces were roughened by sandblasting (50μm, 1bar). The tooth was mounted on a tailor-made device with a 3D force sensor (Kistler, Z21134-300, 10Hz). Ten dentists (7 male, 3 female) polished one Class II restoration each using the one-step polishing system OptraPol together with a dental handpiece and water spray. The dentists were allowed to use all shapes of the polishing system (small flame, large flame, cup, lens). During polishing, the press-on forces measured for up to 2 minutes. Simultaneously, the polishing procedure was recorded with a digital camera to correlate the forces with the polishing shapes and movements. Results In total, 17,999 force measurements were available for analysis. The mean forces of all operators varied between 0.77(±0.63) N and 2.23(±1.48) N; the difference was statistically significant (ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey B, p<0.05). All dentists exerted maximum forces higher than 3 N (between 3.3N and 18.3N). Force values exceeded 2N during 25% of the polishing time. Female dentists polished with a statistically significant lower force than male dentists (ANOVA, p<0.001). Polishing with the large flame and the cup generated significantly higher forces than polishing with the small flame and the lens (ANOVA, post hoc Tukey B, p<0.01). Conclusions The press-on forces applied during polishing varied significantly between dentists and within the same dentist. In about 25% of the polishing time, forces were above the 2N limit, which is recommended by some manufacturers as the maximum polishing force. Test institutes and manufacturers should evaluate the polishing performance of polishing instruments with various press-on forces.","Polishing, Press-on force, Composite resin, 3D force sensor"

Methods Cylindrical specimens of three commercially available resin composites, three diameters (4, 5 and 6.3mm) and four thicknesses (2, 3, 5 and 6.5mm) were tested. Curing was applied using a LED light for 40s. Microscopic images (32×) of the specimens before and after curing were analyzed to determine the lateral shrinkage profile along the vertical axis. Boundary-layer thickness was determined from the point where lateral shrinkage displacement first reached the maximum value found at mid-thickness. Results Lateral shrinkage displacement at mid-thickness was close to the theoretical value based on published shrinkage-strain data, with the ratio between experimental and theoretical values being 1.04±0.06. The boundary-layer thickness was found to be proportional to specimen diameter only, independent of material, C-factor, and specimen thickness. The proportionality constant was 0.64±0.07, which was approximately 3 times that of the effective value indicated by shrinkage strain/stress calculations. Significance This study validates the assumption made in the shrinkage-stress theory recently proposed and provides a more precise and mechanistic interpretation for the C-factor, i.e. the C-factor, as a measure of a specimen's constraint, is the ratio between the boundary-layer thickness and the total thickness of the specimen.","Composite resins, Shrinkage strain, C-factor, Boundary layer"

Two different adhesive systems were used: etch-&-rinse (ER) or self-etch (SE). Methods Posterior dental teeth of 72 participants (n = 236), with a cavity depth of at least 3 mm, were randomly divided into four groups. Restorations were applied with either Tetric N-Bond or Tetric N-Bond SE. The composite resin Tetric N-Ceram Bulk-Fill was placed either with IF or BF. Restorations were evaluated using FDI criteria at baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon Signed rank test (a=0.05).

Methods Six BF and two non-BF resin-composites were selected. The unset pastes were inserted into white acetal molds (5mm id) with (n=6) depths (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6mm). Three light curing units (LCUs) of increasing radiant emittance capability: 1200, 2000 and 3200mW/cm2 were used. Composite specimen groups (n=3, per depth, per LCU) were irradiated on the upper surface only. For each specific composite, the irradiation times for each LCU were reduced reciprocally, as the LCU irradiance increased, to deliver a constant energy density (J/cm2) to that composite. However, the required energy density for a given composite differed in accordance with each composite manufacturer recommendations. After storing for 24h at 37°C, light transmission measurements were made through each specimen and re-expressed as Apparent Absorbance (A′). Vickers hardness (HV) measurements (n=10) were made on both top and bottom surfaces, for each specimen, and HV versus “depth” profile plots created. From the top-surface data, a Depth-of-Cure parameter could be derived. Data were statistically evaluated for differences between top and bottom HV values and for other predefined variables of interest. Results Irradiation with the LCU of 1200mW/cm2 generally gave the highest HV/depth for most materials tested compared to the other curing lights with higher power output, regardless of top and bottom measurements (p<0.001). However, this difference was material-dependent. With one BF composite, 1200 and 2000mW/cm2 irradiance did not show a significant difference between top and bottom HV. Composites with higher translucency showed reduced differences in top/bottom HV than more opaque composites. Significance Reciprocity was found to be limited with most materials examined, such that irradiance periods of 10s, gave generally better HV outcomes than by using LCUs of superior radiant emittance while reciprocally reducing irradiance time to maintain constant dose of energy density.","Bulk fill, Resin composite, Irradiation regimes, Exposure duration, Reciprocity, Vickers hardness, Hardness depth profile"

Dental resin was incrementally impregnated with γ-MPS modified nanoparticles at different concentrations (0, 1, 3, and 5 wt%). Specimens were printed, post-cured and placed in artificial saliva at 37 oC for 48 h or aged for 3 months. Discrepancy in composition and roughness were monitored using FTIR and AFM, respectively. Biocompatibility was evaluated using human oral fibroblasts. Antimicrobials capacity and biofilm adhesion were measured with Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. Results The microscopic and spectroscopic analyses confirmed γ-MPS coating around ZrO2 nanoparticles. The addition of nanoparticles (>1 wt%) significantly increased the surface roughness. Cytotoxicity results were in agreement with the recommended range of oral biomaterials standard. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity significantly improved with increasing the filler concentration. Despite the decrease in antimicrobial efficacy after 3 months of aging, modified resin revealed a critical ability to dominate biofilm formation.

A total of 597 restorations (485 in VT, 112 in ETT) with minimum 2.5–3mm remaining cusp thickness, made with the same brand of RBC and adhesive, were evaluated using the USPHS criteria. Data were analyzed with Mann–Whitney, Chi-square and Fisher’s Exact Test, Extended Cox-regression and Kaplan–Meier analysis (p<0.05). Relative risk ratio was estimated for each evaluated parameter. Results The mean observation period was 8.6±2.3 years. An annual failure rate in VT and ETT of 0.08% and 1.78%, respectively, was detected. The reasons of failures included restoration fracture, secondary caries in VT; vertical root fracture, cusp fracture, restoration fracture, secondary caries and loss of adhesion in ETT. Significantly better performance was observed in RBCs of VT for each evaluated parameter. Among the evaluated risk factors only occlusal stress affected negatively the survival of RBC in ETT (Hazard Ratio 37.1; CI95% 8.4–163.7). Significance Although, there is significant difference in the success rate of RBCs in VT (98.97%) and ETT (76.8%), the long-term (6–13 years) durability of Class II RBCs with 2.5–3mm cusp thickness in ETT is also clinically acceptable. The presence of occlusal stress decreases the survival of RBCs in ETT.","Endodontically treated teeth, Class II restoration, USPHS evaluation, Longevity"

Methods Rectangular specimens (10 mm-long, 5 mm-large and 4.2 mm-thick) were prepared and divided into four groups (n = 30/group). The control group (C-Group) consisted of a 4.2 mm-thick layer of monolithic CAD/CAM resin composite resin (Cerasmart, GC). In the 3 other groups including the placement of a fiber layer (F-Groups), the CAD/CAM resin composite layer was reduced to 3-, 2- and 1-mm thickness (F3-, F2- and F1-Groups, respectively). Two bonded layers of bidirectional E-glass FRC (Dentapreg, ADM A.S.) were bonded underneath and a light-curable resin composite base (Gaenial Posterior, GC) was then added to reach a total thickness of 4.2 mm for all samples. In each group, half of the specimens (n = 15) were submitted to quasi-static mechanical loading to failure in a universal testing machine. The other half (n = 15) was subjected to cyclic isometric stepwise loading until failure or completion of 105000 cycles (5000 cycles at 500 N, followed by five stages of 20000 cycles at 750 N, 1000 N, 1250 N, 1500 N, and 1750 N). The data were analyzed by Weibull statistics for quasi-static loading, and by the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimation procedure after fatigue. All fractured specimens were studied using light and electron microscopy techniques, and the types of fracture were determined. Results For quasi-static mechanical loading, significant differences were observed for Weibull modulus and characteristic strength between groups, with values ranging from 10.8 to 22.4 for the former and from 2336.6 to 2974.7 for the latter. Also, survival after stepwise fatigue revealed statistically significant differences between groups (p < 0.05), the lowest values of cycles before failure being observed for F1-Group – Median = 61223 (50415; 65446) – as compared to the other groups – C-Group: Median = 89005 (86189; 98195); F3-Group: Median = 85198 (77279; 87860); F2-Group: Median = 89306 (87454; 97024). Both in quasi-static loading and after fatigue, the observation of fracture modes revealed major differences. While all fractures were vertical (split) in C-Group, the majority of the specimens in F-Groups presented some degree of horizontal deflection of the crack. In all deviated fractures, fractographic analysis confirmed a toughening effect of the fiber layer. Significance The present in vitro work tends to show that the fracture pattern of CAD-CAM resin composites is favorably affected by the presence and position of an underlying bidirectional E-glass fiber layer. The placement of E-glass fibers under a CAD-CAM resin composite may therefore represent an interesting strategy to reduce the risk of catastrophic restoration failure, which could be integrated in the development of the new generation of indirect materials, possibly in 3D-printing approaches.","Fiber-reinforced composite, CAD-CAM, Multi-layered composite restoration, Fractography"

To overcome this drawback, self-healing resin-based composites have been designed by incorporation of microcapsules. However, the relationship between their self-healing capacity and microcapsule and resin parameters is still poorly understood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to systematically investigate the effect of initiator concentration (in the resin) and microcapsule size and concentration on the self-healing performance of commercially available flowable resin-based composites. Methods Poly(urea-formaldehyde) (PUF) microcapsules containing acrylic healing liquid were synthesized in small (33±8μm), medium (68±21μm) and large sizes (198±43μm) and characterized. Subsequently, these microcapsules were incorporated into a conventional flowable resin-based composite (Majesty Flow ES2, Kuraray) at different contents (5–15wt%) and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) initiator concentrations (0.5–2.0wt%). Fracture toughness (KIC) of test specimens was tested using a single edge V-notched beam method. Immediately after complete fracture (KIC-initial), the two fractured parts were held together for 72h to allow for healing. Subsequently, fracture toughness of the healed resin-based composites (KIC-healed) was tested as well. Results The fracture toughness of healed dental composites significantly increased with increasing microcapsule size and concentration (2wt% BPO, p<0.05). The highest self-healing efficiencies (up to 76%) were obtained with microcapsules sized 198±43 um. Significance commercially available resin-based composites can be rendered self-healing most efficiently by incorporation of large microcapsules (198±43μm). However, long-term tests on fatigue and wear behavior are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy.","Microcapsule, Fracture toughness, Self-healing, Resin-based composites, Flowable composite"

Methods Fluorescent europium-doped hydroxyapatite nanowires (HANW:Eu) were synthesized via the hydrothermal method. The HANW:Eu was mixed into Bis-GMA/TEGDMA (60/40, w/w) at different contents (1–5wt.%), and different processing methods (kneading, grinding, stirring) were tested to achieve good dispersion of HANW:Eu with the aid of fluorescent imaging system. Then, the mixtures of HANW:Eu and barium glass powder (BaGP) were kneaded into resin at a fixed content (70wt.%) while at different mixing ratios. In addition to the 3D fluorescent imaging, characterizations were carried out on mechanical properties, fractured surface, wear resistance and polymerization shrinkage, to correlate the composite properties of with the dispersion status of the incorporated HANW:Eu. Results By doping calcium with 5mol.% of europium, the obtained HANW:Eu displayed strong fluorescence, which made the illustration of its in-situ dispersion status within composites being possible. And this helped to judge that kneading was more efficient to homogeneously disperse HANW:Eu than grinding and stirring. However, it was illustrated vividly that HANW:Eu aggregated severely when it was co-incorporated with BaGP into composites at the total content of 70wt.%, which had not been previously revealed by other microscope observations. In comparison with composites containing 70wt.% of BaGP, improvements in the mechanical properties of resulting composites were identified for the cases containing 3wt.% of HANW and 67wt.% of BaGP, however, their wear volume loss and the polymerization shrinkage did not decrease as expected due to the HANW aggregations. Significance The fluorescent filler prepared in this study provides a feasible strategy to illustrate the in-situ dispersion status of inorganic fillers, which provides guidance for the processing of composite resins.","Hydroxyapatite nanowires, Fluorescent, Composite resin, 3D imaging"

The objective of this study was to quantify the long-term elution of various compounds from resin-based dental composites during one year. Methods Eight materials were investigated: G-aenial Anterior, G-aenial Posterior, Venus, Venus Pearl, Venus Diamond, Ceram X mono, Dyract and Filtek Supreme XTE. Cylindrical specimens (6 mm diameter, 2 mm thickness) were immersed in 1mL of three different extraction solutions (water, artificial saliva or ethanol) and stored in the dark at 37°C. Every week, the extraction solution was refreshed. The samples were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results BisEMA3, BisEMA6, BisEMA10, BisGMA, CQ, HEMA, TCD-DI-HEA, TEGDMA, and UDMA were quantified in the samples. Depending on the composite and the extraction solution, certain monomers (BisGMA, HEMA and UDMA) were able to continuously elute from the materials, up until 52 weeks after initial immersion. Monomer elution was clearly higher when ethanol was used as extraction solution. It could be demonstrated that the tested composites continued to release small quantities of monomers over longer periods when a continuous refreshing protocol is followed. Significance Even if monomer elution may not lead to a risk at short term, the potential long-term toxicity should be further investigated. Long-term elution and subsequent chronic exposure to monomers from resin-based dental materials should not be neglected when assessing the overall human health risks.","Artificial saliva, Dental materials, Ethanol, , Liquid chromatography, Mass spectrometry, Monomers"

Methods Class I cavities (4mm depth×5mm diameter) were prepared in 48 extracted third molars and divided in 6 groups. Restorations were completed with a single increment, according to the following groups: (1) Filtek Z250XT (room temperature – activated for 20s); (2) Filtek Z250XT (at room temperature – activated for 40s); (3) Filtek Z250XT (pre-heated at 68°C – activated for 20s); (4) Filtek Z250XT (pre-heated at 68°C – activated for 40s); (5) Filtek BulkFill (at room temperature – activated for 20s); (6) Filtek Z250XT (modified by the addition of a thio-urethane oligomer at room temperature – activated for 40s). Acoustic emission test was used as a real-time polymerization stress (PS) assessment. The intra-pulpal temperature change was recorded with a thermocouple and bottom/top degree of conversion (DC) measured by Raman spectroscopy. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA/Tukey's test (α=5%). Results Pre-heating the resin composite did not influence the intra-pulpal temperature (p=0.077). The thio-urethane-containing composite exhibited significantly less PS, due to a lower number of acoustic events. Groups with pre-heated composites did not result in significantly different PS. Filtek BulkFill and the thio-urethane experimental composite presented significantly higher DC. Significance Resin composite pre-heating was not able to reduce polymerization stress in direct restorations. However, thio-urethane addition to a resin composite could reduce the polymerization stress while improving the DC.","Dental restoration, Polymerization stress, Pre-heating, Composite resins, Thio-urethane additives"

Methods Cavities were prepared on enamel or dentin blocks and treated by BeautiBond Universal (Shofu) and filled by resin-composites containing S-PRG filler (Shofu) at 0 wt% (P0, control), 10 wt% (P10), 30 wt% (P30), 50 wt% (P50) or 70 wt% (P70). The specimens were demineralized by Streptococcus mutans biofilms for 12 days. Wall lesion depth (WL-depth) and outer lesion depth (OL-depth) were measured from fluorescence microscopy. Interfacial bacterial penetration area (BPA) was evaluated from confocal laser scanning microscopy. Wall lesion hardness (WL-hardness) and outer lesion hardness (OL-hardness) were measured with a Vickers microhardness tester. Elemental analysis of resins and surrounding lesions was conducted by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. Results Resin-composites in P70 contained significantly more F, Na and Al than that in P0 and P10. P70, P50 and P30 showed significantly lower WL-depth than P0. P70 showed significantly lower OL-depth, fewer Ca and P loss in lesions than P0. P70 showed significantly higher WL-hardness and OL-hardness in dentin specimens than P0. Enamel margins had a higher gap frequency than dentin margins. However, BPA did not show significant differences among the groups. Significance Resin-composites containing S-PRG fillers at ≥30 wt% can inhibit wall lesions and that at 70 wt% can further decrease outer lesions, reduce Ca and P loss in lesions and increase surrounding dentin hardness.

Methods Five specimens of Filtek Supreme Ultra, Herculite Ultra, Mosaic Ultra, Tetric EvoCeram, TPH Spectra HV, and Venus Pearl were packed into opaque molds that were 2.3mm in diameter and 2.5mm deep. The uncured RBC specimens were covered by a polyester strip and photo-cured with an Elipar DeepCure-S light-curing unit (LCU) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After irradiation, the polyester strip was removed, and the Vickers microhardness was measured immediately at top and bottom surfaces. The hardness measurements were repeated after 30min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 24h, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. In between, the specimens were stored in dry and dark conditions at 37°C. Two-way ANOVA (α=0.05) followed by Tukey–Kramer post hoc multiple comparison tests were used to determine where statistically significant differences existed. Results The micro-hardness values at the top surface always exceeded those at the bottom surface. A significant logarithmic increase of the micro-hardness due to post-irradiation curing took place between 30min and 24h (p<0.05). There was no significant increase in the VH after 24h. Depending on the RBC, compared to the immediate values the hardness 24h post-irradiation had increased by 11–27% at the top surface and by 21–58% at the bottom. Significance Even after 12 weeks, the bottom hardness values never reached the top microhardness values. The results of studies that wait 24h or longer before measuring the properties of RBC specimens will be significantly enhanced by the impact of post-irradiation curing. Especially within the first 4h, the time when specimens are measured is critical information and should be reported.","Resin-based composites, Vickers hardness, Evaluation of curing, Effect of post-irradiation curing, Time dependency"

The current study aimed to determine the degree of conversion, volumetric shrinkage, polymerization stress and the resultant elastic moduli of materials currently used for adhesive cementation and to determine possible correlations. Methods The study considered (i) regular resin composites (Admira Fusion, Gradia, Grandioso, Palfique, Sirius Z, Viscalor and Z100) at room and pre-warmed (PW) at 69ºC, (ii) flowable composites (Sigma Flow and Grandioso Flow); (iii) solely light-activated cements (AllCem Veneer, Variolink Esthetic and RelyX Veneer); and (iv) one dual-activated resin cement (SpeedCEM).

Bonded-disk and Bioman II instruments were used to access polymerization shrinkage strain and shrinkage stress, respectively, for 60 min at 23 ± 1◦C (n = 3). The elastic modulus was determined by 3-point bending flexural test (n = 6). The results were submitted to analyse s of variance, Tukey’s, and correlation tests. Results For regular composites, the pre-warming did not affect DC, shrinkage and modulus but significantly increased the stress magnitude. Correlation tests indicated a significant relationship only between stress and polymerization shrinkage (r = 0.811343). Significance Regular composites can produce less polymerization stress than resin cements when luting laminate veneers. Polymerization stress was dependent on the shrinkage magnitude, but not on the degree of conversion nor the elastic modulus.","Dental materials, Thermoplastic technique, Veneer cements, Shrinkage, Shrinkage stress"

Direct contact test was performed using Filtek™ Z350XT blended with 0.5; 1 and 2% (wt.) of NPs against Streptococcus mutans to determine the best concentration to the other tests. After that, the modified composite resin was tested against S. mutans 7-day biofilm (CFU/mL). Also, compressive and diametral tensile strength (n=40), degree of conversion (n=25) and surface roughness (n=50) was performed. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey’s test for multiple comparison at 5% significance level. Results The direct contact test demonstrates that by increasing the nanoparticle content, the bacterial growth is significantly reduceed (p<0.05). The inclusion of 2% of TiO2/Ag NPs significantly decreased (p<0.05) the biofilm accumulation of S. mutans on the composite resin surface compared to the control Group.

A flowable resin composite (Opallis Flow) and two resin cements (RelyX Veneer, Variolink Esthetic LC) also were tested. Viscosity (Pa s) was measured at 37 °C and 69 °C (preheating temperature) using a rheometer. Film thickness (μm) was measured before and after application of ultrasound energy. Temperature loss within resin composite following preheating (°C/s) was monitored. Data were statistically analyzed (α = 0.05). Results Viscosity at 69 °C was lower than at 37 °C for all materials except the flowable resin composite. Preheating reduced viscosity between 47% and 92% for the restorative resin composites, which were generally more viscous than the flowable materials. Film thickness varied largely among materials. All preheated resin composites had films thicker than 50 μm without ultrasound energy. Application of ultrasound reduced film thickness between 21% and 49%. Linear and nonlinear regressions did not identify any relationship between filler loading, viscosity, and/or film thickness. All materials showed quick temperature reduction following preheating, showing maximum temperature loss rates after approximately 10 s.

Methods This work pioneers the use of discrete element method (DEM) simulations combined with experiments to study the mechanical behavior and reinforcement mechanism of DRCs with NCs fillers. Results The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of NCs-reinforced DRCs have an improvement of 9.58 % and 15.02 % in comparison with nanoparticles (NPs) and microparticles (MPs), respectively, because of the ability of NCs to deflect cracks and absorb stress through gradual fracturing.

To date, there has been no report on the development of a low-shrinkage-stress and bio-interactive cement. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to develop a novel low-shrinkage-stress resin-based cement containing dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and investigate the mechanical and antibacterial properties for the first time. Methods The monomers urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and triethylene glycol divinylbenzyl ether (TEG-DVBE) were combined and denoted as UV resin.

Methods Light-cured bulk-fill resin composites; Tetric N-ceram Bulk Fill (TNB), SonicFill (SNF), Surefil SDR (SDR), dual-cured bulk-fill resin composite Bulk EZ (BEZ), and light-cured core resin composite Clearfil Photo Core (CPC) were investigated. Swept-source OCT real-time cross-sectional monitoring was obtained during resin composite placement and curing procedure. Gap formation was observed in bonded cylindrical resin composite molds (4-mm depth, 3-mm diameter) and free shrinkage volume was observed at the top and bottom of a tube with similar dimensions (n=10). OCT 3D data were analyzed to calculate sealing floor area percentage (SFA%) and volumetric shrinkage in bonded tube (VS%). Data were analyzed by ANOVA at significance level of 0.05. The bottom-top degree of conversion ratio (DC%-R) through 4-mm depth was measured using the XploRA Plus micro-Raman spectroscopy. Results BEZ showed no gap formation at the cavity floor in any specimens while SNF showed the highest gap formation; the statistical order in terms of SFA% was BEZ (100±0)>TNB (84.97±2.98)>CPC (52.13±8.23)=SDR (45.97±9.21)>SNF (16.23±6.00) (p<0.05). On the other hand, total VS% was statistically ordered as BEZ (3.40±0.14)>SDR (3.22±0.09)>TNB (1.82±0.11)>SNF (1.65±0.04)=CPC (1.56±0.04) (p<0.05). Unlike BEZ, the light-cured resin composites showed larger shrinkage at specimen bottom than top. TNB showed the lowest DC%-R followed by SNF (p<0.05). Significance Light-cured bulk-fill resin composites showed various degrees of gap formation and shrinkage at 4-mm deep cavity. The dual-cured bulk-filled resin composite showed no decrease of degree of conversion through the depth and the highest cavity adaptation despite its tendency for higher volumetric shrinkage.","Degree of conversion, Polymerization, Composite resins, Dental restoration failure, Optical coherence tomography, Bulk-filled, Self-cured, Shrinkage"

Material and Methods Four resin-based luting agents were tested: traditional dual-activated resin cement (RelyX ARC, ARC), amine-free dual-activated resin cement (RelyX Ultimate, ULT), light-activated resin cement (RelyX Veneer, VEN), and pre-heated restorative resin composite (Filtek Supreme, PHC). Degree of C=C conversion was determined by infrared spectroscopy (n=3) with direct light exposure or with interposition of 1.5-mm-thick ceramic (e.max Press HT) between the luting material and light. The curing potential considered the ratio between these two scenarios. Color difference (n=6) was determined by CIELAB (ΔEab) and CIEDE2000 (ΔE00) methods, by spectrophotometer measurements made 24h after photoactivation and 90 days after storage in water. Data was submitted to ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α=0.05). Results The luting agents affected both conversion and color stability. With ceramic, ARC produced the highest conversion among the tested groups (75±1%) and the pre-heated composite (PHC) the lowest one (51±3%), but the curing potential was similar for all materials. ULT produced lower ΔEab than ARC. PHC presented the lowest color difference when considered both CIELAB and CIE2000 methods (ΔEab 2.1±0.4; ΔE00 1.6±0.2). Significance All luting strategies presented high curing potential. Amine-free dual-activated material was able to reduce color difference than that formulated with the amine component.

Methods An electronic search was carried out using the following databases: MedLine (PubMed), Embase, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. All titles and abstracts of the articles and patents found were analysed and selected according to the eligibility criteria. Only studies published in English were included; the outcomes sought for this review were dental resin composites with self-healing potential. There were no restrictions on the type of self-healing system involved in dental resin composites. Results The search yielded 10 studies and 2 patents involving self-healing approaches to dental resin composites. According to the current literature on self-healing dental resin composites, when a crack or damage occurs to the composite, microcapsules rupture, releasing the healing agent to repair the crack with a self-healing performance ranging from 25% to 80% of the virgin fracture toughness. Significance Self-healing strategies used with resin composite materials have, to date, been bioinspired. So far, self-healing microcapsule systems within dental composites include poly urea-formaldehyde (PUF) or silica microcapsules. The main healing agents used in PUF microcapsules are DCPD monomer and TEGDMA-DHEPT, with other agents also explored. Silica microcapsules use water/polyacid as a healing agent. All self-healing systems have shown promising results for self-repair and crack inhibition, suggesting a prolonged life of dental composite restorations. More investigations and mechanical enhancements should be directed toward self-healing technologies in dental resin composites.","Self-healing, Self-sealing, Microcapsules, Resin composites, Dental composites"

Data Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) investigating direct and indirect resin composite restorations in posterior permanent teeth were considered. Sources Several electronic databases were searched, with no language or date restrictions. The revised Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB-2) was used to analyze the studies; meta-analyses were run and the certainty of evidence was assessed by the GRADE tool. A subgroup meta-analysis was performed for resin composite restorations placed on posterior worn dentition. Study selection Twenty-three articles were included in qualitative synthesis, while 8 studies were used for meta-analyses. According to the RoB-2 tool, 5 studies were ranked as “low risk”, 7 had “some concerns”, while 11 papers were rated as “high risk” of bias. There were no statistically significant differences in short-term (p = 0.27; RR=1.54, 95% CI [0.72, 3.33]), medium-term (p = 0.27; RR=1.87, 95% CI [0.61, 5.72]) and long-term longevity (p = 0.86; RR=0.95, 95% CI [0.57, 1.59]). The choice of restorative technique had no influence on short-term survival of resin composite restorations placed on worn dentition (p = 0.13; RR=0.46, 95% CI [0.17, 1.25]). The certainty of evidence was rated as “very low”. Conclusions Direct and indirect resin composite restorations may show similar clinical longevity in posterior region, regardless of the observation period or substrate (wear-affected and non-affected dentition). The very low quality of evidence suggests that more long-term RCTs are needed to confirm our results.","Longevity, Composite restoration, Systematic review"

For overcoming this problem, a deep study of shrinkage phenomena is necessary. Methods In this study, micro-tomography (μ-CT) is combined with digital volume correlation (DVC) to investigate the effect of several factors on the polymerization strain of dental composites in model cavities: the presence/absence of an adhesive, the use of transparent/blackened cavities, and irradiation times between 1 and 40s. Results The results indicate that the presence of an adhesive at the interface between the cavity and composite does not reduce the total strain but instead limits it to a preferential direction. In addition, regardless of the conditions, the main strain is generated along the axis parallel to the polymerization irradiation (the vertical axis). Finally, the total strain appears to occur in the first 5s of irradiation, with no further evolution observed for longer irradiation times. Significance This work provides new insight into resin-based composite shrinkage and demonstrates the benefit of coupling DVC and μ-CT to better understand the degradation mechanisms of these materials.","Polymerization shrinkage, Adhesion, Micro-tomography, Digital volume correlation, Strain, tests"

Methods Five recently introduced universal resin composites were tested. Twelve specimens per material were used to measure the stiffness and stickiness (handling properties) of the resin composite pastes. Additionally, surface properties (Knoop hardness number [KHN], surface roughness [Sa], surface gloss [SG], water contact angle [CA], and surface free energy [SFE]) of cured resin composites were determined in 12 specimens per material immediately after preparation (baseline) and after subjection to thermal cycles (TCs). Results Handling and surface properties of the resin composites were material dependent. All the resin composites showed significantly lower KHN in the post-TC subgroups than that in the baseline subgroups. However, the influence of TC on the other surface properties was dependent on the material used. Some resin composites did not indicate any significant differences in Sa, SG, or CA between the baseline and post-TC groups. Significance Although the resin composites in the baseline groups presented with different handling and surface properties, the surface properties of most of the composites were significantly affected by TC. Extremely strong positive or negative correlations were observed between stiffness and stickiness, KHN and Sa, KHN and SG, Sa and SG, and CA and SFE. Most correlations between the handling and surface properties were weak. Therefore, the selection of resin composites in clinical situations should be based on comprehensive consideration of their properties.","Universal resin composite, Handling property, Surface property, Thermal cycle"

Results At the 12-years recall, 59 of the original 68 restorations in 27 of 30 patients were available (drop out 13%). Two restorations failed due to cusp fracture (Tetric Ceram) and marginal fracture (Grandio). The overall success rate of all restorations was 97.1% (Kaplan–Meier survival algorithm) with no differences between the two materials (p=0.923).

Methods Three resin composites (Ceram X, Filtek Supreme XTE and Core-X flow) were used. Samples (5mm×2mm, n=10) were prepared using a metal mold and were polymerized for 20s according to manufacturers’ instructions. A dental unit was disconnected from wastewater circulation and composite samples were ground under standardized procedures (200,000rpm; 90s). Wastewater was collected in glass bottles. Water samples were collected as control by performing the same procedure without grinding resin composite. All samples were stored at 7°C for 6 months to simulate storage. Then they were analyzed by HPLC–FLD. Three filtration materials (Zeosorb, Katalox Light and Catalytic Carbon) were used for water treatment to remove BPA. BPA-water solutions were prepared; corresponding to the highest amount released by the resin composites. These solutions were analyzed before and after filtration by HPLC–FLD and their efficacy (%) was calculated. Results BPA was detected in all composite solutions: Ceram X and Filtek Supreme XTE showed similar findings (p>0.05) which were significantly higher than the control (p<0.001) and Core-X flow (p=0.001). The efficacy of the filtration materials was: Katalox Light (5.09%)<Zeosorb (7.91%)<Catalytic Carbon (99.38%). Only Catalytic Carbon caused a clinically significant reduction of BPA (p<0.05). Significance BPA can be released in wastewater during dental procedures. This release seems to be material dependent.

The tested 3D printed resins were Cosmos Temp3D (COS), SmartPrint BioTemp (SM) Resilab3D Temp (RES) and Prizma3D BioProv (PRI) were evaluated under five different post-curing conditions (no post-curing or 5-, 10-, 15, and 20 min of post-curing). For color change analysis, 10 mm diameter x 1 mm thick discs (n = 7) were printed, and the luminosity, color and translucency were measured before post-curing as control, and repeatedly after 5 min cycles of post-curing until a total of 20 min was reached for ΔE00 [CIED2000 (1:1:1)] calculation. For FS and FM, 25 × 2×2 mm (n = 10, for each post-curing time) 3D printed bars were subjected to a 3-point being test. Knoop microhardness (KHN) was measured transversally on 5 × 5×5 mm blocks (n = 10, for each post-curing time). Color results were analyzed by one-way repeated measures ANOVA (factor: color change). FS and FM were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (factors: Material*Post-Curing Time). KHN was analyzed individually for each material by two-way ANOVA (factors: Depth*Post-Curing Time). Results The post-curing time significantly influenced the ΔE00, FS, FM and KHN of all the evaluated materials. COS and SMA presented ΔE00 values above the acceptability threshold after 5 and 10 min of post-curing, respectively. The FS of RES reached a plateau after 5 min of post-curing, and for PRI and SMA, the FS stabilized after 10 min of post-curing. The post-curing process improved the KHN of the tested materials, and longer exposure periods were associated to higher KHN values at all the evaluated depths. Significance A fine adjustment of the post-curing time is crucial to produce adequate mechanical properties in 3D-printed restorative resins, while minimizing the color alterations on the restorations. For the evaluated resins, 5–10 min of post-curing will result in adequate mechanical properties, without affecting the acceptability in the color of the material.

Methods Sixty-four sound human molars were distributed into 16 groups according to (1) Dentine surface (sound and eroded dentine); (2) dimethyl sulfoxide application (with or without); (3) Application mode (etch-and-rinse or self-etch) and (4) Storage time (immediate and four years). One mild universal adhesive was used (Scotchbond Universal). The restoration was then performed with a composite resin and the specimens were sectioned into resin-dentine bonded sticks. Resin-dentine bonded sticks were tested (immediately and after four years of water storage) for µTBS (0.5 mm/min) or used to assess NL. Data on μTBS and NL were analyzed using four-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α = 0.05). Results Only the 3-way cross-product interaction ‘substrate vs DMSO vs time’ was statistically significant (p = 0.007).

However, when DMSO was applied, no significant decrease of μTBS or NL values was observed after four years of water storage, regardless of adhesive strategies, or dentine evaluated, when compared to immediate results. Significance Water-based DMSO pre-treatments not only prevent degradation of MDP-containing simplified adhesives but also serve as a potential alternative to improve long-term bonding properties to eroded dentine.

Subsequently, the synthesized nanoparticles were incorporated into the dental resin composite at 1 wt.%, 5 wt.% or 10 wt.% to obtain different experimental groups. The physical properties, including curing depth, double bond conversion rate, water absorption and solubility, the sustained-release effects, and mechanical properties of the modified resin composite were evaluated. The remineralization ability was also measured by SEM. The antibacterial experiment of the modified resin composite with fresh preparation or aging in water for 28 days was carried out by a plate count method. Results The physical and chemical characterizations showed that the synthesized nanoparticles presented a core–shell structure, and their diameter was about 98.5 nm.

Glass ionomer cement (GIC) restorations have been proposed to protect the surrounding dental tissues from demineralization through the release of fluoride and by buffering the acid attack from dental biofilms. In contrast, the lack of buffering by composite resin (CR) restorations has been suggested as a promoting factor for the development of secondary caries. Methods The present study employed transversal microradiography and confocal microscopy based pH ratiometry to quantify mineral loss and map microscale pH gradients inside Streptococcus mutans biofilms grown on compound specimens consisting of enamel, dentin and either GIC or CR. Results Mineral loss in dentin was significantly lower next to GIC than next to CR, but no significant differences in local biofilm pH were observed between the two restorative materials. Significance The cariostatic effect of GIC relies predominantly on the provision of fluoride and not on a direct buffering action. The lack of buffering by CR did not affect local biofilm pH and may therefore be of minor importance for secondary caries development.","Composite resin, Glass ionomer cement, Mineral loss, pH ratiometry, Secondary caries, , Transversal microradiography"

The specific objectives included visual assessment of the temperature maps and quantitative assessment of several temperature/time plots at four different locations. Methods A caries-free lower first molar cavity served as a natural tooth mold. Resin composites were placed without intermediary adhesive. Two URPBF composites (PFill; PFlow) and one pre-heated thermo-viscous bulk-fill composite (Viscalor: VC) were compared to a contemporary bulk-fill composite (One Bulk Fill: OBF). Two LED-LCU devices were used: Bluephase PowerCure (PC) and Elipar S10 (S10), with three light-irradiation protocols (PC-3s, PC-10s and S10-10s). 2D temperature maps over the entire coronal area were recorded for 120 s during and after irradiation using a thermal imaging camera. Changes at four different levels were selected from the data sets: (0, 2 and 4 mm from the cavity top and at 1 mm below the dentin cavity floor). The maximum temperature attained (Tmax), the mean temperature rise (ΔT), the time (s) to reach maximum temperature and the integrated areas (°C s) under the temperature/time (T/t) plots were identified. Data were analysed via three-way ANOVA, One-way ANOVA, independent t-tests and Tukey post-hoc tests (p < 0.05). Results All RBCs showed qualitatively similar temperature-time profiles. PFlow reached Tmax in the shortest time. PC-3s (3000 mW/cm2) generated comparable ΔT to S10-10s, except with PFill, where ΔT was greater. Despite the same irradiance (1200 mW/cm2), Elipar S10 led to higher Tmax and ΔT compared to PC-10s. The highest Tmax and ΔT were observed at the 2 mm level, and the lowest were at 1 mm depth into the underlying dentin. Significance Coronal 2D temperature maps showed rises largely confined within the bulk-fill RBC materials, with maxima at 2 mm rather than 4 mm depth indicating some extent of thermal insulation for the underlying dentin and pulp. RBCs polymerized via different irradiation protocols showed similar temperature changes. With the PC-3s protocol – also with pre-heated VC – minimal temperature rises at 1 mm within dentin suggest their clinical safety when sufficient remaining dentin thickness is present.","Thermal imaging, Thermographic analysis, Bulk-fill resin composite, High-irradiance, URPBF composites, Pre-heating, Thermo-viscous composite"

Methods Modulus of elasticity, Poisson’s ratio, and degree of CC conversion were measured for three restorative composite resins (Z100–microhybrid; Empress Direct–nanohybrid; Estelite Omega–supranano) and one photoactivated resin cement (RelyX Veneer). Viscosity was measured during a heating-cooling curve (25°C–69°C–25°C) and also using isothermal analyses at 25°C and 69°C. Feldspar ceramic disks simulating veneers were bonded with the luting materials. Biaxial flexural strength, characteristic strength, and Weibull modulus were calculated at axial positions (z=0 and z=−t2) of the bilayers. Film thickness was measured and morphology at the bonded interfaces was observed. Data were statistically analyzed (α=0.05). Results A gradual decrease in viscosity was noticed as the rheometer temperature gradually increased. Viscosity differences between the composite resins were large at the beginning of the analysis, but minor at 69°C. At 25°C, the composites were up to 38 times more viscous than the resin cement; at 69°C the difference was 5-fold. CC conversion was similar between all resin-based agents. The resin cement yielded lower film thickness than the composites. All resin-based agents were able to infiltrate the ceramic porosities at the interface and strengthen the ceramic. However, the magnitude of the strengthening effect was higher for the preheated composite resins, particularly at z=−t2. Significance Selection of composite resin impacts its response to preheating and the resulting viscosity, film thickness, and magnitude of ceramic strengthening.","Ceramic veneers, Luting, Resin cement, Rheology, Mechanical testing, Film thickness"

Enzyme-catalyzed degradation compromises the dental restoration-tooth interface, increasing cariogenic bacterial infiltration. In addition to bacterial ingress inhibition, antimicrobial-releasing adhesives may exhibit direct interfacial biodegradation inhibition as an additional benefit. Methods Mini short-rod restoration bonding specimens with total-etch adhesive with/without 10% wt. DSPs were made. Interfacial fracture toughness (FT) was measured as-manufactured or post-incubation in simulated human salivary esterase (SHSE) for up to 6-months. Effect of OCT on SHSE and whole saliva/bacterial enzyme activity was assessed. Release of OCT outside the restoration interface was assessed. Results No deleterious effect of DSPs on initial bonding capacity was observed. Aging specimens in SHSE reduced FT of control but not DSP-adhesive-bonded specimens. OCT inhibited SHSE degradation of adhesive monomer and may inhibit endogenous proteases. OCT inhibited bacterial esterase and collagenase. No endogenous collagen breakdown was detected in the present study. OCT increased human saliva degradative esterase activity below its minimum inhibitory concentration towards S. mutans (MIC), but inhibited degradation above MIC. OCT release outside restoration margins was below detection. Significance DSP-adhesive preserves the restoration bond through a secondary enzyme-inhibitory effect of released OCT, which is virtually confined to the restoration interface microgap. Enzyme activity modulation may produce a positive-to-negative feedback switch, by increasing OCT concentration via biodegradation-triggered release to an effective dose, then subsequently slowing degradation and degradation-triggered release.","Biodegradation, Dental caries, Esterase, Enzyme inhibition, Interfacial fracture toughness"

Methods Nanogels were synthesized from isobornyl methacrylate, ethoxylated bisphenol-A dimethacrylate and isocyanatoethyl methacrylate followed by partial further reaction with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate to provide both isocyanate and methacrylate functionalization. A barium glass filler (˜1 μm particle size) was treated with either γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS), N-methylaminopropyltrimethoxy (MAP) or N-allylaminopropyltrimethoxy (AAP) silanes. The reactive nanogels were then covalently attached to the aminosilane-treated fillers. Surface treatment was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DR-IR). Composites were formulated with 60 wt% of the various functionalized fillers and the materials were evaluated for polymerization kinetics, polymerization stress (PS), volumetric shrinkage, mechanical properties and photorheology. Data were evaluated by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test at 5% significance level. Results Filler surface treatments were confirmed by TGA and DR-IR analyses. Nanogel-functionalized fillers significantly reduced PS up to 20%, while the degree of conversion and elastic modulus were not compromised. Similar storage modulus development during polymerization was observed among materials by photorheology although the rate of polymerization was significantly increased for nanogel-based treatments. A significant decrease in flexural strength was observed for amino functional silane groups; however, there was no statistical difference in strength for the MPS control group compared with the nanogel-modified composites. Significance Filler surface treatment modified with a reactive nanogel enables significant PS reduction, without compromise to degree of conversion or mechanical properties of dental composites.","Composite resin, Fillers, Methacrylates, Isocyanates, Nanogels, Surface treatment, Silanization, Polymerization, Stress, Mechanical properties"

Methods Experimental composite series based on either Bis-EMA or UDMA resin were prepared. Each series contained 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40wt% of BG 45S5. Reinforcing fillers were added up to a total filler load of 70wt%. The degree of conversion was evaluated using Raman spectroscopy, while light transmittance was measured using visible light spectroscopy. The depth of cure was estimated from the degree of conversion data and using the ISO 4049 scraping test. Results Replacement of reinforcing fillers with BG can diminish the degree of conversion, light transmittance, and depth of cure. The effect of BG on the aforementioned properties was highly variable between the experimental series. While in the Bis-EMA series, the degree of conversion was significantly impaired by BG, all of the composites in the UDMA series attained clinically acceptable degree of conversion values. The reduction of the degree of conversion in the Bis-EMA series occurred independently of the changes in light transmittance. The UDMA series showed better light transmittance and consequently higher depth of cure than the Bis-EMA series. The depth of cure for all composites in the UDMA series was above 2mm. Significance While the Bis-EMA series demonstrated clinically acceptable curing potential only for 0–10wt% of BG loading, an excellent curing potential in the UDMA series was observed for a wide range (0–40wt%) of BG loadings.","Bioactive glass 45S5, Experimental composites, Bioactive composites, Degree of conversion, Light transmittance, Depth of cure"

Methods The fundamentals of semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) based FRCs and their advantages in forming a solid adhesive interface with indirect FRC restoration, dental adhesive, and luting cement are elaborated. The important resin matrix systems and glass fibers used in FRCs are discussed. This is principally based on a survey of the literature over Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases and a review of the relevant studies and publications in scientific papers in international peer-reviewed journals for the specific topic of biomaterials science. The keywords used for the search approach were: adhesion, fiber-reinforced composite, glass fiber, and semi-interpenetrating polymer network.

Methods A reference maxillary molar with two class II cavities was prepared according to deep margin elevation protocol. A geometrical model was segmented from a micro-CT scan generating separate volumes of enamel, dentin and restorative materials. The 3D Finite Element (FE) model was subsequently built-up and an axial chewing load was simulated. Data concerning the tooth-restoration interface were analyzed in terms of SS and NP. Different materials and techniques were tested in order to evaluate the effects of the restorative material, the usage of a highly-filled flowable composite as liner and the substrate of the cervical area. Results Both SS and NP presented similar distribution, but showed significant differences between tested materials. Composites showed more homogeneous behavior in stress distribution compared to ceramic. The use of a highly-filled flowable composite as liner on the cervical margin significantly reduced SS and NP on the cavity floor and the cervical margin area. Lastly, stress distribution in the cavity floor area varied according to the cervical margin substrate: enamel showed a protective role in stress distribution.

Methods Within one private practice 513 MRC-FPD were directly applied. The preparation of a proximal cavity in abutment teeth was not limited. MRC-FPD were reinforced by one to three metal-wires. At the last follow-up MRC-FPD were considered successful, if they were still in function without any need of therapy. MRC-FPD were considered as survived, if they were repaired or replaced. Multi-level Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between clinical factors and time. Results Mean follow-up period (range) was 59(2−249) months. Seventy-three bridges did not survive (cumulative survival rate(CSR):86%) and further 129 bridges had received a restorative follow-up treatment (CSR:61%). AFR was 2.2% for survival and 8.6% for success. In multivariate analysis MRC-FPD with> 1 wire showed a up to 2.3x higher failure rate than MRC-FPD with one wire(p ≤ 0.023). Dentist’s experience in designing MRC-FDP (p ≤ 0.017), patient’s caries risk (p ≤ 0.040) and bruxism (p = 0.033) significantly influenced the failure rate: the more experience, the lower caries risk and bruxism, the lower the failure rate. Significance For directly prepared metal-wire reinforced composite bridges high survival and moderate success rates were observed. MRC-FPD might, thus, be an immediate, short- and medium-term solution for replacing missing teeth. However, several factors on the levels of practice (dentist’s experience in designing MRC-FDP), patient (bruxism, caries risk) and restoration (number of wires) were identified as significant predictors for the failure rate.

Methods Four CAD/CAM materials [two resin composites CeraSmart (CS) and Grandio Blocs (GB); a polymer infiltrated ceramic Vita Enamic (VE) and a feldspathic ceramic Vita Mark II (VM)], with five thicknesses (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm) were prepared and their optical characteristics measured. 1 mm discs of LC and DC resin cement (Variolink® Esthetic, Ivoclar AG) were photoactivated through each specimen thickness. After 1 h post-cure, polymerisation efficiency was determined by degree of conversion (DC%) and Martens hardness (HM). Interactions between materials, thicknesses and properties were analysed by linear regressions, two-way ANOVA and one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc multiple comparisons (α = 0.05). Results All substrates of 0.5- and 1.0-mm thickness transmitted sufficiently high peak irradiances at around 455 nm: (It = 588–819 mW/cm2) with translucency parameter TP = 21.14 – 10.7; ranked: CS> GB = VM> VE. However, increasing the substrate thickness (1.5–2.5 mm) reduced energy delivery to the luting cements (4 – 2.8 J/cm2). Consequently, as their thicknesses increased beyond 1.5 mm, HM of the cement discs differed significantly between the substrates. But there were only slight reduction of DC% in LC cements and DC cement discs were not affected. Significance: Photoactivating light-cured Ivocerin™ containing cement through feldspathic ceramics and polymer-infiltrated ceramics achieved greater early hardness results than dual-cured type, irrespective of substrate thickness (0.5 – 2.5 mm). However, only 0.5 and 1 mm-thick resin composites showed similar outcome (LC>DC). Therefore, for cases requiring early hardness development, appropriate cement selection for each substrate material is recommended.","CAD/CAM, Resin cements, Optical properties, Translucency, Irradiance, Radiant exposure, FTIR, Degree of conversion, Martens hardness"

Therefore, using in vitro chemical and saliva degradation this study aimed to identify the degradation products of organic compounds present in resin-based dental materials. Methods Ten dental monomers and nine polymerized dental resin-based materials were immersed for 24 h in chemical media (0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M NaOH) and human pooled saliva in order to identify leached monomers and degradation products from chemical and saliva degradation. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify previously unknown degradation products. Results During in vitro chemical degradation, uncured monomers were rapidly hydrolyzed into mono- and demethacrylated degradation products. During chemical degradation in alkaline conditions of polymerized materials, considered the worst-case scenario, only degradation products could be detected. In acidic conditions, monomers and their degradation products were detected. In addition, different additives such as EDMAB, DMPA and HMBP were present in acidic degradation samples. Degradation in human pooled saliva for 24 h to mimic the in vivo situation, resulted in the identification of both monomers and their degradation products. Clinical Significance Using state-of-the-art high-resolution mass spectrometry previously unknown degradation products of commonly used monomers were identified for the first time. Results show that patients may be exposed to monomers and their degradation products in the first 24 h after restorative procedures.

The composite materials were (i) CAD/CAM LAVA Ultimate (N = 1), (ii) Premise Indirect (N = 2), and (iii) Colombus (N = 2). Fractography was performed by means of digital microscopy and SEM. Occlusal surfaces were checked for signs of fatigue degradation and contact wear. Cuspal plane angles were measured from profiles obtained from 3D digital microscope images with respect to the horizontal plane of the occlusal central crown groove. Results All five cases showed a wedge-opening mode I fracture, splitting the crown and tooth in two parts through the crown’s central groove.

Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for articles reporting data from primary longitudinal clinical studies on composite longevity published 2011–2021. Prospective or retrospective studies with restorations in permanent dentition, with follow-up periods of at least 5 years were included. Results In total, 33 articles were included with different study designs, practice settings, datasets, countries of origin, and sample sizes. Annual failure rates of restorations ranged from 0.08% to 6.3%. Survival rates varied between 23% and 97.7%, success rates varied between 43.4% and 98.7%. Secondary caries, fractures, and esthetic compromise were main reasons for failures. Risk factors for reduced restoration durability included patient-level factors (e.g., caries risk, parafunctional habits, number of check-ups per year, socioeconomic status), dentist factors (different operators, operator’s experience), and tooth/restoration factors (endodontic treatment, type of tooth, number of restored surfaces). Patient gender and the composite used generally did not influence durability. Significance A number of risk factors are involved in the longevity of composite restorations. Differences between composites play a minor role in durability, assuming that materials and techniques are properly applied by dentists. Patient factors play a major role in longevity. The decision-making process implemented by dentists relative to the diagnosis of aging or failed restorations may also affect the longevity of restorations.

TSA revealed high power of both meta-analyses. Moderate risk of bias was reported in 23/24 studies; only 1 study showed high risk of bias. GRADE system showed moderate strength of evidence due to the presence of a study with high risk of bias and to wide confidence intervals. Significance Within the limitation of the present systematic review and meta-analysis, it can be concluded that endodontically-treated maxillary premolars restored with a fiber post and direct composite restoration demonstrated increased fracture resistance when compared to equivalent teeth without post.","Direct composite restoration, Endodontically-treated teeth, Fiber post, Fracture resistance, Maxillary premolars, Metal post"

The aims of this study was to investigate the flexural strengths and the reliability of resin-composite blocks for CAD/CAM by uniaxial and biaxial flexure tests and to compare the elastic properties measured by different methods including digital image correlation (DIC). Methods Four resin-composite blocks for CAD/CAM, namely, VE (Vita Enamic), LU (Lava Ultimate), MD (Mazic Duro), and CS (Cerasmart), were investigated. Beam specimens (4.0×1.4×18.0mm3) and disks (12–14mmϕ×1.5mm) were prepared to determine the uniaxial (three-point bending) and biaxial (ball-on-ring, BOR) flexural strengths and flexural moduli. A compression test (8×4×18mm3) with DIC analysis was utilized to measure the elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Data were analysed by a 2-parameter Weibull function and ANOVA with Scheffe’s test. Results The mean uniaxial and biaxial strengths and Weibull moduli of the specimen groups were as follows: uniaxial VE (140.1±7.0, 24.1), LU (159.1±6.3, 31.5), MD (144.9±13.3, 13.6), and CS (165.4±16.9, 11.2) and biaxial VE (153.6±10.4, 19.0), LU (231.0±29.3, 9.7), MD (148.9±23.8, 7.4), and CS (249.7±22.4, 13.8). Although the ranking of both sets of strength data remained unchanged, the strength reliability was significantly affected by the loading; the Weibull moduli of the specimens decreased when they were subjected to biaxial tests (except for that of CS). The elastic modulus values of the materials varied significantly under the different test loadings, although they were in the same order regardless of the test method: VE>>LU≈MD>CS. The DIC technique yielded elastic moduli that were in good agreement with those measured by the uniaxial flexure test. Significance The flexural strength, reliability, and elastic modulus of resin-composite block materials differed with the uniaxial and biaxial flexural loading and the test method. The different behaviours under both loadings should be considered in the evaluation of the mechanical performance of those materials.","Uniaxial flexure strength, Biaxial flexure strength, Elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, Resin-composite blocks, CAD/CAM, Digital image correlation"

New materials have to resist in a demanding environment that includes secondary caries occurrence. The current study hypothesized that the microbiological behavior of different RBCs for CAD/CAM applications is better than that of their counterparts for direct restorations due to differences in the surface characteristics. Methods Both direct and CAD/CAM RBCs were tested. Specimens were obtained from each group, polished, cleaned, stored in artificial saliva (1w), then sterilized under UV (24h). Specimens’ surface was assessed using profilometry, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction; resin/filler content was assessed using thermogravimetry. After pre-incubation with sterile human saliva (24h), the microbiological behavior of the materials was assessed using four models: Streptococcus mutans adherence (2h), S. mutans biofilm formation in an orbital shaking bioreactor (24h), S. mutans biofilm formation in a continuous-flow bioreactor simulating shear forces (24h), and mixed-plaque formation in the bioreactor (24h). The viable biomass adhering to the specimens’ surfaces was measured using a tetrazolium dye-based test. Statistical analysis included verification of normality of distribution and homoscedasticity, then Oneway ANOVA and Tukey's test (α=5%). Results When using the bioreactor setup, CAD/CAM RBCs generally yielded lower S. mutans and mixed-plaque biofilm formation compared to direct RBCs. This difference was not evidenced in the first two microbiological models. Differences in manufacturing and curing processes rather than in materials’ surface roughness and composition could explain these results. Significance CAD/CAM RBCs are promising materials from a microbiological point of view, featuring reduced biofilm formation on their surfaces when shear conditions similar to in vivo ones are present.","CAD/CAM, Resin-based composites, Surface characterization, Biofilm formation, Bioreactors"

Although C-factor has been widely researched, its correlation with stress analysis in dental restorations remains controversial. This review aims to discuss the application and limitations of C-factor and define the restricted conditions under which the C-factor “rule of thumb” is applicable. Methods A thorough literature review was conducted on the application and limitations of C-factor in stress analysis of dental restorations. This was principally based on MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases and a review of the relevant studies and publications in scientific papers in international peer-reviewed journals for the specific topic of C-factor and polymerization shrinkage. Results The C-factor alone cannot provide an accurate prediction of the shrinkage stress of restorations and the mechanical behavior of material-tooth interfaces. C-factor is only applicable under one condition not typically seen in clinical practice: low, near-rigid compliance. Significance Conditions for the application of C-factor have been explicitly defined. A more accurate and precise understanding and utilization of the C-factor is of benefit as it contributes to better understanding of polymerization shrinkage behavior of restorations.","Dental restorations, Resin composites, Polymerization shrinkage, C-factor, Stress analysis"

Methods Silica nanoparticles with sizes compatible to ALSI (Aerosil 150) and ZRSI (Aerosil OX 50) were tested as references. The volume of nanoparticles was equivalent across the composites, which also had consistent content of glass microparticles. CC conversion, viscosity, depth of cure, surface topography, hardness, opacity, radio-opacity, and edge chipping resistance (ReA) were tested after 24 h. Flexural strength (σf) and fracture toughness (KIC) were also tested after 15 K thermal cycles. Data were analyzed using one-way or two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α = 0.05). Results ALSI and ZRSI yielded resin composites with lower viscosity and more irregular nanoagglomerates compared to nanosilica-based composites. CC conversion and depth of cure were lower for ZRSI composite, which had higher opacity, radio-opacity, and hardness. ReA was higher for ALSI composite. Composites with ALSI and ZRSI showed stable σf after aging, whereas the control and Aerosil 150 resin composites showed significant degradation. The commercial and nanosilica-based composites showed up to 42% reduction in KIC after aging, whereas resin composites with ZRSI and ALSI showed a more stable KIC. Significance ALSI and ZRSI generated nanohybrid resin composites with improved and/or more stable physical properties compared with nanosilica-based and commercial composites.

Methods The continued failure of newly introduced RBRs to address biostability without compromising function, over the last decade, are presented as a rationale to support different resin-based concepts. Several developments in the field, aimed at addressing the issues facing modern resin-based systems are summarized and their limitations discussed. A design workflow is proposed for evaluating new RBR, considering resource needs. Results While several alternative resin chemistries have been suggested over the past decade, all have shown serious limitations in replacing MA-based materials, including their limited physical and mechanical properties, and curing kinetics. Additionally, a broad and inconsistent range of laboratory methods have been used to validate these developments, leading to results that are difficult to compare across studies. A design workflow was conceptualized to facilitate the screening of novel RBRs from both a clinical and research perspective. Significance While several alternative chemistries have shown some degree of potential in emulating material property aspects of MA-based resins, a complete restorative system that is resistant to biochemical reactions in saliva has yet to achieve broad clinical adoption. To further spur development, it would be useful to have a more systematic design workflow, that may be used to easily screen new resin technologies effectively early in the design phase, so as to mitigate potential performance failures in the clinic.","Resin-based restoratives, Biostability, Restorative failure, Resin design, Methacrylates"

Meanwhile, many new clinical trials on resin composites had been published. New materials such as bulk fill resin composites and new glass-ionomer (GIC) based materials had been introduced. The focus of this review was to evaluate the longevity in relation to the material class and adhesive class, while adjusting for a possible study bias effect. Material and methods The database PUBMED/SCOPUS were searched for clinical trials on posterior resin composites. The inclusion criteria were: (1) studies published between 2000 and 2019, (2) prospective clinical trial with at least 2 years of observation; (2) minimal number of restorations at last recall = 20; (3) report on drop-out rate; (4) report of operative technique and used materials; (5) utilisation of Ryge, modified Ryge or FDI evaluation criteria. The bias of each study was assessed by two independent reviewers using Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. For the statistical analysis, linear mixed models fitted on the individual data recorded along time have been used with random effects to account for study, patients and experiment effects. P-values smaller than 0.05 were considered significant. Results Of the 423 clinical trials, 62 studies (including 110 experiments) met the inclusion criteria. Material class was divided according to the composite filler in microhybrid (39 experiments/2807 restorations), nanohybrid (24 experiments/1254 restorations), and hybrid (22 experiments/1255 restorations). So-called bulk fill materials were treated as a separate category (9 experiments/506 restorations) as were the GIC (11 experiments/2121 restorations) and the compomer materials (5 experiments/238 restorations). Only one study (1.6%) had low risk of bias, 42 (67.7%) were assessed to have unclear risk of bias and 19 (30.6%) had a high risk of bias. In 52.3% of the studies Class II and Class I restorations had been placed. After 10 years, the survival rate for resin composite restorations dropped to about 85–90% with no significant difference between hybrid, microhybrid and nao-hybrid resin materials. The main reasons for restoration replacement were bulk fractures and wear, which accounted for a about 70% of replacements. Caries at the restorative margins accounted for about 20% of the replacements, and retention loss, inacceptable colour match or marginal integrity, endodontic treatment or cusp fracture for about 10% of the replacements of the resin composite restorations. For compomer and GIC restorations the mean overall survival rate was about 80% after 6 years. For GIC, the main reasons for failure were substantial loss of anatomical contour along with loss of proximal contacts and retention loss. Mainly fractures reduced the longevity of compomers restorations. Also, there was no statistically significant difference between hybrid, micro-hybrid, nano-hybrid and bulk fill resin composites with regard to colour match, surface texture, material fractures, and anatomical form. Conclusions: Posterior resin composite restorations that were placed with the enamel etch technique showed the best overall performance; the longevity was not significantly influenced by the filler type or viscosity of resin composite material. With regard to colour match, surface texture and anatomical form, nanohybrid resins were not significantly superior to hybrid or microhybrid resin composites. Compomer and GIC restorations demonstrated considerable shortcomings and had a significant shorter longevity.","Clinical efficacy, Composite resins, Bulk fill, Compomers, Glass ionomers, Longevity, Meta-analysis, Bias"

Methods Between 2001 and 2007, 176 upper premolars in 157 patients were restored with 92 direct and 84 indirect resin composite restorations as part of an RCT. Inclusion criteria were fracture of the buccal or palatal cusp of vital upper premolars along with a class II cavity or restoration in the same tooth. Results Forty patients having 23 direct and 22 indirect composite restorations respectively, were lost to follow-up (25.6%). The cumulative Kaplan-Meier survival rates were 63.6% (mean observation time: 15.3 years, SE 5.6%) with an AFR of 2.4% for direct restorations and 54.5% (mean observation time: 13.9 years, SE: 6.4%) with an AFR of 3.3% for indirect restorations. The Cox regression analysis revealed a statistically significant influence of the patient’s age at placement on the survival of the restoration (HR 1.036, p = 0.024), the variables gender, type of upper premolar, type of restoration, and which cusp involved in the restoration had no statistically significant influence. Direct composite restorations failed predominantly due to tooth fracture, indirect restorations primarily by adhesive failure (p < 0.05). Significance There was no statistically significant difference in survival rates between direct and indirect composite cusp-replacing restorations. Both direct and indirect resin composite cusp-replacing restorations are suitable options to restore compromised premolars. The longer treatment time and higher costs for the indirect restoration argue in favor of the direct technique.","Clinical study, Composite materials, Restorative dentistry, Cusp-replacing, Adhesion, Indirect, Direct, Survival, Success, Clinical performance"

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the fracture strength and failure mode of resilient materials for both crowns and abutments and compare them to the most widely used materials in different combinations after subjection to long-term fatigue loading. Methods Forty-eight cement-retained implant-restorations were assembled on titanium implants. Identical custom-made CAD/CAM abutments were milled out of 3 different materials (n = 16); T: titanium, Z: zirconia and P: ceramic-reinforced PEEK. Each group was subdivided, according to the restorative crown material, into two subgroups (n = 8); C: nano-hybrid composite and L: Lithium disilicate. Specimens were subjected to dynamic load of 98 N for 1,200,000 cycles with integrated thermal cycling. The surviving specimens were subjected to quasi-static loading until failure. Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test for normality. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test was used to detect statistically significant differences between groups. Results All specimens withstood 1,200,000 load cycles. The fracture strength values varied from a minimum of 1639 ± 205 N for group PL to a maximum of 2949 ± 478 N for group ZL. Significance The abutment material influenced the fracture strength and failure mode of the restoration. A combination of zirconia abutments and nano-hybrid composite showed the most favorable mode of failure within the test groups.

Data Randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating indirect adhesively-luted ceramic restorations compared to metal or metal-based cemented restorations in permanent posterior teeth. Sources Three electronic databases (PubMed, CENTRAL (Cochrane) and Embase) were screened. No language or time restrictions were applied. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were done in duplicate. Risk of Bias and level of evidence was graded using Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and Grade Profiler 3.6. Results A total of 3056 articles were found by electronic databases. Finally, four RCTs were selected. Overall, 443 restorations of which 212 were adhesively-luted ceramic restorations and 231 conventionally cemented metal restorations have been placed in 314 patients (age: 22-72 years). The highest annual failure rates were found for ceramic restorations ranging from 2.1% to 5.6%. Lower annual failure rates were found for metal (gold) restorations ranging from 0% to 2.1%.

Conventionally cemented metal restoration showed a significantly lower failure rate than adhesively-luted ceramic ones (visual-tactile assessment: Risk Ratio (RR)[95%CI]=0.31[0.16,0.57], low level of evidence). Furthermore, all studies showed a high risk of bias. Conclusion Conventionally cemented metal restorations revealed significantly lower failure rates compared to adhesively-luted ceramic ones, although the selected sample was small and with medium follow-up periods with high risks of bias.","Ceramics, Gold, Failure, Clinical studies/trials, Meta-analysis, Operative dentistry, Restorative materials, Systemic reviews and evidence-based medicine"

In addition to (co)monomers, the analytical focus was on other potentially toxic ingredients or impurities. Furthermore, the barrier function of the residual dentin/adhesive layer was studied. Methods Six BF-RBC materials were studied. For each material subgroup, ten human third molar teeth with standard Class-I occlusal cavities were prepared and provided with a three-step adhesive system and the respective composite restoration (tooth groups). Same sized control specimens of the restorative material were prepared (‘direct BF-RBC’ groups). Each specimen was placed in an elution chamber such that the elution media (ethanol/water, 3:1) only contacted the tooth root or ¾ height of each specimen. They were incubated at 37 °C for up to 7 d. Samples of eluate were taken after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d and were analysed by high-temperature gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results (Co)monomers such as Bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate (bisEMA) or tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEEGDMA) were mostly found in the eluates of the ‘direct BF-RBC’ groups in statistically significantly greater amounts than in the eluates of the ‘tooth groups’. The residual dentin and/or adhesive layers acted as a diffusion barrier for most of the substances except for triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) or diethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA). For TEGDMA up to 3 orders of magnitude more were found in the ‘tooth groups’ compared to the ‘direct BF-RBC’ groups, evidently released by the adhesive system. Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) including TINUVIN® 328 and BPA were found mainly in the eluates of ‘direct BF-RBC’ groups. Significance For estimation of biocompatibility, a total system, specifically BF-RBC + adhesive, should always be investigated since individual considerations, such as only elution from a BF-RBC, do not correctly reflect the total clinical situation. The focus of elution tests should not only be on the co(monomers), but also on other ingredients or impurities that may be released.","GC/MS, BisEMA, Bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate, Dicyclohexyl phthalate, Drometrizole, Tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, Decan-1,10-diol dimethacrylate, BPA, TINUVIN, 328, Dentin barrier, Dentinal tubules, Elution, Bulk fill"

However, other factors determine the clinical success of a restorative material. Clinically the major reasons for failure of direct restorations are secondary caries and fracture of the restoration or the tooth itself. In the long-term composite resin restorations in posterior teeth may be prone to wear. As bulk-fill materials have their own composition that will determine their mechanical properties, the wear resistance may be affected as well. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the wear of bulk-fill composites in comparison with a conventional hybrid composite. The null hypothesis was that there are no differences between the four bulk-fill materials and one traditional highly filled nanohybrid composite for posterior use when subjected to a two-body wear rate test and hardness measurement. Methods Four bulk-fill composites SDR Smart Dentin Replacement (SDR), X-tra base (XBA), FiltekBulk Fill (FUP), Dual-Curing Bulk Composite (FBFL) and conventional nanohybrid resin composite Grandio (GDO) subjected to a two-body wear test against a stainless steel (SS) antagonist wheel. Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis was performed to detect the surface alterations. Microhardness of all samples was tested (n = 5) with a Vickers diamond indenter (5 indentations in each specimen). One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test (P < 0.01) were used to analyze differences in wear values. The hardness data were submitted to one-way ANOVA test, followed by the Tukey post hoc test (α = 0.05). T-test was applied to compare wear rate in time interval between one day and one month. Results The highest wear rate values were recorded for SDR and the lowest wear rate values were for GDO. Hardness was the highest for GDO and the lowest for FBFL. Significance The bulk-fill composites have a higher wear rate and lower hardness than the conventional nanohybrid composite, making them less suitable for stress-bearing restorations.","Wear, Dental material, Composite resin, Tooth wear, Bulk-fill"

Seven restorations showed unfavorable events and were classified as failure. Four bulk-fill restorations failed due to tooth infracture (n = 1), chipping fractures (n = 2) and recurrent decay (n = 1), whereas three conventional nanohybrid composite restorations failed due to adhesive failure (n = 1), tooth infracture (n = 1) and chipping as well as recurrent decay (n = 1). The mean annual failure rate was 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively. The difference between test and control group was not significant (p = 0.7). Data on the detailed assessment of FDI criteria were available for n = 48 and n = 49 restorations, respectively. No significant differences between the two groups could be found regarding the assessment of esthetic, functional and biological properties. Significance Both materials showed similar clinical performance and survival. The use of bulk-fill composite proved to be an esthetically, functionally and biologically satisfactory alternative in the posterior dentition during the 3-year follow-up.","Dental material, Randomized controlled trial, Bulk-fill, Composite resin, Posterior"

Methods Four resin blends were formulated with methacrylate-based monomers: BisGMA + TEGDMA (control); BisEMA + BisGMA + TEGDMA (BisEMA-based); UDMA + BisGMA + TEGDMA (UDMA-based) and BisEMA + UDMA + BisGMA + TEGDMA (BisEMA + UDMA-based). For each material, a photoinitiating system and silanized filler particles were added. The rheological analyses were performed with a rotational rheometer using the cone/plate geometry. CIELab coordinates were assessed over black and white backgrounds using a bench spectrophotometer (SP60, X-Rite) to calculate the translucency parameter (TP) for samples with 0.5, 4, and 6 mm thickness. The degree of CC conversion (DC) was determined by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR/ATR) at 0.05 mm (top), 4, and 6 mm depths (bottom), and the bottom-to-top ratio was considered. A broad spectrum–based LED was used for light activation. Analysis of variance and Tukey’s test (95%) were performed on the results. Results The materials tested showed pseudoplastic and thixotropic behavior and a predominance of viscous effects over elastics. The control resin yielded the lowest viscosity for the entire shear rate investigated, followed by the BisEMA-based, BisEMA + UDMA-based, and UDMA-based group, which had the highest viscosity. The UDMA-based material showed the lowest TP as a function of thickness. Both the materials’ formulations and depths significantly influenced the DC. The UDMA-based group promoted the highest DC ​​on the top (71 ± 1%) and 4 mm depth (68 ± 1%) but exhibited lower bottom-to-top DC ratio. The BisEMA + UDMA-based material promoted the highest bottom-to-top DC ratio at 4 mm (99%) and 6 mm (97%). Significance The resin matrix interferes in the rheological behavior, translucency parameter, and polymerization capacity as a function of depth. The material formulated with the addition of UDMA and BisEMA demonstrated the highest curing potential as a function of depth and can be useful for bulk-fill applications.","Bulk fill, Resin matrix, Degree of conversion, Spectroscopy, Rheology"

Albeit these materials are placed for several months in intimate contact with dental hard and soft tissues, including the gingival crevice, there exists only insufficient evidence on the biocompatibility of these materials. This in vitro study aimed to delineate the biocompatibility of 3D printable materials on periodontal ligament cells (PDL-hTERTs). Methods Samples of four dental resin materials for additive fabrication of temporary restorations using 3D printing (MFH, Nextdent; GC Temp, GC; Freeprint temp, Detax; 3Delta temp, Deltamed), one material for subtractive fabrication (Grandio disc, Voco) and one conventional temporary material (Luxatemp, DMG) were prepared with a standardized size according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human PDL-hTERTs were exposed to resin specimens or eluates of the material for 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 days. For determination of cell viability, XTT assays were performed. In addition, the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 and 8 (IL-6 and 8) was assessed in the supernatants with ELISA. Cell viability and the expression of IL-6 and 8 in presence of the resin material or their eluates was compared with untreated controls. Immunofluorescence staining for IL-6 and IL-8, as well as scanning electron microscopy of the discs after culturing, were performed. Differences between groups were analyzed with Student´s t-test for unpaired samples. Results Compared to untreated control samples, the exposure against the resin specimen induced strong reduction of cell viability in case of the conventional material Luxatemp (p < 0.001) and the additive material 3Delta temp (p < 0.001) irrespective of the observation period. On the contrary, the presence of eluates of the various materials induced only minor changes in cell viability. Considering IL-6 (day 2: p = 0.001; day 6 and 9: p < 0.001) and IL-8 (day 1: p = 0.001; day 2, 3, 6, 9: p < 0.001) their expression was strongly reduced in presence of the eluate of Luxatemp. Except for IL-6 at day 1 and 6 also the material 3Delta temp caused significant reduction of both proinflammatory mediators at any time point. Significance The conventional material Luxatemp and the additive material 3Delta temp appear to severely affect cell viability when in direct contact with PDL-hTERTs. The other tested materials of this new category of additive materials and the subtractive material Grandio seem to induce only minor changes in direct contact with these cells. Therefore, they could serve as a viable alternative in the fabrication of temporary restorations.","3D printing, CAD/CAM, PDL, Proinflammatory, Resin, Eluates, Provisional material"

The aim of this study was to determine whether such behavior is more generally characteristic of a wider range of RBCs. Methods Eight representative RBCs were selected based on different clinical categories: three bulkfills (OBF, Filtek One Bulk Fill; VBF, Venus Bulkfill; EBF, Estelite Bulkfill), three conventional non-flowables (XTE, Filtek Supreme XTE; GSO, GrandioSo; HRZ, Harmonize) and conventional flowables (XTF, Filtek Supreme XTE Flow; GSF, GrandioSo Flow). Stainless steel split molds were used to fabricate cylindrical specimens (4mm (dia)×4mm). These were irradiated (1.2W/cm2) for 20s on the top surface. Post-irradiation specimens (n=3), within their molds, were centrally loaded with a flat-ended 1.5mm diameter indenter under 14MPa stress: either immediately (<2min) or after 24h delayed indentation. Stress was maintained for 2h, then – after removal – recovery measurements continued for a further 2h. Indentation depth (%) versus time was measured continuously to an accuracy of <0.1μm. Data were analyzed by One-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests (α=0.05). Results Time-dependent viscoelastic indentation was observed for all RBCs. For immediate indentation, the maximum indentation range was 1.43–4.92%, versus 0.70–2.22% for 24h delayed indentation. Following 2h recovery, the residual indentation range was 0.86–3.58% after immediate indentation, reducing to 0.22–1.27% for delayed indentation. The greatest immediate indentation was shown by VBF followed by XTF and GSF. OBF, HRZ, XTE and GSO had significantly lower indentations (greater hardness). XTE showed a significantly reduced indentation maximum compared to OBF (p<0.05). Indentations delayed until 24h post-irradiation were reduced (p<0.05) for most materials. Significance The indentation-creep methodology effectively characterized resin-based composites within several categories. Viscoelastic properties evaluated by the indentation-creep method confirmed that highly filled RBCs were more resistant to indentation. Indentations were reduced after 24h post-irradiation due to further matrix-network development.","Indentation-creep, Bulk fill, Resin-based composites, Photo-polymerization, Creep, Viscoelastic properties"

A systematic review and meta-analysis,Dental Materials,37,11,,e503-e521,2021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0109564121002396,"Objective To answer the following PICOS question: “Is the risk of retention loss, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation and postoperative sensitivity (POS) equal for etch-and-rinse (EAR) compared to self-etch (SE) or selective-enamel etch (SEE) mode when restoring non carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) with universal adhesives?”. Methods PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scientific Electronic Library Online, LILACS, OpenGrey and Google Scholar™ were searched. Randomized controlled clinical trials in which resin composites and universal adhesives were used for restoration of NCCLs were considered. Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed using Revman; random-effects models were applied, and heterogeneity was tested using the I2 index. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Certainty of evidence was assessed by GRADE tool. Results After screening, 20 articles were included in qualitative, while 14 articles were used for quantitative synthesis. Twelve studies ranked as “low”, while 8 studies scored as “unclear” for risk of bias. At 12- and 18/24-months the risk for retention loss was higher for SE than for EAR groups (p = 0.005; RR = 0.22, 95% CI [0.08, 0.63],[moderate certainty of evidence and p = 0.0002; RR = 0.32, 95% CI [0.17, 0.58], moderate certainty of evidence, respectively). No significant differences were observed for marginal discoloration and adaptation (p > 0.05). The probability of POS occurrence was less in SE than in EAR groups (RR = 2.12, 95% CI [1.23, 3.64], moderate certainty of evidence). The certainty of evidence for other outcomes was scored as “low” or “moderate”, depending on the follow-up period. Significance Using universal adhesives in EAR or SEE mode provides more predictable retention, while SE strategy reduces the risk of POS occurrence.","Universal adhesives, Non-carious cervical lesions, Systematic review"
