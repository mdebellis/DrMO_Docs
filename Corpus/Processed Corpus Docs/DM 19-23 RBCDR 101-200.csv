Methods Fifty participants were included. Futurabond U (Voco) was applied in NCCLs using four adhesive strategies (n = 50 each): only self-etch (SE); selective enamel etching + self-etch (SET + SE); etch-and-rinse with dry dentin (ERD); and etch-and-rinse with wet dentin (ERW). All cavities were restored with Admira Fusion composite resin (Voco). Restorations were evaluated after 1, 3, and 5 years using the World Federation criteria (FDI) and the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Results After 5 years, retention rates were 81 % (65.8–90.5) for SE, 87 % (73.2–94.4) for SET + SE, 84 % (69.6–92.6) for ERD, and 78 % (63.6–88.9) for ERW (p > 0.05).

Methods Four test groups were assigned: two groups with occlusal-proximal preparation (PT1 and PT2 for grade 2 and 3 wear), and two groups for occlusal-proximal and lingual preparation (PLT1 and PLT2 for grade 2 and 3 wear) Monolithic zirconia ceramic (3Y-TZP) RBFDPs were luted with an adhesive bonding system (Panavia V5). The specimens underwent a chewing simulation for 1.200.000 cycles with a load of 5 kg and thermocycling for 7500 cycles between 5 °C and 55 °C. The surviving restorations were debonded under quasi-static conditions. The results were analyzed with ANOVA. Results The specimens exhibited a 100 % survival rate after thermomechanical fatigue loading. The debonding resistance was statistically significant higher for group PLT1 than for group PT1 (P = 0.004), and higher for group PT2 than group PT1 (P ≤ 0.001). However, the debonding resistance showed no statistically significant difference between groups PT2 and PLT2 (P = 0.343), and groups PLT1 and PLT2 (P = 0.222). Groups PT1 and PT2 showed favorable failure modes in 62.5 % and 0.00 % of the specimens, respectively. While groups PLT1 and PLT2 presented 25 % favorable failure modes. Significance Occlusal veneers showed promising results as a retainer for cantilever RBFDPs. The lingual extension might increase debonding resistance.

Methods Sub-micron (SM) and micron (M) size capsules containing PACs were produced using a combination of emulsification and solvent evaporation techniques and characterized. Human dentin surfaces (n = 8) were etched (35% glycolic acid) and primed (15% enriched Vitis vinifera extract solution - VVe), followed by the application of an experimental adhesive containing 0 (control), 1.5 wt% of SM or M PAC-filled PLA capsules light cured for 40 s. A crown was built using commercial composite. After 24 h-immersion (37 °C) in simulated body fluid, specimens were serially sectioned into resin-dentin beams. Microtensile bond strength (TBS), micro-permeability and fracture pattern were assessed immediately and after 1 and 2 years. Data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and post-hoc test (α = 0.05). Results Polydisperse capsules were manufactured with average diameter of 0.36 µm and 1.08 µm for SM and M, respectively. The addition of capsules did not affect TBS (p = 0.889). After 2 years, TBS significantly decreased in SM (p = 0.006), whereas M showed similar initial values (p = 0.291). Overall, less micro-permeability was found in M than the control and SM group (p < 0.001). After 2 years, fractured surfaces from capsule-containing groups failed within the adhesive layer while control fractured at the bottom of the hybrid layer. Significance The addition of PAC-filled PLA microcapsules in a dental adhesive did not affect the bond strength while increased and sustained the protection against micro-permeability in the interface, likely due to release of PACs.","Proanthocyanidins, Bond strength, Polylactide capsules, Bioactive release, Sustained release"

Methods For FRC characterization, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transformed infrared spectrometry, simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were performed. For fatigue testing, 3-unit FRC frameworks were fabricated with conventional (9 mm2 connector area) and modified designs (12 mm2 connector area and 2.5 mm-height lingual extension). A hybrid resin composite was veneered onto the frameworks. FDPs were subjected to step-stress accelerated-life fatigue testing until fracture or suspension. Use level probability Weibull curves at 300 N were plotted and the reliability for 100,000 cycles at 300, 600 and 800 N was calculated. Fractographic analysis was performed by stereomicroscope and SEM. Results The FRC consisted of an epoxy resin (∼25%) matrix reinforced with inorganic particles and glass fibers (∼75%). Multi-layer continuous regular-geometry fibers were densely arranged in a parallel and bidirectional fashion in the resin matrix. Fatigue analysis demonstrated high probability of survival (99%) for FDPs at 300 N, irrespective of framework design. Conventional FDPs showed a progressive decrease in the reliability at 600 (84%) and 800 N (19%), whereas modified FDPs reliability significantly reduced only at 800 N (75%). The chief failure modes for FRC FDPs were cohesive fracture of the veneering composite on lower loads and adhesive fracture of the veneering composite at higher loads. Significance Milled epoxy resin matrix reinforced with glass fibers composite resulted in high probability of survival in the implant-supported prosthesis scenario.","Dental materials, Dental prosthesis, Dental implants"

Methods An aromatic amine and benzoyl peroxide redox initiator system was partitioned between BAPO-photoinitiated BisGMA/HEMA adhesive and BisGMA/TEGDMA resin-composites. The composite was placed on the photocured adhesive layer with a brief delay before photopolymerization of the composite layer. Micro-tensile bond strength between the adhesive and composite was assessed in comparison with the non-redox active control materials. Results The presence of amine or peroxide in these resins without the redox initiation contribution enhanced both the rate and the final conversion of the BAPO-based photopolymerizations. Control formulations using redox-only initiation showed active polymer formation starting at approximately 30 s when physical mixing of the redox components was involved; however, simply by waiting 60 s between composite placement and photocure provided adequate time for passive interfacial diffusion of benzoyl peroxide from the pre-cured adhesive into the overlaid aromatic amine-containing composite such that a sufficient degree of redox initiated interfacial polymerization occurred prior to the composite photocure. The result was a significant increase in the adhesive to composite micro-tensile bond strength with the failure site moved away from the mainly interfacial failure noted for the control. Significance The stress-free autonomous pre-conversion of a redox-initiated thin film of composite that then provides a compositionally homogeneous interface for composite photopolymerization offers a means to enhance at least short-term bond strength between the adhesive and composite phases during restorative placement.","Dental materials, Composite restorative resin, Adhesives, Dentin bonding, Amine-peroxide redox polymerization, Interfacial polymerization"

Methods The Exothane 24 was characterized using mass spectroscopy, elemental analysis, 13C- and 1H NMR. BFCs were formulated containing Exothane 24 (E10, E25, and E50). Similar BFCs containing regular UDMA (U10, U25, and U50), commercial conventional, and BFCs were used as control groups. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used to measure DC and the Rp of the composites. The PSS was measured using the universal testing machine method. Specimen bars were used to assess the FStrenght, FModulus, and VHardness. RBCs were submitted to a two-body wear test using a chewing simulator machine; the rate and volumetric wear loss were evaluated using an optical scanner. Data were analyzed statistically with α = 0.05 and β = 0.2. Results Exothane 24 is a urethane isophorone tetramethyl methacrylate monomer with polymerization stress-relieving properties. No differences were found in the DC up to 4 mm in depth for E25. All BFCs had similar FStrenght, except for E50. E25 had the lowest volumetric wear loss and wear rate. E25 had approximately 30% lower PSS and slower Rp than commercial BFCs with similar wear resistance to conventional commercial composites.

Methods Eight dual-cure resin-cements were investigated (Bifix SE, Nexus Third Generation, PANAVIA SA, PANAVIA V5, RelyX Ultimate Universal, RelyX Unicem 2, RelyX Universal and SpeedCEM Plus). Six disk-shaped specimens were made per curing mode: light-cure (LC) versus self-cure (SC) to measure amounts of eluted monomers after 30 d of water storage at 37 °C. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC MS/MS) was performed to identify and quantify three eluted monomers (Bis-GMA, UDMA and TEGDMA). Water sorption/ solubility specimens were prepared according to ISO 4049. Specimens from each curing mode (LC/SC) were immersed separately in distilled water for 30 d and then reconditioned for 30 d; all at 37 °C. Mass change was measured at different time intervals. Data were analyzed via one-way ANOVA, Tukey post-hoc tests and independent sample t-tests (α = 0.05). Results After 30 d of water storage, the three monomers Bis-GMA, UDMA and TEGDMA were detected in water. All monomers showed a variable extent of elution into water and were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) with SC compared to LC curing modes. BSE had the highest quantity of eluted monomers. After 30 d of water sorption (μg/mm3), all rein-cements showed significantly higher sorption (p < 0.05) of SC compared to LC curing modes except for PV5, RXU and CEM (p > 0.05). After 30 d of water solubility (μg/mm3), all resin-cements showed significantly higher solubility (p < 0.0001) of SC compared to LC curing mode. BSE had the highest water sorption and solubility. The total amounts of eluted monomers correlated positively with solubility: r2 = 0.95 for LC and r2 = 0.93 for SC. Significance Whenever light access is possible, light curing remains beneficial to reduce the extent of resin degradation and related properties of dual-cure resin cements.

Methods Model composites were formulated with dimethacrylate-based monomers, a photoinitiator/co-initiator system and silicon dioxide nano-sized fillers treated with different amounts of 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTS): 1.0 (G1%), 2.0 (G2%), 5.0 (G5%), 7.5 (G7.5%) and 10 (G10%) wt.% relative to SiO2. Non-silanized fillers (G0%) were used in the control group. Degree of conversion (DC) was assessed by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Knoop hardness (KHN) and elastic modulus were determined before and after water storage for 4 months. Water sorption (Wsp) and solubility (Wsl) were calculated by successive mass determinations in analytical balance. Surface gloss and roughness were characterized before and after toothbrushing simulation. Results With the exception of those fillers treated with 1% MPTS, DC was not dependent on the silane content. Within the silanized groups, G1% showed the lowest initial and final KHN, without statistical difference from G0%. The elastic modulus was not affected by the silane content, regardless of the storage condition, but those groups formulated with at least 5% silane presented improved values after storage. Silane content did not affect the WSl, but affected Wsp, in which those groups formulated with at least 2 wt.% of MPTS produced a more resistant material than G0%. The use of treated particles with at least 2 wt.% of silane was able to produce materials that did not change their gloss after the brushing process. Additionally, these materials presented lower surface roughness than G0% after the brushing process (p < 0.05). Significance The concentration of MPTS affected the physicochemical properties of nano-filled composites. Therefore, 2 wt.% of silane was the optimized quantity to produce materials resistant to degradation, both in bulk and surface properties.","Silanes, Nanocomposites, Bisphenol a-glycidyl methacrylate, Operative dentistry, Hydrolysis, Polymerization, Toothbrushing"

Composite type significantly affected ID-A%, DC and DC-R% (p < 0.001), while light settings significantly affected ID-A% but not DC and DC-R% (p > 0.05). In both light settings, EvoPst showed the lowest DC-R% (<80%). Significance Internal defect and degree of conversion of bulk-fill composites were affected by their composition and light settings.

Composites were formulated containing BisGMA/TEGDMA/BisEMA and barium-aluminium-silicate glass (0FA). FA crystals were incorporated at 10 (10FA), 20 (20FA), 30 (30FA) and 40wt% (40FA) maintaining a filler content of 80wt% (63–67vol%). Degree of conversion (DC), flexural strength (FS), flexural modulus (FM), fracture toughness (K1C), Vickers hardness (HV) and 2-body wear were measured. Fluoride release was measured in neutral and acidic buffers. Results XRD and 19F MAS-NMR confirmed that only FA was formed, whilst SEM revealed the presence of single rods and bundles of nano-rods. DC ranged between 56–60% (p>0.05). FA composites showed lower FM and lower FS (p<0.05), but comparable wear resistance and HV (p>0.05) to 0FA. 30FA and 40FA showed similar K1C to 0FA (p>0.05), with SEM showing evidence of toughening mechanisms, whereas 10FA and 20FA showed lower K1C (p<0.05). FA containing composites released fluoride that was proportional to the amount of FA incorporated (p<0.05) but only under acidic conditions.

Methods A total of 104 patients (mean age: 42.1 years old) received 384 feldspathic ceramic laminate veneers on maxillary anterior teeth. Veneer preparations with incisal overlap were performed using a mock up technique. Existing resin composite restorations of acceptable quality were not removed but conditioned using silica coating and silanization. Immediate dentin sealing (IDS) was applied when more than 50% of dentin was exposed during preparation. Endodontically treated teeth were not excluded. After adhesive cementation, restorations were evaluated by calibrated evaluators at baseline and final follow-up using modified USPHS criteria. Results 225 Laminate veneers were bonded onto teeth without existing restorations, 159 on teeth with pre-existing resin composite restorations, 87 to teeth with more than 50% of exposed dentin surface and 43 to endodontically-treated teeth. In total, 19 failures were observed in form of debonding (n = 3), fracture (n = 15) and extraction due to endodontic complications (n = 1). In teeth with more than 50% of dentin exposure, a significant increase in survival rate was observed when IDS was used (96.4% versus 81.8%). No significant difference was found between teeth with and without pre-existing composite resin restorations (84.6% versus 95.5%) or between vital and non-vital teeth (95.6% versus 88.1%). Laminate veneers luted to endontically-treated teeth had a significant mis-match in color compared to vital teeth. Patients who smoked presented with significantly more marginal discoloration, but no intervention was needed. Patients scored favorably values on the Oral Health Impact Profile questionnaire and were generally satisfied with the treatment. In this clinical trial, the ceramic laminate veneers had a relatively high survival rate. Significance Teeth with more than 50% of dentin exposure significantly benefit from IDS. Pre-existing restorations or endodontic treatments do not have an effect on the survival rate of ceramic laminate veneers.

Although DIC has been widely used in engineering and biomechanical fields, it is in the spotlight only recently in dental materials. Therefore, the purpose of this review paper is introducing the working principle of the DIC technique with some modifications and providing further potential applications in various dental materials and related fields. Methods The accuracy of the algorithm depending on the environmental characteristics of the DIC technique, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of strain measurement using optical measurements, have been elaborated in dental materials and related fields. Applications to those researches have been classified into the following categories: shrinkage behavior of light-cured resin composite, resin-tooth interface, mechanical properties of tooth structure, crack extension and elastic properties of dental materials, and deformation of dental restoration and prosthesis. This classification and discussion were performed using literature survey and review based on numerous papers in the international journals published over the past 20 years. The future directions for predicting the precise deformation of dental materials under various environments, as well as limitations of the DIC technique, was presented in this review. Results The DIC technique was demonstrated as a more effective tool to measure full-field polymerization shrinkage of composite resin, even in a simulated clinical condition over the existing methods. Moreover, the DIC combined with other technologies can be useful to evaluate the mechanical behavior of material-tooth interface, dentine structure and restorative and prosthetic materials with high accuracy. Three-dimensional DIC using two cameras extended the measurement range in-plane to out-of-plane, enabling measure of the strain directly on the surface of dental restorations or prosthesis. Significance DIC technique is a potential tool for measuring and predicting the full-field deformation/strain of dental materials and actual prostheses in diverse clinical conditions. The versatility of DIC can replace the existing complex sensor devices in those studies.","Digital image correlation, Dental materials, Polymerization shrinkage, Mechanical properties, Tooth structure, Implant-supported prosthesis"

Methods 80 titanium inserts were scanned to design customized abutments and crowns. The specimens were divided into four groups (n = 20/material): (Z): zirconia, (P): PEEK, (V): VITA Enamic, and (E): IPS e.max. Each group was subdivided into two subgroups according to customized abutment material: (Z) zirconia, and (P) for PEEK. For the assessment of force absorption, all specimens were loaded in a universal testing machine, applied loads curves were collected from the machine’s software, and resulting loads curves were collected from forcemeter below the assembly. The slopes of all curves were analyzed using Two-way multivariate analysis of variance with pairwise comparisons using Tukey Post Hoc test (p < 0.05). Results The curve progression of the applied and resulting forces varied among the investigated materials for each specimen. For zirconia abutments, ZZ showed the highest slope values of the applied and resulting force curves, followed by EZ, VZ, and PZ demonstrating statistically significant differences (P < .001). As for PEEK abutments, ZP and EP showed the least slope values, followed by PP then VP demonstrating statistically significant differences (P < .001). For Zirconia and e.max crowns, using PEEK abutments significantly increased slope loss. As for PEEK and Vita Enamic crowns changing abutment material did not significantly affect slope loss. Significance Combining rigid crown materials with less rigid abutments might enhance their force absorption capacity.

This study aimed to characterize their interfacial interaction with dentin, to determine whether the 2-UA formulations achieve durable bonding to low C-factor flat dentin and to measure their water sorption. Methods Bonding effectiveness of 2-UAs that combine a 10-MDP-based primer with hydrophobic adhesive resins differing only for filler (BZF-21, BZF-29, and BZF-29_hv) were comparatively investigated with the commercial adhesive Clearfil SE Bond 2 (C-SE2, Kuraray Noritake). Adhesive-dentin interfaces were characterized with TEM. Adhesive-resin disks were immersed in distilled water at 37 °C for 1 week, 6 months and 1 year to measure water sorption and solubility. ‘Immediate’ and ‘aged’ micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) of the adhesives applied in etch-and-rinse (E&R) and self-etch (SE) bonding mode to low C-factor flat dentin were measured. Statistical analyses involved linear mixed-effects (LME) modelling and Kruskal-Wallis testing (p < 0.05). Results TEM revealed that E&R hybrid layers were more sensitive to aging than SE hybrid layers. Lower water sorption was recorded for all UAs compared with C-SE2. The immediate μTBS of BZF-21 and BZF-29 was not significantly different from that of C-SE2. The 1-year aged μTBS of all 2-UAs was significantly lower than that of C-SE2, except for BZF-29 applied in E&R mode. A significant reduction in μTBS upon 1-year aging was recorded for BZF-21 and BZF-29 applied in E&R mode. A significant difference in μTBS between E&R and SE bonding modes was recorded for all adhesives except BZF-21. Significance Experimental 2-UAs with a hydrophobic adhesive-resin design produced± 20-μm thick adhesive-resin layers, absorbed less water and resulted in bonding performance that was more aging-resistant when applied in SE than in E&R bonding mode. The silica-filled BZF-29 2-UA revealed the most comparable bonding performance with C-SE2 in a low C-factor condition (flat dentin).","Dental bonding, Composite resin, Bond durability, Water sorption, Interface, TEM"

From each composite material, samples (5 × 2 mm, n = 50) were prepared according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Lava™ Ultimate was used as blocks. All samples were ground to dust with a diamond bur (106 μm) and suspended in distilled water at 60 mg/mL. After storage for 72 h, the suspensions were separated into a soluble (eluate) and a particulate (dust) fraction. Eluates and dusts were evaluated for inhibition of Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence and cytotoxicity on human A549 lung cells (WST-1-Assay). The estrogenic activity was assessed by YES-Assay using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Additionally, dental monomers (BisGMA, BisEMA, UDMA, TEGDMA, HEMA) and Bisphenol A were investigated. Results All eluates showed inhibition of V. fischeri bioluminescence at concentrations above 1.1 mg/mL (p < 0.05). The activity of the eluates of ceram.x® universal and Filtek™ Supreme XTE was significantly higher than Lava™ Ultimate and Core-X™ flow (p < 0.05).

Methods Rectangular plates (10 ×10×1 mm3 of thickness) were cut from the blocks of composites Cerasmart 270 (CS), Katana Avencia (KA), Grandio Blocs (GB), and Lava Ultimate (LU). Specimens were stored in distilled water for up to 60 days at 37 °C, and non-stored specimens were used as a control (n = 5). Specimens were isothermally heated at 200 °C, and the water content was evaporated and transferred to the titration cell throughout a nitrogen gas flow. The KF coulometer determined the percentage of water in each specimen. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and Tukey`s test (α = 0.05). Results The water content of non-stored specimens ranged from 0.29 to 1.66 wt% (6.9–32.9 μg/mm3) for GB and LU, respectively. The water content increased underwater storage (0.82–2.96 wt% after 60 days). The extend of water sorption (11.9–26.1 μg/mm3) among the materials was directly related to their base water content. No additional water content increase was observed after 7 (LU and KA) or 21 (GB and CS) days. Measuring the water content in wt% or μg/mm3 affected the ranking of materials when KA and CS were analyzed. Significance Composites with higher base water content also presented higher water sorption. KF titrationshowed to be a reliable method to measure the water sorption of composites, including their base water content.","CAD/CAM, Karl Fischer titration, Resin composite, Water sorption"

Methods Composites containing 10, 20 and 30 mol% of ASEE in their organic matrix were formulated. Camphorquinone (CQ)/ethyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate (EDAB) (0.33 wt%/0.60 wt%), CQ/EDAB/Ivocerin® (0.33 wt%/0.60 wt%/0.10, 0.25 or 0.50 wt%), CQ/EDAB/SpeedCure 938 (SC-938) (0.33 wt%/0.60 wt%/0.30, 0.50 or 1.00 wt%) and Ivocerin® (0.50 wt%) were used as photoinitiator systems. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and the crosslink density were determined by DMTA measurements. The flexural strength/modulus and ambient light working time were assessed according to ISO 4049. The shrinkage force was evaluated using a universal testing machine. The double bond conversion (DBC) was determined by NIR spectroscopy. DBC, flexural strength and modulus were measured after the storage of the specimens in deionized water at 37 °C for 24 h. The DBC, flexural strength and modulus data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with p = 0.05 as significance level. Results ASEE-based composites containing the classical initiator system CQ/EDAB exhibited low mechanical properties (flexural strength/modulus) and DBC. The screening of various photoinitiator systems showed that composites based on CQ/EDAB/Ivocerin® (0.33 wt%/0.60 wt%/0.50 wt%), Ivocerin® (0.50 wt%) or CQ/EDAB/SC-938 (0.33 wt%/0.60 wt%/1.00 wt%) were particularly attractive. Indeed, the use of these photoinitiator systems enabled the formulation of composites containing up to 30 mol% ASEE exhibiting excellent mechanical properties, high DBC, good network homogeneity and low shrinkage force values. Interestingly, the addition of SC-938 did not impair the ambient light working time of the uncured composites, whereas the incorporation of 0.50 wt% Ivocerin® resulted in a strong decrease of this value. Significance The addition of the allyl sulfone ASEE in combination with the initiator system CQ/EDAB/SC-938 (0.33 wt%/ 0.60 wt%/ 1.00 wt%) is a promising strategy to develop low-shrinkage dental composites which exhibit excellent mechanical properties, low shrinkage force, high DBC and suitable ambient light working time.","Allyl sulfones, Addition-fragmentation chain transfer, Iodonium salt, Dental polymers, Radical photopolymerization, Light sensitivity, Shrinkage stress"

Methods Two-millimeter-thick samples of conventional sculptable [FiltekZ250 (FZ)], flowable [Filtek Ultimate Flow (FUF)] and polyacid-modified [Twinky Star Flow (TS)] RBCs, and four-millimeter-thick samples of flowable bulk-fill [Filtek Bulk Fill Flow (FBF), Surefil SDR (SDR)] and sculptable fibre-reinforced [EverX Posterior (EX)] RBCs were prepared in an eight-millimeter-deep mold. The RBCs temperature was pre-set to 25, 35 and 55°C. The RBCs were photopolymerized with the recommended and its double exposure time. The DC at the top and bottom was measured with micro-Raman spectroscopy. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and Scheffe post-hoc test (p<0.05). Results The differences in DC% between the top/bottom and the recommended/extended exposure time were significant for the materials, except SDR (64.5/63.0% and 67.4/63.0%). FUF (69.0% and 53.4%) and TS (64.9% and 60.9%) in 2mm provided higher DC% at the top and bottom with the recommended curing time, compared to the other materials, except SDR. Pre-heating had negative effect on DC at the bottom in flowable RBCs (FUF: 48.9%, FBF: 36.7%, SDR: 43%, TS: 54.7%). Pre-heating to 55 °C significantly increased the DC% in fibre-reinforced RBC (75.0% at the top, 64.7% at the bottom). Significance Increased exposure time improves the DC for each material. Among bulk-fills, only SDR performed similarly, compared to the two-millimeter-thick flowable RBCs. Pre-heating of low-viscosity RBCs decreased the DC% at the bottom.

Methods The products tested were Calibra Silane Coupling Agent/CS, G-Multi Primer/GM, Kerr Silane Primer/KS, Monobond Plus/MB and Scotchbond Universal Adhesive/SB. The silane status was studied by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C-NMR). The roughness parameters of polished (group A) and HF acid-etched (group B) lithium disilicate glass-ceramic surfaces were measured by optical profilometry (n = 5/group). The interaction of the products with group A and B ceramic surfaces was examined by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The shear strength (SBS) of a flowable composite bonded to the ceramic surfaces (groups A, B) was assessed before (NS) and after silane treatment (n = 20/group, product). Results The NMR analysis showed the presence of silanol monomers only in CS. Methoxylated-siloxane adducts were found in GM, silanol–siloxane adducts in MB, SB, and siloxane polymers in KS. Acid-etching greatly increased Sa, Sz, Sdr, Sc and Sv parameters (p < 0.001) and ATR-FTIR analysis demonstrated evidence of bonding with the substrate in CS. Weibull analysis of SBS revealed the following rankings in characteristic life (p < 0.05): CS > SB,KS,MB > GM > NS (group A) and CS > GM > SB,KS,MB,NS (group B). The most reliable treatment in both groups was CS. For the same silane treatment, the SBS of group B were significantly higher from group A. Failures were mainly of adhesive type, except of several partial resin cohesive failures found in group B. Significance The chemical bonding capacity of the silanes was highest in products with silanol monomers. Acid-etching increased bond strength to a level that neutralized the silane contribution in products with silanol–siloxane adducts and siloxane polymers, providing thus bond strength values similar to silane-free treatments.","Silane reactivity, NMR, IR, Ceramic roughness, Resin bonding, Glass ceramic"

Methods Bovine incisors (n = 160) were ground flat on the labial surfaces to expose dentin using a grinder and silicon carbide (SiC) abrasive papers under running water. Between preparation and bonding procedures, the crowns were stored in Chloramine-T solution at 4 °C. Eight different restorative materials were studied: Activa BioActive (ABA), Cention Forte (CNF), Ceram.x Spectra ST (CXS), Riva self-cure (RSC), Equia Forte (EQF), Fuji II LC (FJI), Ketac Molar (KTM), Surefil one (SFO). Four materials required pretreatment of the dental hard tissue before placement, whereas the other four were self-adhesive (no pretreatment). The specimens were mounted vertically in plaster. A preload of 5 N was applied and the subsequent cross-head speed was 0.8 mm/min. Shear bond strengths (MPa) were calculated as the failure load divided by the bonding area. Failure modes were recorded as adhesive, cohesive or pretest. Data were statistically analyzed via ordinal regression for inference and Tukey’s method to adjust for multiple comparisons. All computations were done using R version 4.1.2 (R Core Team 2021). Results Smax (failure stress in MPa) of the combined groups with pretreatment were significantly higher than the self-adhesive materials. The highest frequency of pretest-failure was seen with FJI. Glass-ionomer cements without pretreatment were the only restoratives with pretest failures. Amongst materials without pretreatment, SFO had the highest bond strengths. Significance The further reduction of the placement steps for materials used as an amalgam alternative, namely the omission of pretreatment of the dentin, results in these self-adhesive materials having lower bond strengths than materials that require pretreatment of the dentin.","Dentin, Shear bond strength, Self-adhesive, Pretreatment"

Ra and KHN were not influenced by PRG-Ca fillers (p<0.05). The higher the content of PRG-Ca, the lower FS, FM and TP (p<0.05). Wsp increased linearly with the content of PRG-Ca fillers (p<0.05). E6 presented the highest Wsl (p<0.05), while the Wsl of the other composites were not different from each other (p>0.05). Significance Incorporation of 10–40wt.% of PRG-Ca fillers endowed remineralizing potential to dental composites without jeopardizing the overall behavior of their physicochemical properties.

Fluoride release was followed using an ion selective electrode, whilst all other ions were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Apatite formation was followed by FTIR and XRD. SEM was used to follow glass degradation and apatite formation on both polished cross-sections and surfaces of the composites. ACT released very few ions including fluoride upon immersion in TB and AS7, but released more ions including significant quantities of Al in AS4. This would suggest the glasses in ACT are acid degradable fluoro-alumino-silicate glasses similar to the glasses used in glass ionomer cements. There was no evidence of any apatite formation with ACT. CN released more ions in TB and AS7 than ACT and formed an apatite like phase in AS7. The calcium fluoro-silicate glass in CN was observed to degrade significantly in AS4.

Methods Acrylic denture base samples were prepared by a Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing technique reinforced with different concentrations (0.10, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) of silanated TiO2 NPs. The resulting nanocomposite materials were characterized in terms of degree of conversion (DC), and sorption/solubility flexural strength, impact strength, Vickers hardness and Martens hardness and compared with unmodified resin and conventional heat-cured (HC) material. The nanocomposites were reassessed after subjecting them to ageing in artificial saliva. A fractured surface was studied under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results The addition of TiO2 NPs into 3D-printed resin significantly improved flexural strength/modulus, impact strength, Vickers hardness, and DC, while also slightly enhancing Martens hardness compared to the unmodified resin. Sorption values did not show any improvements, while solubility was reduced significantly. The addition of 0.10 wt% NPs provided the highest performance amongst the other concentrations, and 0.75 wt% NPs showed the lowest. Although ageing degraded the materials’ performance to a certain extent, the trends remained the same. SEM images showed a homogenous distribution of the NPs at lower concentrations (0.10 and 0.25 wt%) but revealed agglomeration of the NPs with the higher concentrations (0.50 and 0.75 wt%). Significance The outcomes of this study suggested that the incorporation of TiO2 NPs (0.10 wt%) into 3D-printed denture base material showed superior performance compared to the unmodified 3D-printed resin even after ageing in artificial saliva.

The influence of interfacial reactive groups on shrinkage stress is explored. Methods Oligomers of varying lengths and with varying number of reactive groups along the length were synthesized by modifying commercial oligomers. Surface of silica fillers (OX50) was treated with methylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane and this was further reacted with the synthesized oligomers to obtain a series of polymer brushes on the surface. Fillers modified with γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane were used as a control. Filler surface treatment was confirmed using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Fillers were added at 30 wt % to a resin made of BisGMA/TEGDMA and polymerization kinetics, shrinkage stress, volumetric shrinkage, flexural strength and modulus, viscosity were measured. Results Composites with polymer brush functionalized fillers showed up to a 30 % reduction in shrinkage stress as compared to the control, with no reduction in flexural strength and modulus. Shrinkage stress reduced with increasing length of the polymer brush and increased with increase in number of reactive groups along the length of the polymer brush.

Results For the survival analysis, Weibull modulus (β) and characteristic lifetime (η) were similar among groups. Yet, for the success analysis, in which only restorations that were free of technical complications were ranked as success, the bulk-fill technique resulted in higher β, while the combined technique produced restorations with higher η, for teeth that had their cusp removed. C-technique also resulted in smaller gaps than I and B. Significance The effect of the layering technique on the success of restorations was dependent on the cavity extension. The combined technique favors the adaptation and the longevity of extensively damaged teeth.","Permanent dental restoration, Resin composite, Endodontics, Fatigue"

Material and methods Four model PICN materials sintered at different temperatures (Exp.125, Exp.130, Exp.135 and Exp.155) were investigated along with three CAD/CAM resin composites; Lava Ultimate (LU), Cerasmart (CS) and Grandio Bloc (GB), and one commercial PICN block - Vita Enamic (VE). Forty samples were prepared with dimensions of 14 × 12 × 2 mm for resin ceramic and VE blocks and 15 × 2 mm discs for model PICN materials. All samples were scanned using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (n = 3) at multiple locations and two different scan sizes (20 ×20 µm and 3 ×3 µm). Surface optical gloss (n = 5) at 60° was also determined for all the groups. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA, and Tukey’s post hoc test (α = 0.05). Results Resin composite blocks showed smoother surfaces compared to the PICN materials. The average surface roughness values (Ra) ranged from 7.75 nm to 31.21 nm and the gloss value ranged from 56.43 GU to 91.81 GU. The highest surface roughness value was found for Exp.125 (31.21 nm) while LU showed the lowest roughness value (7.75 nm) (the difference being statistically significant: p = 0.001). Variation was noticed in terms of nanomechanical mapping within and between the groups. Images generated from the elastic modulus map values clearly indicated that all PICN materials had more than one phase and very different components. Conclusions CAD/CAM resin composite blocks exhibited higher gloss and lower roughness values compared to PICN materials. However, both the commercial and model PICN materials showed more stiffness than resin composite with the presence of at least two different phases. Sintering temperature appears to have a significant effect on material topography and nanomechanical properties. The model PICN sintered at 1550 °C showed a comparable range of elastic modulus values to those of enamel.","Polymer-infiltrated, Alumina, CAD/CAM, Resin composites, Elastic modulus, Atomic force microscopy"

Methods 15 CAD/CAM Blocks of Vita Enamic (VE) were randomly sectioned into three mechanical pre-treatments: (1.) Diamond bur (D), (2.) Airborne abrasion (A), (3.) Tribochemical silica coating (T) and subsequently five chemical pre-treatments: (1.) Clearfil SE Bond Bond (B; negative control), (2.) ESPE Sil (S), (3.) Clearfil Ceramic Primer Plus (CPP), (4.) Clearfil Repair (CR) and (5.) Scotchbond Universal (SCB). Per block, n = 20 specimens were sawn. Half of the specimens were randomly selected and subjected to an immediate bond strength test, while the other half was subjected to artificial aging for 6 months 180 days at 37 °C and subsequent thermocycling of 5000 cycles. A μTBS was performed and data (MPa) were compared in one-way and two-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD. Paired-t-test was used for artificial aging (α = 0.05). Debonded specimens were analyzed of for failure modes with a stereomicroscope (SEM). Results The results of one-way ANOVA for the fifteen fastening procedures after aging indicated significant differences according to SCB-A and CPP-T. Two-way ANOVA after aging observed inferior bond strength for SCB. No differences were observed for mechanical pre-treatments. Artificial aging showed a significant reduction in bond strength on most of the fastening procedures. Significance SCB showed the lowest bond strength values besides B, S, CPP, and CR.

The aim of this research investigation is to determine, through a comparative cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment, the environmental impacts of three direct-placement dental restorative materials (DRMs) and their associated packaging. Methods Three direct-placement dental materials; dental amalgam, resin-based composite (RBC) and glass polyalkenoate cements (GIC) are assessed using primary data from a manufacturer (SDI Limited, Australia). The functional unit consisted of ‘one dental restoration’ of each restorative system under investigation: 1.14 g of dental amalgam; 0.25 g of RBC (plus the adhesive = 0.10 g); and 0.54 g of GIC. The system boundary per restoration included the raw materials and their associated packaging materials for each DRM together with the processing steps for both the materials and packaging. The environmental impacts were assessed using an Egalitarian approach under the ReCiPe method using Umberto software and the Ecoinvent database. Nine different impact categories were used to compare the environmental performance of these materials. Results Dental amalgam had the highest impact across most of the categories, but RBC had the highest Global Warming Potential. The highest sources of the environmental impacts for each restorative material were: Amalgam, derived from material use; RBC, derived from energy use in processing material and packaging material; GIC, derived from material and energy use for packaging. Significance Less intensive energy sources or more sustainable packaging materials can potentially reduce the impacts associated with RBC and GIC thus making them suitable alternatives to dental amalgam.","Environmental impacts, LCA, Dental amalgam, Dental composite, Glass ionomer cement, Dental materials, Sustainability"

Methods EPF from fifteen general dental practices were used for collecting the data for this study. From the EPF, 321,749 composite restorations placed in 52,245 patients by forty-seven GDPs between January 2000 and December 2011 were included. Kaplan–Meier statistics were applied and mean AFRs over 2, 5 and 10 years were calculated. The effect on the AFR of using different levels of failure: based on Claims data (CD), Success (SUC), Survival (SUR) and different inclusion criteria of tooth/restoration variables were reported. Results Highest AFRs were found for level CD, in which every intervention was considered as failure, and the lowest AFRs for level SUR in which repairs and an endodontic treatments were not considered as a failure. AFRs increased when the observation period prolonged especially for SUR, followed by SUC and CD. An overview of long-term survival studies showed a wide variation in study design, performed clinical examination (USPHS criteria or GDP), number of restorations included, description of restoration failure and found AFRs for CD, SUC and SUR.

Methods Specimens (n=8) of the 3D printing materials 3Delta temp, NextDent C&B, Freeprint temp were additively manufactured by DLP 3D printer. Postprocessing was carried out according to the manufacturer's specifications. Telio CAD were cut out of blocks, Tetric EvoCeram was applied directly and light cured. Three-body wear was simulated with an ACTA machine. Data were statistically analysed (ANOVA, post hoc test: Tukey, p<0.05). The worn surfaces of the specimens were examined with a FE-SEM. Results The average mean wear was 50±15μm for Tetric EvoCeram<62±4μm for 3Delta temp<236±31μm for Telio CAD<255±13μm for NextDent C&B<257±24μm for Freeprint temp. After 200,000 cycles, the wear and wear rates for Tetric EvoCeram and 3Delta temp were significantly lower than those for the other materials. SEM revealed that 3Delta temp has a higher filler proportion than the other 3D printing materials but less than Tetric EvoCeram. Significance The filler content influences the wear behaviour of additively manufactured materials as well as dental restorative composite materials. While most 3D printing materials have a low inorganic filler load, which qualifies the materials for temporary use only, one 3D printing material has an optimized composition that would qualify the material for longer clinical service time if wear is considered as the outcome variable.","3D printing, Additive manufacturing, Temporary dental materials, Wear"

Methods Five commercial dental composites were evaluated, including three dual-cure bulk-fill composites (BulkEZ, HyperFIL and Injectafil), one light-cure bulk-fill composite Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable (FBF) and one traditional incremental composite Filtek Z250 (Z250) as controls. Specimens were prepared in two different depths (0.5 mm and 5 mm) for 20 s light irradiation. Self-cure was also evaluated for the three dual-cure composites. The polymerization kinetics were measured continuously in real-time for at least 10 min using a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. The experimental kinetic data were fitted using two mathematical models — a sigmoidal function and a superposition of two exponential functions characterizing the gel phase and glass phase. The degree of conversion (DC) and the rate of polymerization were calculated for all test conditions. Results Both experimental FTIR measurements and mathematical modeling revealed distinct depth-related polymerization kinetics for BulkEZ compared to the other two dual-cure composites. Specifically, BulkEZ exhibited moderately-paced polymerization kinetics at both depths while HyperFIL and Injectafil exhibited faster polymerization at 0.5 mm and slower polymerization at 5 mm. The bulk-fill FBF and incremental Z250 exhibited relatively fast polymerization at both depths, a characteristic for light-cure. The DC values at the two depths were not significantly different for BulkEZ, but significantly higher at 0.5 mm than at 5 mm for the other four composites (α = 0.05). Significance Polymerization kinetics and their depth variation for dual-cure bulk-fill composites are material dependent. The distinct depth-related polymerization kinetics revealed for BulkEZ compared to other composites may affect their contraction stress and clinical performance.","Polymerization kinetics, Degree of conversion, Rate of polymerization, FTIR spectroscopy, Dental composites, Bulk-fill, Light-cure, Dual-cure"

Methods Experimental resin composites containing 7.5% of DHMAI were incubated in a biological medium in the presence of a Streptococcus Mutans (SM) strain during 3 months. The physicochemical, mechanical, and thermal properties, before and after 3 months of aging, were evaluated using: Degree of Conversion (DC), Residual Functions (RF), Vitreous Transition (Tg), Thermal Expansion Coefficient (CTE) and thermal degradation using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis (FTIRATR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermo Mechanical analyses (TMA) and Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TG). Results Incorporation of DHAMI increased DC and decreased RF. After aging, DHMAI decreased and slowed RF release. Incorporation of 7.5% DHAMI provided significant modification of the thermal behavior (Tg and thermal degradation) but did not affect CTE. After aging, DHMAI enhanced the structural stability and improved resistance against biodegradation compared to the control composite.

Considering the advantages of additive manufacturing technology, this study introduced the feasibility of developing a 3D printed resin-based composition modified with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) to improve properties. Methods Acrylate-based resin was impregnated with different concentrations of GNPs (0.0–0.25 wt%), and then different aspects such as mechanical, physical, biological and antimicrobial were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness. TEM and SEM were used to characterize GNPs and their existence within the resin. Surface topography and roughness were evaluated using AFM. The degree of conversion and composition were confirmed by FTIR. Mechanical properties were detected using bending strength, microhardness and nanoindentation. Biocompatibility and antimicrobial activities were assessed with oral fibroblast and Candida albicans (C. albicans), respectively. In addition, most of the measurements were performed repeatedly after 3 months of storage in artificial saliva to evaluate performance. Results GNPs improved strength significantly at low concentrations ≤ 0.05 wt%, while the addition up to 0.25 wt% enhanced printed nanocomposite hardness and elasticity. The modification did not induce a toxic response, as its biocompatibility was within the recommended range of biomedical devices. Antimicrobial activity was of prominence, as GNPs showed an outstanding route of reducing C. albicans activity associated with filler proportion.

Methods Resin composite molds (3 mm width, 4 mm depth) were treated with Clearfil SE Bond 2 and restored with 3 techniques : (1) Surefil SDR flow (SDR) placed in bulk (BLK), (2) SDR placed in two unequal increments (INC) and (3) SDR placed after an increment of SDR placed with wetted polyethylene fiber (Ribbond Ultra) at the cavity floor (FRC). As a control, the cavities were bulk-filled with SDR and no bonding agent (n = 12). All the specimens were subjected to real-time and 3D imaging by SS-OCT (1330 nm) to calculate the total volume of gap formed (mm3) at the cavity floor and between the composite increments. For MTBS, the occlusal cavities of the similar dimensions (3 × 3 × 4 mm3) were prepared on extracted molars with similar composite placement techniques (BLK, INC and FRC). After 24 h 37 °C water storage, the specimens were sectioned using a diamond saw to create 0.7 × 0.7 mm2 beams for MTBS, and subjected to bond testing at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Data for both tests was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and multiple-comparisons with Bonferroni correction (α = 0.05). Results The gap volumes were different among the groups (p < 0.05). The largest cavity floor gaps (mm3) were observed in the control group (2.00 ± 0.08); followed by BLK (0.74 ± 0.20) and INC (0.02 ± 0.01). In FRC, the cavity floor was gap-free in all specimens but some separation was observed between the two increments. MTBS values (MPa) were 13.8 ± 7.6, 31.7 ± 12.5 and 28.3 ± 8.5 for BLK, INC and FRC groups. There was no significant difference between FRC and INC and both were different from BLK (p < 0.05). Significance Gap formation of the bulk-fill composite at cavity floor was significantly reduced with the placement of a fiber-reinforced increment at the base of the deep preparation. The fiber-reinforced increment acts as a shrinkage stress breaker and protects the bonded interface at deep dentin.","Polymerization shrinkage, Fiber-reinforced composite, Bulk fill, Bond strength, Gap"

Methods A virtual incisor tooth preparation was produced with a reduction of 1.5mm at the incisal edge and of 0.7mm buccally. A .STL file of the preparation was generated and CAD/CAM based G10 dentin-analog material was used for testing. Laminate veneers were milled in three different materials: lithium-disilicate (LDS, E.max CAD), resin-nanoceramic (RN, Lava Ultimate), and feldspathic-ceramic (FELDS, Vita Blocks). SSALT was employed where a spherical indenter contacted the veneer, slided along its interface with G10 to lift off and start a new cycle at 2Hz in water. Qualitative fractography was performed. The probability of survival (90% confidence-bounds) was calculated for several load/cycle missions. Results The probability of survival for a mission of 50,000 cycles decreased from 50 up to 150N equally for all groups and were not different between them. At 200N, the probability of survival was significantly lower for FELDS (10%) compared to RN veneers (41%), whereas LDS presented intermediate values (22%). The characteristic strength of RN (247N) was significantly higher than LDS (149N), and FELDS (151N). In FELDS and LDS, hackles, wake hackles and twist hackles indicated the direction of crack propagation. In RN, hackles were observed.

This study focuses on assessing the in vitro biocompatibility of two novel bioactive restorative materials. Methods Specimens of the bioactive restorative materials, Cention Forte (CF) and ACTIVA BioACTIVE RESTORATIVE (AB), a glass ionomer cement/glass hybrid (EQUIA Forte HT, EF) and an established nanohybrid composite (Venus Diamond, VD) were produced and finished. The specimens were eluted in water and methanol and the resulting eluates were analyzed via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. hGF-1 cells were exposed to eluates prepared in cell culture medium. Cellular ATP levels, oxidized glutathione concentration, caspase-3/7 activity and the inflammatory response (IL-6 and PGE2 levels) were determined. Microscopic images were taken to examine the cell morphology. Results Methyl methacrylate and 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate were the main monomers detected in CF and AB eluates. All materials inhibited cell proliferation and led to significantly reduced ATP-levels. The cells exhibited a healthy morphology in the presence of CF and AB. Cells exposed to VD showed increased oxidized glutathione levels. Only EF led to enhanced caspase-3/7 activity. CF and AB caused IL-6 levels to increase, while EF and AB led to enhanced PGE2 levels.

Methods The degree of conversion (DC %) and extent of acid neutralization (SY %) of PU were measured on dual- (DC) and self-cured (SC) specimens after 10, 30 and 60 min storage by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, whereas the presence of silanols was traced by curve-fitting the 60 min spectra, using the silane-free analog (Panavia SA Plus-PS) as a control. The role of a dedicated adhesive (Clearfil Universal Bond Quick-CU) in assisting the early DC % in PU-SC was investigated on 10 min-stored specimens. The water contact angles on polished and HF acid-etched lithium disilicate surfaces (IPS e.max Press), were assessed before and after silanization by unset PU or a silane primer (Ultradent Silane-SL). Finally, the shear strength of PU-DC specimens bonded to the acid-etched ceramic surfaces was determined before and after SL treatment. Results The DC % was higher in DC than SC (PU, PS; all time intervals), in PU-SC than PS-SC (30, 60 min) and in the CU assisted PU-SC group. The SY % was lower in DC than SC (PU, PS) and higher in PS-SC than PU-SC groups. Silanols were found only in unset PU and PU-DC groups. SL treatment provided higher water contact angles on polished and acid-etched ceramic surfaces and higher shear bond strength on acid-etched ceramic surfaces than PU (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Significance Although the degree of conversion of the silane containing luting agent was improved in the self-curing mode, especially in the adhesive assisted group, it was still inferior to light-curing. Acid-neutralization and presence of silanols were affected by the setting modes. The use of a silane primer enhanced the hydrophobicity and bond strength of the silane containing luting agent with the etched ceramic substrate.","Silane containing self-adhesive luting agent, Degree of conversion, Acid neutralization, Silanol content, Contact angle measurements, Bond strength, Lithium disilicate ceramic, ATR-FTIR"

Methods Two ion releasing RBCs, Activa (ACT) and Cention-N (CN) were compared to a conventional RBC (Z350) and a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji-II-LC). The DoC was measured in a 10-mm deep semi-circular metal mold with a 2-mm internal radius (n = 8). The molds were irradiated from one end for 20-s. The Knoop hardness (KH) was measured at 0.5-mm intervals from the surface after the specimens had been stored at 37 °C for 24-h. To measure the KIC, single-edge-notched specimens (n = 15/group) were prepared (25×5x2.5-mm) for a 3-point bending test and then stored for either 1 or 30-days in water at 37 °C. Disk-shaped specimens (n = 10) were subjected to 250,000-load cycles of 49-N using a chewing simulator against spherical steatite antagonists. DoC and wear data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests (p ≤ 0.05). KIC data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and one-way ANOVA, and the Tukey post hoc test (p ≤ 0.05). In addition, an independent t-test was used to determine if storage time had any effect (α = 0.05) on the KIC of each material. Results Maximum hardness value was the highest for Z350 and the lowest for ACT. The depth at which 80% of the maximum KH, was the highest for CN (9.2 mm) and the lowest for Z350 (2 mm). All tested materials met the manufacturers’ claims for DoC. After 1-day, the highest KIC values were recorded for ACT and the lowest for Fuji-II-LC. Water storage (30-days) significantly reduced the KIC value for all materials except Fuji-II-LC. The highest wear rate values were recorded for CN followed by ACT. Significance All tested materials met their manufacturers’ claims for DoC. Water storage for 30-days significantly reduced the fracture toughness for ACT and CN. Wear was significantly higher for ACT and CN.","Resin composites, Ion release, Water storage, Depth of cure, Fracture toughness, Wear"

(2) To investigate the effect of loading rate on the creep and recovery behavior under bulk compressive creep test. Methods Cylindrical composite resin specimens were subjected to bulk compressive creep test with conventional and modified methodology (with/without introduction of stainless steel hemisphere and preload process). Furthermore, specimens undertook different loading rates ranging from 1 N/s to 50 N/s. Maximum deformation, creep deformation, permanent set as well as percentage of recovery during the creep and recovery procedure were compared, and surface topography changes before and after preload process was evaluated by laser scanning confocal. Burgers model was used to investigate the effect of improvements to each part of viscoelastic deformation of resin specimens. Results (1) The influence of surface evenness of resin specimens could be reduced by addition of preload process before the bulk compressive creep test resulting in significantly decreased permanent set (p = 0.002), and increased recovery to 91.7 % (p < 0.001). While the standard deviation of maximum deformation, permanent set and percentage of recovery had the smallest values when hemisphere was introduced to loading chain. (2) With increasing loading rate of bulk compressive creep tests, creep deformation increased and this trend became statistically significant when the loading rate reached 50 N/s.

Methods 3 CAD-CAM resin-based composite or polymer infiltrated ceramic network blocs, 1 lithium disilicate CAD-CAM ceramic (LS2), 3 direct resin composites, amalgam and bovine enamel were tested. For 2BW, 8 flat specimens per material were produced, grinded, polished, stored wet (37 °C, 28d) and tested (49 N, 37 °C, 1,200,000 cycles) against zirconia. For 3BW, specimens (n = 10) were stored accordingly, and tested against a zirconia antagonist wheel (3Y-TZP, d = 20 mm, h = 6 mm; 200,000 cycles, F = 15 N, f = 1 Hz, 15% slip) in millet seed suspension. Wear resistance was analysed in a 3D optical non-contact profilometer, measuring vertical wear depth and volume loss for 2BW and mean wear depth and roughness (Ra) for 3BW. Vickers hardness (15 s, HV2) was measured. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney-U test, p < 0.05). Results 2BW and 3BW have a different impact on material surfaces. Similar wear resistance was observed for direct and indirect resin based materials with analogous filler configurations in both methods. Bovine enamel exhibited the best wear resistance in 2BW, but the least wear resistance in 3BW against zirconia. Regarding 2BW, a direct/indirect composite material pair of the same manufacturer showed the significantly highest mean volume losses (2.72/2.85 mm³), followed by LS2 (1.41 mm³). LS2 presented the best wear resistance in 3BW (mean wear depth 2.85 µm), combined with the highest mean Vickers hardness (598 MPa). No linear correlation was found between Vickers hardness and both wear testing procedures. The zirconia antagonists showed no recordable signs of wear. Significance Dental restorative materials behave differently in 2BW and 3BW laboratory testing. Vickers hardness testing alone cannot hold for a correlation with wear behavior of materials.

An enhancement of metabolic activity at day 5 was observed in cells treated with EXF extracts. Significance EXF had a significantly higher fracture toughness validating its potential use as a restorative material in stress bearing areas. EXF showed higher shrinkage stress values, and less cytotoxic effect.

Models exist for other fields than dentistry. They have been compared to 3-point bending test experimental results for yield stress, flexural modulus and flexural strength. Methods Five formulations of the same experimental material were made. They were composed of an organic matrix and different ratios of silanated barium glass particles. The samples were stored in distilled water for 24h at 37°C prior to the 3-point bending test. The Turcsányi model for yield stress was notably investigated, and SEM was used to complete data analysis. Results The yield stress showed reproducible results and a good fit with Turcsányi model with respect to filler ratio. The flexural modulus data are not scattered but did not fit with the existing models. No trend could emerge for flexural strength and strain because of scattering; these properties are more unpredictable. The SEM observations of fracture areas confirm a good matrix-filler interface quality. Significance SEM pictures validated the numerical parameter obtained from Turcsányi model. The latter therefore seems to be applicable to dental composites. Firstly, it enables to predict the evolution of the material yield stress without testing all filler ratios. Secondly, this model provides a good way to get micro-information on the matrix-filler interface from macroscopic tests. The discrepancy between flexural modulus results and theory highlighted the necessity to include an “interface quality” parameter in accurate predictive models.","Dental composite, Bending test, Interface, Mechanical characterization, Micro-macro relation"

Recently, partial adhesive restorations have been widely proposed to increase the survival rate of endodontically treated teeth. The primary purpose of this review is to assess the failure rate of indirect partial adhesive restorations on endodontically treated teeth (ETT), considering the follow-up period. Methods The indications reported in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) were used to draft the present review. The study was constructed on PICO questions: population (patients who need indirect adhesive restorative treatment on endodontically treated teeth with onlay and overlay), intervention (onlay and overlay), control (patients with onlay and overlay on endodontically treated teeth) and outcome (failure rate and types of failure for onlay and overlay). The asked scientific question was: what are the failure rate and types of failure for adhesive indirect partial restorations on ETT? Results The overall failure rate that emerges is 0.087 with a ratio of 121/1254, I2 80 % p-value< 0.001. Moreover, by meta-regression with covariates the follow-up period reports a coefficient of 0.013 with a P-value< 0.001. In conclusion, the indirect partial restorations on endodontically treated teeth displayed overall acceptable outcomes in terms of success from 2 to 4 years after their placement with only 4.32 % of failure. Failures increase after 7 years up to 12–30 years with failure rates of approximatively 10.65 % and 20.94 %. The analysis of the included articles reporting the causes of restorations failures showed that 15.51 % of cases were related to the loss of dental element. Significance Besides the survival rates of indirect adhesive restorations on endodontically treated posterior teeth, it was highlighted that the majority of failures appeared restorable. Thus, partial restorations seemed able to prevent the ETT tooth loss.","Inlay, Onlay, Overlay, Partial crown, Indirect restoration, endodontically treated teeth"

Methods Some mechanical properties (flexural properties and fracture toughness) of Bio-SFRC in comparison with commercial inert (G-aenial Flo X) and ion-releasing materials (ACTIVA-BioActive Base/Liner and Fuji II LC) were assessed (n = 8/group). Calcium-release at different time-points was measured during the first six weeks by using a calcium-ion selective electrode.

This study intended to assess the remineralization efficiency of adhesive with dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) on initial caries lesion of biofilm-coated enamel. Methods Artificial initial carious lesion was created via 72-hour immersion in demineralization solution and cariogenic biofilm was formed after 24-hour culture of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). Specimens were then divided into 4 groups: enamel control, enamel treated with NACP, DMAHDM and NACP+DMAHDM respectively. Samples next underwent 7-day cycling, 4 h in BHIS (brain heart infusion broth containing 1 % sucrose) and 20 h in AS (artificial saliva) per day. The pH of BHIS was tested daily. So did the concentration of calcium and phosphate in BHIS and AS. Live/dead staining, colony-forming unit (CFU) count, and lactic acid production of biofilms were measured 7 days later. The enamel remineralization efficiency was evaluated by microhardness testing and transverse microradiography (TMR) quantitatively. Results Enamel of NACP+DMAHDM group demonstrated excellent remineralization effectiveness. And the NACP+DMAHDM adhesive released a great number of Ca2+ and PO43- ions, increased pH to 5.81 via acid neutralization, decreased production of lactic acid, and reduced CFU count of S. mutans (P < 0.05).

Methods Specimens are manufactured by mixing low AR (50/70/100) micro-sized glass fibres with two different weight fractions (5%/10%) into UDMA/TEGDMA based resin. Particulate filler composite (PFC) containing 55% glass fillers is used as the control group. Dynamic oscillatory strain sweep tests are conducted to analyse the linear viscoelastic behaviour. Solid-to fluidic transition behaviour of dental composites is also calculated in terms of flow and yield stresses. Furthermore, the oscillatory frequency sweep tests are conducted at three different strains (0.5%, 5% and 50%) resembling the positioning of unset paste onto restorations for different real-life clinical situations. Additionally, stickiness of dental composites with handling instrument (steel) and dentine covered with bonding agent is also evaluated. Results The results suggested the all the FRC groups exhibited non-Newtonian, shear-thinning behaviour. It is further established that inclusion of 5% of 50/70AR fibres into dental composites does not affect the flowability. Simultaneously, stickiness with dentine covered with bonding agent is more for these two compositions as compared to that of handling instrument (steel). Significance This study suggest that visco-elastic properties of dental composites are greatly affected by the type of filler (spherical shaped particulate fillers or rod-shaped fibres) as well as fibre weight fraction/fibre AR. This phenomenon can be attributed to the varying interactions between micro-sized fibres of different AR/weight fraction, particulate fillers and monomers.","Fibre reinforced dental composite, Low aspect ratio S-Glass fibre, Rheology, Flow stresses, Yield stresses"

However, stress induced microcracks from polymerization shrinkage, thermal and other stresses along with the low fracture toughness of methacrylate-based composites remain significant problems. Herein, the study focuses on applying a dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC)-based adaptive interface to conventional BisGMA/TEGDMA (70:30) dental resins by coupling moieties capable of thiol–thioester (TTE) DCC to the resin–filler interface as a means to induce interfacial stress relaxation and promote interfacial healing. Methods Silica nanoparticles (SNP) are functionalized with TTE-functionalized silanes to covalently bond the interface to the network while simultaneously facilitating relaxation of the filler–matrix interface via DCC. The functionalized particles were incorporated into the otherwise static conventional BisGMA/TEGDMA (70:30) dental resins. The role of interfacial bond exchange to enhance dental composite performance in response to shrinkage and other stresses, flexural modulus and toughness was investigated. Shrinkage stress was monitored with a tensometer coupled with FTIR spectroscopy. Flexural modulus/strength and flexural toughness were characterized in three-point bending on a universal testing machine. Results A reduction of 30% in shrinkage stress was achieved when interfacial TTE bond exchange was activated while not only maintaining but also enhancing mechanical properties of the composite. These enhancements include a 60% increase in Young’s modulus, 33% increase in flexural strength and 35% increase in the toughness, relative to composites unable to undergo DCC but otherwise identical in composition. Furthermore, by combining interfacial DCC with resin-based DCC, an 80% reduction of shrinkage-induced stress is observed in a thiol–ene system “equipped” with both types of DCC mechanisms relative to the composite without DCC in either the resin or at the resin–filler interface. Significance This behavior highlights the advantages of utilizing the DCC at the resin–filler interface as a stress-relieving mechanism that is compatible with current and future developments in the field of dental restorative materials, nearly independent of the type of resin improvements and types that will be used, as it can dramatically enhance their mechanical performance by reducing both polymerization and mechanically applied stresses throughout the composite lifetime.","Adaptive interface, Interfacial stress relaxation, Thiol–thioester exchange, Dynamic covalent chemistries, Composites"

Methods This polymer was incorporated as an ingredient into toothpaste and the fusion process was studied by electron microscopy and by synchrotron-based X-ray tomography microscopy (SRXTM) techniques. Results The data showed that toothpaste, supplemented with the amorphous Ca-polyP microparticles (aCa-polyP-MP), not only reseals tooth defects on enamel, like carious lesions, and dentin, including exposed dentinal tubules, but also has the potential to induce re-mineralization in the enamel and dentin regions. The formation of a regeneration mineralic zone on the tooth surface induced by aCa-polyP-MP was enhanced upon exposure to artificial saliva, as demonstrated by SRXTM. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis revealed an increase in the calcium/phosphorus atomic ratio of the enamel deposits to values characteristic for the particles during the treatment with polyP applied in the toothpaste, indicating a fusion of the particles with the tooth mineral. Significance Our results suggest that toothpaste enriched with aCa-polyP-MP is a promising biomimetic material for accelerating enamel and dentin restoration.","Inorganic polyphosphate, Microparticles, Dentifrice, Alkaline phosphatase, Coavervate, Regeneration, Enamel/dentin damage repair, Caries"

Methods Composites were prepared by adding poly(propylene glycol) dimethacrylate (24 wt%), camphorquinone (1 wt%) and MDP (0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20 wt%) or 4-META (3%) to urethane dimethacrylate. These were mixed with glass fillers containing 8 wt% monocalcium phosphate and 4 wt% polylysine (powder-liquid ratio of 3:1). Continuous spectral changes, following 20 s light exposure (37 °C), were assessed with an ATR-FTIR to monitor polymerisation kinetics (n = 3). Final extrapolated conversions (DC,max) were employed to calculate polymerisation shrinkage. BFS and modulus of 24-h dry stored disc specimens (10 × 1 mm; n = 10) were determined using a ball-on-ring jig setup. Results Maximum rate of polymerisation and DC,max increased linearly from 2.5 to 3.5% s−1 and 67 to 83%, respectively, upon increasing MDP from 0 to 20 wt%. Values with 3% 4-META were 2.6% s−1 and 78%. Shrinkage was 3.8 ± 0.3% for all formulations. Raising 4-META or MDP from 0 to 3 versus 5%, respectively, increased strength from 106 to 145 versus 136 MPa. A decreasing trend with higher MDP concentrations was noted. Elastic modulus showed no specific trend upon MDP increase. Significance Whilst final conversion levels were enhanced by 3% 4-META or >5% MDP, trends did not correlate with strength. Peak strengths with 3% 4-META or 5% MDP may therefore be due to acidic monomers providing linkage between the hydrophilic, non-silane treated particles and the polymer matrix.","10-MDP, Degree of conversion, Flexural strength, Photopolymerization, Self-adhesive composite"

The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a novel photo-cured nanocomposite with strong mechanical properties and high levels of sustained F ion release via a two-step “co-precipitation + spray-drying” technique to synthesize CaF2 nanoparticles (nCaF2); and (2) investigate the effect of spray-drying treatment after co-precipitation of nCaF2 on mechanical properties and F ion release of composite. Methods Two types of CaF2 particles were synthesized: A co-precipitation method yielded CaF2cp; “co-precipitation + spray-drying” yielded nCaF2cpsd. Composites were fabricated with fillers of: (1) 0% CaF2 + 70% glass; (2) 10% CaF2cp + 60% glass; (3) 15% CaF2cp + 55% glass; (4) 20% CaF2cp + 50% glass; (5) 10% nCaF2cpsd + 60% glass; (6) 15% nCaF2cpsd + 55% glass; and (7) 20% nCaF2cpsd + 50% glass. A commercial F-releasing nanocomposite served as control. Results The nCaF2cpsd had much smaller particle size (median = 32 nm) and narrower distribution (22–57 nm) than CaF2cp (median = 5.25 μm, 162 nm–67 μm). The composite containing nCaF2cpsd had greater flowability, flexural strength, elastic modulus and hardness than CaF2cp composite and commercial control composite. At 84-day immersion in water, the nanocomposites containing 20% nCaF2cpsd had 65 times higher cumulative F release, and 77 times greater long-term F-release rate, than commercial control. Conclusions A novel two-step “co-precipitation + spray-drying” technique of synthesizing nCaF2 was developed. The photo-cured nanocomposite containing 20% nCaF2cpsd possessed strong mechanical properties and excellent long-term F-release ability, and hence is promising for dental restoration applications to inhibit secondary caries.","Nano-CaF, Spray-drying, Co-precipitation, Dental composite, Fluoride release, Mechanical properties"

Moreover, the impact of additional adhesive treatment with glass-ionomer cement (GIC) was evaluated. Methods 250 intact molars were collected and randomly distributed into ten groups (n = 25). After endodontic procedure standard Class I cavities were prepared and restored with different direct restorative techniques and dentin-replacing materials. Two-group were restored with either packable or flowable short fiber-reinforced composites (SFRCs). Two-group were restored by experimental fiber-reinforced GIC with and without adhesive treatment. Four-group were restored by conventional and resin-modified GICs with or without adhesive treatment. One-group was restored with a dual-cure composite resin and last group was restored with only conventional composite resin (control). Fatigue-survival was measured for all specimens using a cyclic-loading machine until fracture occurred or a number of 40.000 cycles were achieved. Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis was conducted, followed by pairwise log-rank post hoc comparisons. Fracture mode was then examined by means of optical microscopy and SEM. Results Group restored with flowable SFRC showed significantly higher survival (p < 0.05) compared to all of the groups, except for group restored with packable SFRC (p > 0.05). Group restored with fiber-reinforced GIC had significantly (p < 0.05) higher survival rates compared to other commercial GICs. SEM demonstrated change of the fracture line when fracture reached the SFRC layer. Significance Direct restoration of Class I in ET molars with the use of SFRCs as dentin-replacing materials demonstrated its ability to reinforce the dental structures and to increase the fatigue resistance in this specific clinical situation.","Fatigue survival, Fiber-reinforced glass ionomer cement, Short fiber-reinforced composite, Root canal treated molar teeth, Occlusal cavity"

In a second step, the specimens were either treated with argon-oxygen plasma, air plasma, enzymatic cleaning agent or did not undergo an additional cleaning process. Uncontaminated zirconia specimens were used as the control group. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used for chemical analysis of the bonding surfaces of specimens. Plexiglas tubes filled with composite resin were bonded to zirconia specimens with a phosphate monomer containing luting resin. Tensile bond strength (TBS) was tested after 3 days or 150 days water storage with 37,500 thermal cycles. Results XPS revealed a decrease of the carbon/oxygen ratio after plasma treatment and an increase after treatment with an enzymatic cleaning agent in all groups. All contaminated specimens showed high and durable TBS after cleaning with a combination of isopropanol and a non-thermal atmospheric plasma. After the cleaning with enzymatic cleaning agent the TBS was significantly reduced in all groups after 150 days thermal cycling.

A secondary objective was to correlate results with developed interfacial area ratio (Sdr) and surface wettability. Methods Experimental PICN and DF blocks were cut into equilateral half-prisms, which were treated with HF or AB, then treated with an experimental silane or not and bonded to their counterparts with an experimental light-cure resin cement. After thermocycling, samples (n=30 per group) were tested for IFT using the notchless triangular prism test in a water bath at 36°C. Moreover, profilometry and contact angle measurement were performed on rectangular samples of each group. Finally, bonding interface was analysed by SEM. Results PICN-HF treated with silane showed the highest IFT significantly. Three-way ANOVA revealed the influence of silane, material class and surface pre-treatment (HF or AB) on IFT (p<0.05). When silane was used, IFT was correlated with Sdr, while surface wettability was increased. Silane application significantly increased IFT for PICN but not for DF, while PICN performed better with HF and DF with AB. Significance Silane increases IFT of composite cement with PICNs, but not with DF materials. Results suggest that silane increases the micromechanical bond by promoting resin cement spreading and penetration in surface roughness. This roughness is significantly higher for pre-treated PICNs than for DF due to their specific honeycomb microstructure when etched, which explains their better bonding properties.","Dental materials, Prosthetic dentistry, Dental prosthesis retention, Polymer-infiltrated ceramic network, Composite cement, High-temperature high-pressure polymerization, Fracture mechanics, Notchless triangular prism test, Surface roughness, Biomaterials"

The nt-TiO2 were mixed with a triazine-methacrylate monomer (TAT) to formulate nt-TiO2:TAT, which were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The nt-TiO2, TAT, and nt-TiO2:TAT were evaluated via Fourier Transform Infrared, Ultraviolet–visible, and micro-Raman spectroscopies. An experimental adhesive resin was formulated with bisphenol A glycerolate dimethacrylates, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and photoinitiator/co-initiator system. nt-TiO2 or nt-TiO2:TAT were incorporated at 2.5 wt.% and 5 wt.% in the adhesive.

Results TEM confirmed the nanotubular morphology of TiO2. FTIR, UV–vis, and micro-Raman analyses showed the characteristic peaks of each material, indicating the impregnation of TAT in the nt-TiO2. Adhesives with nt-TiO2:TAT showed antimicrobial activity against biofilm formation compared to control (p < 0.05), without differences in the viability of planktonic bacteria (p > 0.05). All groups showed high percentages of pulp cell viability. The polymerization kinetics varied among groups, but all presented DC above 50%.

This current review provides a critical analysis of the existing literature, particularly focusing on BAGs prepared via the melt-quench route that form an “apatite-like” phase when immersed in physiological-like solutions. Methods Online databases (Science Direct, PubMed and Google Scholar) were used to collect data published from 1962 to 2020. The research papers were analyzed and the relevant papers were selected for this review. Sol–gel BAGs were not included in this review since it is not a cost-effective manufacturing technique that can be upscaled and is difficult to incorporate fluoride. Results BAGs release Ca2+, PO43− and F− ions, raise the pH and form apatite. There are numerous published papers on the bioactivity of BAGs, but the different glass compositions, volume fractions, particle sizes, immersion media, time points, and the characterization techniques used, make comparison difficult. Several papers only use certain characterization techniques that do not provide a full picture of the behavior of the glass. It was noted that in most studies, mechanical properties were measured on dry samples, which does not replicate the conditions in the oral environment. Therefore, it is recommended that samples should be immersed for longer time periods in physiological solutions to mimic clinical environments.

Therefore, this study aimed to quantify BPA present as an impurity in both BPA-based and non-BPA-based monomers and to evaluate whether these monomers may degrade to BPA upon salivary, bacterial, and chemical challenges. Methods BPA was determined in three different amounts (1, 2, and 3 μmol) of each monomer (TEGDMA, UDMA, mUDMA, BisGMA, BisEMA-3, -6, -10, -30, BisPMA, EBPADMA urethane, BADGE, and BisDMA). Next, the monomers (3 μmol) were immersed in whole human pooled saliva collected from adults, Streptococcus mutans (2 × 107 CFU/mL), and acidic (0.1 M HCl), alkaline (0.1 M NaOH), and control media. The amount of BPA was quantified using a specific and highly sensitive UPLC–MS/MS method including derivatization of BPA by pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride. Results The monomers BisGMA and BisEMA-3 contained trace amounts (0.0006% and 0.0025%, respectively) of BPA as impurities of their synthesis process. BPA concentrations increased when the monomers BisGMA, BisEMA-3, BisEMA-6, BisEMA-10, BisPMA and BADGE were exposed to saliva and S. mutans, indicating degradation of a small amount of monomer into BPA. In addition, BisPMA and BADGE degraded into BPA under alkaline conditions. The conversion rate of the monomers into BPA ranged between 0.0003% and 0.0025%. Significance Impurities and degradation of BPA-based monomers may account for the release of BPA from resin-based dental materials. Even though the detected amounts of BPA due to monomer impurity were small, manufacturers of dental materials can reduce the BPA content by using only monomers of the highest purity. Considering the overall current trend towards BPA-free materials, it may be recommendable to investigate whether non-BPA based monomers can be used in dental resin-based materials.","Bisphenol A, Dental monomer, Impurity, Degradation"

Herein we review past and current work to understand these challenges and approaches to improve dental materials and extend restoration service life. Methods Peer-reviewed work from a number of researchers as well as our own are summarized and analyzed. We also include yet-unpublished work of our own. Challenges to dental materials, methods to assess new materials, and recent material improvements and research directions are presented. Results Mechanical stress, host- and bacterial-biodegradation, and secondary caries formation all contribute to restoration failure. In particular, several host- and bacterial-derived enzymes degrade the resin and collagen components of the hybrid layer, expanding the marginal gap and increasing access to bacteria and saliva. Furthermore, the virulence of cariogenic bacteria is up-regulated by resin biodegradation by-products, creating a positive feedback loop that increases biodegradation. These factors work synergistically to degrade the restoration margin, leading to secondary caries and restoration failure. Significant progress has been made to produce hydrolytically stable resins to resist biodegradation, as well as antimicrobial materials to reduce bacterial load around the restoration. Ideally, these two approaches should be combined in a holistic approach to restoration preservation.

Methods Composite samples of ceram.x® universal, Filtek™ Supreme XTE, and Admira® Fusion were stored 72h in cell culture medium to prepare eluates, according to ISO 10993-12:2012. Human gingival keratinocytes were exposed to these eluates with or without 3mM N-Acetylcysteine. Following cell observation by iCELLigence®, exposure periods were determined at 1d and 4d. Cell morphological analysis combined with live/dead staining was performed. Tissue-specific biomarkers of terminal differentiation, Involucrin and Filaggrin, were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and Western blot (WB). qPCR profiling was performed on genes encoding for: inflammation, apoptosis, turn-over of extracellular matrix, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. For statistical analysis one-way Anova was used (p<0.05). Results Cells exposed to N-Acetylcysteine exhibited morphological changes but no cell death. After adding 3mM N-Acetylcysteine to HGK cultures, increased fluorescence intensity and protein amounts of Involucrin and Filaggrin indicated enhanced differentiation (p<0.05). Gene expression was modulated by: (i) composition of the composite eluates, (ii) NAC and (iii) exposure time. Filtek™ Supreme XTE showed a significant increased gene expression in inflammatory genes (p<0.05), which was amplified by the addition of NAC at 1d. Concerning exposure time, modulated gene expression showed eluate dependency, substantiated by Filtek™ Supreme XTE modulation at day 1 and Admira® Fusion at day 4. Significance N-Acetylcysteine-emerging effects on gingival keratinocytes were threefold: (i) increase of differentiation, (ii) modulation of composite-related effects and (iii) in parts counteraction of eluate-induced effects.","Composite materials, Antioxidant, -Acetylcysteine, Human gingival keratinocytes"

Methods Nanocomposite was fabricated using dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM), 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP). Biofilms with 1, 3, 6 and 9 species of periodontal pathogens were grown on the composites and tested for live/dead staining, colony-forming units (CFU), metabolic activity, and biofilm matrix polysaccharide production. Results The bioactive composite reduced protein adsorption by an order of magnitude (p < 0.05) and greatly reduced biofilm viability. It decreased the biofilm CFU by more than 3 orders of magnitude for all four types of periodontal biofilms, compared to control composite. With increasing the biofilm species from 1 to 9, the antibacterial efficacy of DMAHDM composite decreased; the CFU reduction folds decreased from 947 folds to 44 folds. In contrast, the MPC + DMAHDM composite maintained a CFU reduction folds of greater than 3000, showing a similar antibacterial potency from 1 to 9 species in the biofilms (p > 0.1). Conclusion Dual agents MPC + DMAHDM achieved the greatest inhibition in biofilm, without decreasing its antibacterial potency when the biofilm species was increased from 1 to 9. A single agent became less effective when the biofilm species was increased from 1 to 9. Significance The multifunctional MPC + DMAHDM composite is promising for root caries treatment and Class V restorations with subgingival margins to effectively inhibit multispecies periodontal biofilms, combat periodontitis and protect the periodontium.","Dental composite, Root caries, Protein-repellent, Antibacterial, Surface roughness, Periodontal biofilm"

Furthermore, it was to be investigated whether the different composites of the Tetric® RBC product family release different types and amounts of substances. Methods Four different composite materials from the Tetric® product family were studied. For each material subgroup ten human third molar teeth were prepared with standard Class-I occlusal cavities. These ‘tooth group’ specimens were provided with a three-step adhesive system (incorporating TEGDMA) and the respective composite restoration. Same sized control specimens, of each RBC restorative material, were prepared (‘direct RBC’ groups). All specimens were placed in individual elution chambers such that the elution media (ethanol/water, 3:1) only came into contact with either the tooth root or ¾ height of the ‘direct RBC’ materials. They were incubated at 37 °C for up to 7 d. Samples of the eluant were taken after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d and were analysed by high-temperature gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results Bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate (bisEMA), bisphenol A glycidyldimethacrylate (bisGMA), tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEEGDMA), decan-1,10-diol dimethacrylate (DDDMA) were mostly found in the eluates of the ‘direct RBC’ groups in statistically significantly greater amounts than in the eluates of the ‘tooth groups’. Such quantitative differences were also the case with eluates containing bisphenol A (BPA), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) and drometrizole, which are common in the environment. In contrast to the behavior found with all the other monomers, up to 3 orders of magnitude more triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was found in the ‘tooth groups’ compared to the ‘direct RBC’ groups, evidently released by the adhesive system. Significance The release of most of the substances was clearly delayed in the ‘tooth groups’ indicative of their chronic, rather than acute, elution to the oral environment. A barrier function of the residual dentin layer and the adhesion layer can be inferred. The different release patterns of substances from the various composites of the RBC product family is a manifestation of their different and indication-specific compositions. Consideration of an overall restorative care (RBC plus adhesive) system, when assessing the total amount of released substances, is emphasized.","GC/MS, BisEMA, Bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate, Dicyclohexyl phthalate, Drometrizole, Tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, Decan-1,10-diol dimethacrylate, Dentin barrier, Dentinal tubules, Elution"

In addition, pure polycarbonate and dense alumina specimens were subjected to the same characterisation namely: density, compression, three-point bend, hardness, surface loss and surface roughness testing. Scanning electron microscopy and micro computerised tomography were employed for structural examination. Results Three-dimensional aligned honeycomb-like ceramic structures were produced and full interpenetration of the polymer phase was observed using MicroCT.

Composite specimens showed characteristic properties part way between enamel and polycarbonate. Significance There was a correlation between the initial solid ceramic loading in the aqueous suspension, used to produce the porous ceramic scaffolds, and the subsequent characteristic properties of the composite materials. These novel composites show potential as aesthetic orthodontic bracket materials, as their properties fit part way between those of ceramic, enamel and polycarbonate.",

Material and methods Specimens of Nextdent SG, Freeprint Splint, Fotodent Guide, 3Delta Guide, and V-print SG (n = 4) were additively manufactured with the corresponding DLP/SLA printing devices (Rapidshape D20II, Form2, Solflex350). Postprocessing was done according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Subsequently, samples were eluted in methanol and water for 3 days and analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results A total of twelve different substances released from the tested resin materials. The highest eluted concentration for MMA in methanol was 20.27 ± 8.60 μg/mL followed by 12.66 ± 3.38 μg/mL of HPMA. HEMA was found at concentration of 11.17 ± 2.43 μg/mL in methanol and 1.15 ± 0.11 μg/mL in water. TPGDA and TEGDMA reached maximum concentration in methanol of 4.29 ± 0.54 μg/mL and 5.07 ± 0.93 μg/mL and in water of 0.79 ± 0.19 μg/mL and 0.36 ± 0.14 μg/mL, respectively. Significant difference was found for the material Nextdent SG manufactured on SLA and DLP printing device for THFMA (p = 0.041), TEGDMA (p = 0.026), TPGDA (p = 0.05) and EGDMA (p = 0.06). The amount of monomers released into water did not reach the detection threshold for V-print SG. Significance The study revealed significant influence of the printing technique and resin material on the elution of monomers. The elution in methanol and water was significantly different. While the relative amount of eluted monomers from 3D printed guides is comparable to conventional direct composites and below toxic relevant concentrations, the absolute amount of monomer can rise in a clinic situation due to the size of the guides.","Elution, 3D printing, Monomers, Surgical guide, Methacrylates, HPLC"

This study investigates degradation of two resin-composites in relation with biofilm composition in vitro and in vivo. Methods Surface-chemical-composition of two Bis-GMA/TEGDMA composites was compared using X-ray-Photoelectron-Spectroscopy from which the number ester-linkages was derived. Composite-degradation was assessed through water contact angles, yielding surface-exposure of filler-particles. Degradation in vitro was achieved by composite immersion in a lipase solution. In order to evaluate in vivo degradation, composite samples were worn in palatal devices by 15 volunteers for 30-days periods in absence and presence of manually-brushing with water. PCR-DGGE analysis was applied to determine biofilm composition on the samples, while in addition to water contact angles, degradation of worn composites was assessed through surface-roughness and micro-hardness measurements. Results In vitro degradation by lipase exposure was highest for the high ester-linkage composite and virtually absent for the low ester-linkage composite. Filler-particle surface-exposure, surface-roughness and micro-hardness of both resin-composites increased during intra-oral wear, but filler-particle surface-exposure was affected most. However, based on increased filler-particle surface-exposure, the high ester-linkage composite degraded most in volunteers harvesting composite biofilms comprising Streptococcus mutans, a known esterase and lactic acid producer. This occurred especially in absence of brushing. Significance Degradation during intra-oral wear of a low ester-linkage composite was smaller than of a high ester-linkage composite, amongst possible other differences between both composites.

It was the main aim of the present study to determine if bisEMA can reach the dental pulp by generally passive diffusion through the coronal dentinal tubules stimulated via eluent liquids surrounding the root structures only. Methods In 20 human third molar teeth, standard Class-I occlusal cavities were prepared and provided either with an adhesive system alone or additionally with a composite restoration, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The teeth were placed in an elution chamber such that the elution media only came into contact with the tooth root/tooth base where they were incubated at 37 °C for up to 7 d. Samples were taken after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to identify bisEMA and other monomers in ethanol/water (3:1) and aqueous eluates. Results bisEMA was only found in ethanol/water eluates, where the teeth had received a composite restoration. Traces of bisEMA with up to three ethylene oxide units could be detected in these eluates. Depending on the dentin thickness, different elution kinetics of bisEMA were determined. Regardless of the treatment of teeth, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) and tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEEGDMA) were found in ethanolic/aqueous eluates in equal amounts. Most TEGDMA and TEEGDMA diffused through the dentin within the first 24 h. Significance Depending on the dentin layer thickness, bisEMA was released for varied time periods, resulting in varied concentrations and exposure times for the different cells of the dental pulp. The concentrations of TEGDMA and TEEGDMA were greatest for cells of the dental pulp within the first 24 h.","GC/MS, bisEMA, Bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate, Dentin barrier, Dentinal tubules, Elution, Diffusion kinetics"

Methods BisGMA/TEGDMA-based dual-cured cement was formulated with 1.0 wt% DHEPT and 0.75 wt% BPO as initiators and used as control. The concentration of BPO was adjusted to 0.1 wt% in catalyst paste of experimental cements, and two base pastes containing TU and 0.5 wt% or 0.25 wt% of DHEPT were formulated. The rheological behavior and kinetics of polymerization of cements were assessed in the absence of light activation. The kinetics of polymerization was also evaluated for cements light-activated immediately or 5 min after the start of mixing. Polymerization stress, flexural strength and elastic modulus (n = 5) were also evaluated under these conditions. Results Cements with TU presented lower viscosity than the control, improved working time (0.25% DHEPT > 0.5% DHEPT) and higher conversion in the absence of light-activation. Delaying the light-activation reduced the maximum rate of polymerization (Rpmax) but did not affect the conversion or stress. The addition of TU increased the Rpmax and conversion, and reduced the stress when compared to the control, without affecting the flexural strength. Except for the control with delayed light-activation (highest values), the other experimental conditions yielded similar modulus. Significance Adding TU and using a low concentration of DHEPT/BPO resulted in dual-cured cements with longer working time, reduced polymerization stress and increased conversion even in the absence of light, with no significant effect on the mechanical properties.","Dual-cure, Pre-polymerized additives, Polymerization stress, Resin cement"

In vitro studies evaluating the effects of surface conditioning on the bond strength of ICs were selected. The meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the mean difference between surface-conditioned ICs and unconditioned controls. Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the different surface conditioning methods, separately for polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material and the ICs with dispersed fillers (ICDFs). Meta-analyses were performed with a random-effects model at a significance level of 0.05. Results and Significance From 802 relevant studies, 25 were selected for full-text analysis. Nineteen studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review, whereas 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis. A manual search of the principal periodicals specific to the area resulted in no additional articles. The meta-analysis indicated a significant difference in bond strength between the surface-conditioned ICs and controls under both non-aged and aged conditions. The combination of mechanical and chemical conditioning yielded the highest bond strength of ICs. This meta-analysis suggests that chemical etching followed by a universal primer and alumina air abrasion followed by a silane coupling agent could be considered the best strategy for optimizing the bond strength of PICN materials and ICDFs under aged conditions, respectively.","Bonding, Composite resin, Indirect composite block"

For that it was used a BisGMA/TEGDMA matrix and added low concentration of MMT/CHX. The aim was to evaluate the drug release capacity of MMT, and not to provide reinforcement. Methods Six experimental composites were made with organic matrix of BisGMA/TEGDMA in equal proportions by weight. The composites received organophlizated montmorillonite with or without CHX. The concentrations were 2,5; 5 or 10% by weight. Degree of conversion (DC) was evaluated using FTIR (peak 6165 cm-1; n=5). Specimens for flexural properties (10×2×1mm) were immediate tested (24h). Elastic modulus(E) and flexural strength (FS) was measured using the three point bending test (n=10). Inibition halo was used to test the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (n=5 for each bacteria). The inhibition of biofilm formation (BF) was evaluated by inserting polymerized disc of composite in to a culture media colonized with Streptococcus mutans (n=10).

The data of degree of conversion was analysed using Kruskal–Wallis/ Mann–Whitney, and the other variables using two-way ANOVA/Tukey, always considering a global level of significance of 5%. Results DC ranged from 71% to 74%. E ranged from 5.7 to 8.1GPa. FS ranged from 61.4 to 74.7MPa. There were no statistical differences among the groups for all the variables. For the three bacteria tested the composites with CHX loaded presented inhibition of growth for all concentration, except for 2,5% that did not inihibited the growth of P. gingivalis. BF was lower for the groups with 10% MMT/CHX, all groups presented BF, even those without CHX loaded. All concentrations presented release off CHX during all the 28 days analyzed. Conclusions Within the limitation of this study it can be concluded that: all concentrations tested presented release of CHX and reduced BF. All concentration presented antibacterial activity for the three bacteria tested, except for 2,5% that did not inhibit the growth of P. gingivalis.

Objective The objectives of the present study were to develop experimental composite resins with chitosan or chitosan loaded with dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA) particles and to demonstrate their antimicrobial potential without loss of mechanical properties or biocompatibility. Methods Chitosan and chitosan/DCPA particles were synthetized by the electrospray method. Experimental composites were formulated by adding 0, 0.5, or 1.0 wt% particles into a resin matrix along with 60 wt% barium glass. The degree of conversion and mechanical properties were measured after 1 and 90 days of aging in water after photoactivation. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated using fibroblasts from dental pulp in conditioned medium. The antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans was assessed by crystal violet biofilm assay. Results The experimental restorative composites were not found to be cytotoxic or genotoxic, with cell viability of 93.1 ± 8.0% (p = 0.328) and 3.0 ± 0.8% micronucleus per group (p = 0.1078), respectively. The antimicrobial results showed that all composites with approximately 20% less biofilm (p < 0.001) relative to the control. No chitosan release was detected from the composites, suggesting direct contact of the bacteria with exposed chitosan particles on the surface was responsible for the observed antimicrobial effect. The addition of the chitosan and chitosan/DCPA submicrometer (<250 nm average diameter) particles to restorative composites did not change the degree of conversion, flexural strength, elastic modulus and fracture toughness compared to the control group after 90 days aging in water.

Thus, designing a dentine bonding system (DBS) with an intrinsically antimicrobial polymerisable monomer is of significance especially if it can be used with self-etching primers enabling resistance to degradation of the interface. Methods Experimental adhesives were developed incorporating eugenyl methacrylate (EgMA) at concentrations of 0,10 or 20 wt%, designated as EgMA0, EgMA10 and EgMA20, respectively, for use as a two-step self-etch DBS with the functional monomer bis[2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] phosphate (BMEP) in the primer. The curing, thermal and wettability properties of the adhesives were determined, and hybrid layer formation was characterised by confocal laser scanning microscopy, microtensile bond strengths (µTBS) and nanoleakage by back-scattered SEM. In situ zymography was used to assess MMP inhibitory activity of the BMEP-EgMA DBS. Results EgMA in the adhesives lowered the polymerisation exotherm and resulted in higher Tg, without negatively affecting degree of conversion. Water sorption and solubility were significantly lower with higher concentrations of EgMA in the adhesive. The formation of a distinct hybrid layer was evident from confocal images with the different adhesives, whilst EgMA20 yielded the highest µTBS post water storage challenges and lowest nanoleakage after 6 months. The experimental DBS exhibited minimal to no MMP activity at 3 months. Significance The hydrophobic nature of EgMA and high cross-link density exerts considerable benefits in lowering water uptake and polymerisation exotherm. The application of EgMA, adhesives in conjunction with BMEP in a multi-functional self-etching DBS can resist MMP activity, hence, enhance longevity of the dentine-resin composite interface.","Dental adhesives, Antibacterial agents, Eugenol, Functional monomers, Dentine bonding"

This study aims to evaluate the initial biocompatibility of novel printable resins for manufacturing temporary and permanent FDP. Methods Specimens of five printable resins (VarseoSmile Crown plus, NextDent C&B MFH, VarseoSmile Temp, Temp PRINT, P Pro Crown & Bridge), two types of resins for subtractive manufacturing (Tetric CAD, Telio CAD) and two types of resins with conventional curing processes (Tetric EvoCeram, Protemp 4) were produced and finished. Post-processing was strictly performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Biocompatibility was evaluated by eluting specimens with cell culture medium and treating human gingival fibroblast cells with the eluates. A 72-hour continuous read cell viability assay measuring the reducing potential of the cells was performed. The cellular inflammatory response in terms of IL-6 and PGE2 levels was determined with specific ELISAs. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring oxidized glutathione concentrations after exposure to the resin eluates. A luminescence-based apoptosis assay was used to detect apoptosis. Results Tetric CAD and Telio CAD were slightly toxic. All other resins were moderately to severely cytotoxic. VarseoSmile Crown plus and P Pro Crown & Bridge significantly enhanced PGE2 levels. Higher concentrations of oxidized gluthatione were determined in the presence of Telio CAD, VarseoSmile Temp and P Pro Crown & Bridge. Tetric EvoCeram and Protemp 4 reduced intracellular gluthatione levels. All printable resins slightly induced apoptosis. Significance Further post-processing steps such as additional curing and washing may improve the biocompatibility of printable materials.","CAD/CAM, 3D printing, Apoptosis, Oxidative stress, Inflammatory response, Cell viability"

The objective of this study was to modify experimental resin cements (ERCs) with diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate (DPI) in an attempt to improve chemical and mechanical properties of materials cured with reduced irradiance and final radiant exposure. Methods A co-monomer base containing a 1:1 mass ratio of 2.2-bis[4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxypropoxy)phenyl]propane (bis-GMA) and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was prepared, with 1mol% of camphorquinone and 2mol% of ethyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate as initiator system. The resin was divided into 4 fractions according to the DPI concentrations (0, 0.5, 1 and 2mol%). The challenging polymerization condition was simulated performing the light activation (12, 23 and 46s) through a ceramic block (3mm thick). The irradiance was assessed with a calibrated spectrometer (1320mW/cm2), resulting in three levels of radiant exposure (0.58, 1.1 and 2.2J/cm2). The polymerization kinetics was evaluated in real-time using a spectrometer (Near-IR). Water sorption and solubility was analyzed and the cohesive strength of resins obtained through the microtensile test. Polymerization stress was assessed by Bioman method. Results Resins containing DPI had higher degree of conversion and rate of polymerization than the control (without DPI). The use of DPI reduced water sorption and solubility, and led to higher cohesive strength compared to resins without the iodonium salt. However, the stress of polymerization was higher for experimental resins with DPI. Significance Even under remarkably reduced irradiance, cements containing a ternary initiating system with an iodonium salt can present an optimal degree of conversion and chemical/mechanical properties.","Degree of conversion, Irradiance, Ceramic"

Methods The effect of different DC of RBCs on human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) when cultured directly onto cured RBCs, and when exposed afterwards to eluates in cell culture medium was examined. Venus® (RBC-V; Bis-GMA-based) and Venus Pearl® (RBC-P; TCD-DI-HEA and UDMA-based) were cured using a single emission peak (blue) light, Translux Wave®; TW and a dual emission peak (blue-violet) light, Translux 2 Wave®; T2W. To determine the value of the additional violet light from the T2W, exposure times and distances were adjusted to deliver similar radiant exposures (RE) from the blue region of both lights at five different RE levels from 1.5 J/cm² to 28.9 J/cm². Results Both RBCs light-cured with the T2W at higher REs resulted in higher DC, increased cell adhesion and decreased eluate cytotoxicity. RBC-V induced greater cell adhesion, lower mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory markers, and higher mRNA levels of a proliferation marker than RBC-P. Wettability was the same for both RBCs. Toxicity decreased with increasing number of elution cycles. The initial eluates from RBC-P had a lower toxicity than from RBC-V. Significance RBCs cured with T2W (delivering both blue and violet light) at higher RE had greater DCs.

We also investigated whether UHS videography is applicable for failure-mode analysis. Methods Ten human mid-coronal dentin surfaces were bonded using Clearfil SE Bond either in self-etching (SE) or etch-and-rinse (ER) mode. After 24-h water storage, the samples were cut into beams for μTBS test and tested at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. The fracture phenomena at the bonded interface were captured using a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor digital UHS camera at 299,166 frames per second. The failure modes were classified using UHS videography, followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The failure-mode distributions determined by UHS videography and SEM analysis were statistically analyzed using Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction. Results The crack-propagation speed exceeded 1,500 km/h. No significant difference was found between the SEM and UHS videography failure-mode distributions in the SE mode. A significant difference appeared between them in the ER mode. Significant differences in the incidence of cohesive failures within the adhesive and at the adhesive–composite interface between the SE and ER modes were identified by both SEM and UHS videography. Significance UHS videography enabled visualization of the fracture dynamics at the resin– dentin interfaces under tensile load. However, the resolution at such high frame rate was insufficient to classify the failure mode as precisely as that of SEM. Nevertheless, UHS videography can provide more detailed information about the fracture origin and propagation.","Ultra-high-speed videography, Dental adhesive systems, Micro-tensile bond-strength test, Failure mode, Fractographic analysis, Crack propagation"

Methods Two types of pre-shaded zirconia materials were used: inCoris TZI C and Katana STML. A total of 120 specimens were categorised according to the milling method (dry or wet-milling) and the solution used for milling (fresh distilled water or impregnated water with residues of CAD/CAM ceramic materials). The translucency and contrast ratios of all specimens were calculated after they were subjected to sintering and accelerated ageing. The material phase composition was tested before and after ageing, using X-ray diffraction analysis to evaluate T-M phase transformation. Data were statistically analysed via a three-way analysis of variance between the subject factors, the material and milling method, and the within-subject factor, ageing. The analysis of covariance model was used to analyse the changes in translucency and contrast ratio between baseline and ageing, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results Katana STML and inCoris TZI C showed the highest translucency when dry-milled (21.9 ± 1.4, and 11.8 ± 0.7, respectively), and the lowest when milled with used impregnated water (5.4 ± 1.2 and 10.7 ± 1.3, respectively). Wet-milling using impregnated water, should be avoided owing to the saturation of alumina particles. Accelerated ageing resulted in the same pattern for both materials. Significance Dry milling of highly translucent zirconia can result in higher translucency and lower contrast ratio values.","Computer-aided design, Computer-aided manufacturing, Ceramics, Y-TZP ceramic, Digital dentistry, Optical phenomena"

Methods Radiant emittance and spectrum of eight DCUs were investigated with and without ND filters using different optical density (OD) values. Beam profiles of eight DCUs were photographed while increasing the OD values of the ND filter. The change in the beam profile while changing the f-number of the aperture and the OD value of the ND filters were recorded. The Vickers microhardness of Filtek Z350XT and SDR cured by Bluephase Style 20i with 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm specimens of nine points on each surface was measured.

Methods A 3D model of a cracked tooth was generated. We then applied eight restoration models, comprising combinations of three kinds of restoration designs (inlay, onlay, and crown) and four types of restoration materials (direct composite resin, indirect composite resin, ceramic, and gold). A 1000-N occlusal load was applied on the three reference points of the ball-shaped part in the direction of the longitudinal axis, causing crack line separation in the buccolingual direction. Stress distribution was analyzed on the occlusal surface, bottom level of the restoration, and mesiodistal longitudinal section. The stress on the lower margin of the crack surface was measured at 15 points on each model. Results Ceramic inlay and onlay showed stress concentration at the restoration bottom, and low stress on the lower margin of the crack surface. Direct and indirect resin restorations exhibited low stress on the restoration bottom, and high stress on the proximal end of the lower margin of the crack surface. With a resin-unfilled gold crown, stress was concentrated on the crown bottom and the lower margin of the crack surface. Direct resin filling inside the gold crown yielded significantly decreased stress on both areas.

Methods A convenience sample of 16 severe tooth wear patients from the Radboud Tooth Wear Project was included. Eight of them were treated with a microhybrid composite (Clearfil APX, Kuraray) and the other eight with a nanocomposite (Filtek Supreme XTE, 3M). The Direct Shaping by Occlusion (DSO) technique was used for all patients. Clinical records were collected after 1 month (baseline) as well as 1, 3 and 5 years post-treatment. The maximum height loss at specific areas per tooth was measured with Geomagic Qualify software. Intra-observer reliability was tested with paired t-tests, while multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to compare odds ratios (OR) of “large amount of wear”. Results Intra-observer reliability tests confirmed that two repeated measurements agreed well (p > 0.136). For anterior mandibular teeth, Filtek Supreme showed significantly less wear than Clearfil APX; in maxillary anterior teeth, Clearfil APX showed significantly less wear (OR material = 0.28, OR jaw position = 0.079, p < 0.001).

There is, however, scarce information regarding the subsurface damage arising from sliding contact fatigue. The aim of this study was to elucidate the wear mechanisms and the subsurface damage generated during sliding contact fatigue in 5 contemporary CAD/CAM materials against a zirconia indenter. Methods Forty discs (Ø12mm, 1.55mm thick) were cut out of IPS e.max CAD (e.CAD), Suprinity PC (SUP), Enamic (ENA), Vitablocs Mark II (VMII) and Lava Ultimate (LU) blocks and mirror polished. After cementation onto a dentin-like composite, off-axis mouth-motion cycling was conducted with a spherical zirconia indenter (r=3.18mm) in water (200N load, 2Hz frequency) for 5 different cycling periods (102, 103, 104, 105, 106 cycles, n=8). Analysis of the wear scars was conducted using light-microscopy, scanning-electron-microscopy and optical profilometry. Subsurface damage was assessed using sagittal and transverse sections of the samples. Results Fatigue wear mechanisms predominated in glassy materials (e.CAD, SUP, VMII), accompanied by extensive subsurface damage, whereas abrasive wear mechanisms were responsible for the large wear craters in the resin composite (LU) with an absolute absence of subsurface fracture. A combination of both mechanisms was observed in the polymer-infiltrated reinforced-glass (ENA), displaying large wear craters and severe subsurface damage.

When used as ion-releasing fillers in resin-based materials, they could contribute to extend the service life of adhesive restorations, remineralize caries-affected dentin or prevent caries lesions under sealants and orthodontic brackets. However, the development of resin-based bioactive materials is not straightforward because of the several compositional variables involved in ion release. Also, CaP particles do not reinforce the material; therefore, if high mechanical properties are required, the ratio between CaP particles and reinforcing fillers must be observed. Several research groups have investigated how CaP phase, particle size and content, as well as resin matrix formulation affect remineralization, ion release kinetics and mechanical properties of these materials.

In many cases, prosthetic rehabilitation of the damaged teeth is mandatory. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate, for the first time on this scale, the resistance of various commonly used self-adhesive resin luting cements (Bifix SE, VOCO; G-Cem LinkAce, GC; RelyX Unicem, 3 M Oral Care; SpeedCEM Plus, Ivoclar ) against acidic media, and to find out whether they can withstand long-term exposure. These results were compared with an adhesive resin luting cement (Panavia V5, Kuraray) that functioned as reference gold standard. Furthermore we applied area roughness parameters for surface texture analysis in the present investigation, to highlight their advantages for investigations on the surface quality of resin luting cements. Methods Six specimens with identical diameter (10 mm) and thickness (3 mm) were prepared from each self-adhesive and adhesive resin luting cement and forwarded to an incubation in various acidic media for a period of 232 h. Conductivity and pH-values of each acidic medium was analyzed for each material group prior (t 0) and after exposure (t 1). The specimens were examined for Vickers microhardness and surface quality. For the evaluation of surface roughness, the parameters Sa, Sdr, Spc Spk, Sk, and Svk were investigated by using different filtered surfaces (S-L; S-F) according to ISO 25 178. Statistical analysis was conducted at a significance level of α = 0.050. Results For the evaluation of the acid resistance of self-adhesive resin luting cements investigations on conductivity and pH-value assessment of storage solution appear unsuitable, while the assessment of microhardness and surface analysis revealed valid data. It could be shown that changes in surface texture of the resin luting cements can be determinend in qualitative and quantitative manner. While the microhardness and surface quality of some resin luting cements hardly changed, others showed significantly reduced values in microhardness and changes in their surface quality (p < 0.001).

Methods Disk specimens, of 1and 2 mm thickness (n = 3), were prepared from five CAD/CAM and six resin-based composites (RBCs). The CAD/CAM resin-composites included aesthetic types: CeraSmart (CS), Grandio Blocs (GB), Lava Ultimate (LU), plus a polymer infiltrated ceramic Vita Enamic (VE), and a feldspathic ceramic Vita Mark II (VM II). The six RBCs were for different clinical applications: direct filling, flowable, bulk fill, base and two luting cements. The specimens were radiographed alongside an aluminium step wedge and a tooth section. Digital images were analysed, and the radiopacity of each specimen was determined according to ISO 1311/2014. Statistical analyses of radiopacity, expressed as mm Al (n = 15), were carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by pairwise comparisons (α = 0.05). Results Radiopacities of CAD/CAM materials were, in ascending order, VE, VM II, CS, LU, and GB. At 1 mm thickness, the radiopacities of all CAD/CAM specimens were matching or slightly lower than enamel. At 2-mm thickness, the resin composite blocks were significantly more radiopaque than the ceramics VE and VM II (p < 0.0001). No statistically significant differences in radiopacity were detected between the 1-mm thick infiltrated ceramic, enamel, dentin and various resin composites except for filling and bulk fill types. The radiopacity of polymer-infiltrated ceramics was low despite the presence of radiopacifying elements and high filler content. Significance Identifying thin restorations in standard radiographs is necessary with the development and expanded application of ‘digital’ dental materials in restorative treatment. This study confirmed the joint influence of composition and thickness on radiopacity. CAD/CAM restorative materials showed thickness-dependant radiopacity. But polymer-infiltrated ceramics were fairly radiolucent. There is a need to revisit radiopacity requirements for CAD/CAM restorative materials.","CAD/CAM, Resin composite, Polymer-infiltrated ceramic, Radiopacity, Digital radiography"

The current study investigates the toughening effects during the path of a preexisting crack propagating through the bilayer system as it confronts the interface, through the attempted alignment of fibers and matrix-fiber interactions in the SFRC, and the distance it travels in the SFRC. Methods Bilayer systems of SFRC and conventional composite were produced with aligned fibers perpendicular to load direction. Single-edge-notched bend (SENB) specimens (25 × 5 × 2.5 mm3) with pre-crack length (a) to width (W) ratios (a/W = 0.2−0.8) were produced and tested in 3-point bending configuration until complete fracture. The specific work of fracture (we) was deduced from calculating the area under the load-displacement curves. Fiber alignment was digitally evaluated from images taken from the top and side planes of the specimen. Results The toughness of the bilayer system is optimal when maximum SFRC thickness is used. EWF methods showed toughness and increasing nonessential work of fracture scaling with ligament length. A longer distance is accompanied by a higher distribution of aligned fibers bridging behind the crack wake, reducing crack driving forces at the crack tip. Significance SFRC materials provide increasing toughening potential with increasing thickness, and have the ability to be more anisotropic than other composite materials. Clinically, the layer must have a conventional composite cover layer, but which thickness does not affect toughness potential. Therefore the thickness of the conventional composite can be dictated by wear behavior.","Essential work of fracture, Glass fiber, Dental, Resin composite, Restorative materials"
