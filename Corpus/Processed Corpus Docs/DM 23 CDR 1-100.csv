Ceramic additive manufacturing (AM) technology has emerged as a promising solution that offers advantages over traditional techniques such as injection molding, die pressing, tape casting, and milling. Ceramic AM is, however, still under development, with new technologies and devices continuously emerging. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest research and applications of ceramic AM in dental restoration, focusing on the progress made within the past five years. Three perspectives are discussed: ceramic AM technologies, commonly used printable ceramic materials, and different types of dental restorations. Among these, vat photopolymerization is the most widely researched and promising AM technology for large-scale applications. ZrO2 remains the primary material used in AM research, whereas crowns and bridges are the most frequently studied and are the closest to industrialized dental restorations. Currently, ceramic AM satisfies the clinical requirements of accuracy, mechanical performance, and biocompatibility. However, compared with traditional methods, it lacks significant advantages in terms of cost and manufacturing efficiency, limiting its large-scale application. Further improvements are necessary in all stages, including raw materials, equipment, post-processing, and standardization.","Additive manufacture, Ceramic, Dental restoration, Forming accuracy, Mechanical performance"

The incorporation of graphene into concrete can address issues such as brittleness, low tensile strength, and permeability. Graphene offers great potential as a concrete additive because of its remarkable features such as efficient heat and electrical conductivity, as well as remarkable strength. Several forms of graphene such as graphene oxide (GO), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and functionalized graphene (FG), have been tested, and all have shown improvements in compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). The two-dimensional nature of graphene allows it to have a high specific surface area, making it an attractive construction and building material. The use of graphene in concrete can help lower global CO2 emissions, making the construction industry more sustainable. The incorporation of a very small quantity of graphene can increase the strength of conventional concrete, reducing the environmental footprint. The article discusses the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) study, which indicates that making 1 kg of commercial GNPs resulted in lower CO2 emissions than OPC. The adoption of graphene as a 21st-century material grew extensively in many applications such as computing, energy, medicine, optics, and material science, and now it can be used to improve the concrete's mechanical and durability capabilities.","Graphene, Concrete, Cementitious binder, Mechanical strength, Durability, CO emissions, Ordinary Portland cement, OPC"

Bone loss, fractures, and joint degeneration are common problems that can result from a variety of pathological conditions, and their restoration and replacement are essential not only for functional purposes but also for improving the quality of life for patients. However, current methods rely heavily on artificial materials that can potentially lead to further tissue damage, making tissue engineering a highly attractive alternative. This innovative approach involves the utilization of stem cells (SCs), which are seeded onto a scaffold to form a biological complex. Among these SCs, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) extracted from bone marrow and adipose tissue have shown immense potential for bone and joint tissue regeneration. The success of orthopedic tissue engineering is contingent on the careful selection of appropriate scaffolds and inducing molecules, which play a critical role in carrying and supporting cells and inducing their differentiation. This review article comprehensively analyzes the three vital aspects of orthopedic tissue engineering - SCs, scaffolds, and inducing molecules - in order to provide a deeper understanding of this emerging field and its potential for the future of orthopedic medicine.","Stem cells, Functional restoration, Bone loss, Fractures, Emerging field, Orthopedic medicine"

FBC fly ash however exhibits different characteristics (i.e. morphology and chemical and phase compositions) to PCC fly ash. This review aims to overview the generic features of PCC and FBC processes that contribute to their unique product characteristics. The review then discusses and summarises the important characteristics of FBC fly ash and the reported variations in the literatures due to the different coal types and origins, which determine their binding application suitability. Comprehensive discussions are then made on the requirements, mechanisms, and product properties of the four most widely studied routes of using FBC fly ash as binder material, i.e. (i) adding Portland cement to form blended Portland cement; (ii) adding bauxite to form calcium sulphoaluminate cement; (iii) adding granulated blast furnace slag to form supersulphated cement; and (iv) adding alkali activator to form alkali-activated binder. Despite the vast potential of FBC fly ash, there are two key challenges, i.e. (i) lack of standard specification that caters specifically to various FBC fly ashes and (ii) high variation in the final cured product properties.

Successful application of this approach avoids the need for further and more extensive treatment. In order to ensure a complete pulp healing with the placement of restorative materials, a mineralized tissue barrier must form to protect the pulp from microbial invasion. The formation of mineralized tissue barrier can only be induced when there is a significant reduction in pulp inflammation and infection. Consequently, promoting the healing of pulp inflammation may provide a favorable therapeutic opportunity to maintain the sustainability of DPC treatment. Mineralized tissue formation was observed as the favorable reaction of exposed pulp tissue against a variety of dental biomaterials utilized for DPC. This observation reveals an intrinsic capacity of pulp tissue for healing. Therefore, this review focuses on the DPC and its healing procedure as well as the materials used for DPC treatment and their mechanisms of action to promote pulpal healing. In addition, the factors that can affect the healing process of DPC, clinical considerations and future perspective has been described.","Vital pulp therapy, Direct pulp capping, Calcium hydroxide, Mineral trioxide aggregate, Bioceramics, Pulp capping materials"

It is valuable for smart structures. It is mainly achieved by measuring the electrical resistance of the structural material, as the resistance is affected by strain and damage. Electrical-resistance-based strain/damage self-sensing in cement-based materials emerged in 1993 and the field has grown greatly since then. This is a critical review of this field. Elastic strain causes reversible resistivity change. Damage causes irreversible resistivity increase. Conductive admixtures are required. For short carbon fiber as admixture, the resistivity decreases upon compression, due to the fiber-matrix interfacial resistivity decrease, and increases upon tension; upon flexure, the compression surface resistance decreases and tension surface resistance increases. As shown by the gage factor, carbon fiber/nanofiber/nanotube is more effective than carbon-black/graphite-nanoplatelet/graphene, and short carbon fiber is more effective than carbon nanotube. The addition of carbon nanotube to short carbon fiber decreases the gage factor. For nanotube/nanofiber, the resistivity decreases upon compression, due to increased contact among the nanotube/nanofiber units. The sensing performance is best when the admixture volume fraction is near the percolation threshold. Silica fume and surfactants in the cement mix promote the admixture dispersion. Sonication for promoting the nanocarbon dispersion is not necessary for the fiber dispersion. Nanofiber/nanotube deposition on fine aggregate enhances the dispersion. Macroscale steel fibers are less effective than microscale ones, which are less effective than carbon fiber. Common experimental method pitfalls are also addressed. The four-probe method is much more reliable than the two-probe method.","Carbon fiber, Carbon nanotube, Cement, Electrical resistance, Strain sensing, Damage sensing"

This review examines the contamination of estuaries on the continent with metals, persistent organic pollutants, and solid wastes, as well as their accumulation and transference through the trophic web. Moreover, we emphasize that the damming of rivers, dredging of estuaries, and deforestation of catchments results in alterations to the natural river flow and habitat losses, thus disrupting ecoclinal gradients and impairing the ability of estuarine fauna to move across connected ecosystems. We highlight how the loss in estuarine biodiversity and complexity has diminished biotic resilience and increased the potential for natural ‘disasters. It is also apparent that conservation actions are urgently required before environmental modifications exceed the capacity of estuarine ecosystems to recover from such major perturbations. We document that developing continents with many developing countries, such as South America, require legislation to support a healthy environment, and that more attention needs to be devoted to the social, economic and cultural aspects of traditional communities. We emphasize that plans and actions aimed at estuarine conservation must be based on consistent and statistically testable data that covers natural flow regimes, cycles of environmental contamination, and their influences on estuarine organisms. Environmental protection initiatives for South American estuaries are still in their infancy and steps are required to promote their protection by reducing untreated wastewater disposal, managing exploitation of resources, using stakeholder and co-management approaches, introducing restoration protocols, and improving habitat protection.","Marine protected areas, Estuarine pollution, Wetland loss, Estuarine resources, Anthropogenic modification, Co-management, Artisanal fisheries, Overexploitation"

A structured search, with no date restriction, was performed in LILACS, MEDLINE via Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus, for articles written in English. The inclusion criteria were studies that considered at least two scanners, regardless of method (intra or extraoral), for the production of tooth-supported restorations. Two independent and blinded researchers screened the studies, collected and analyzed the data descriptively. Results 103 studies were included (55 on marginal/internal adaptation, 33 on accuracy, 5 on both outcomes, and 10 reviews). Most of them, shown clinically acceptable adaptation (<120 μm). Factors commonly related to the performance of scanners are: use of anti-reflection powders, method of image acquisition, and restoration/tooth characteristics. The need of anti-reflection powders was controversial. Different scanning principles seems to result on similar performance; IOS that combine them could be promising. The most explored systems were Omnicam - IOS, and inEos X5 - EOS, which showed similar performance on marginal/internal adaptation. Scarce studies explored the performance of EOS systems, especially in terms of accuracy. Different restoration designs as single-unit seemed not to modify the performance of scanners. Limited information is available regarding the planned cement space, restorative material and design (multi-unit restorations), as also techniques to measure adaptation. Conclusions Digital scanners are valid approaches to obtain accurate impressions resulting in clinically acceptable restorations. Systems that uses combined principles of image acquisition seems promising for optimal performance.

Future advancements such as robotic-assisted surgeries, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) and other peri- and preoperative planning tools will continue to revolutionize TSA. Robotic-assisted arthroplasty is a novel and increasingly popular alternative to the conventional arthroplasty procedure in the hip and knee but has not yet been investigated in the shoulder. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct a narrative review of the literature on the evolution and projected trends of technological advances and robotic assistance in total shoulder arthroplasty. Methods A narrative synthesis method was employed for this review, rather than a meta-analysis or systematic review of the literature. This decision was based on 2 primary factors: (1) the lack of eligible, peer-reviewed studies with high-quality level of evidence available for review on robotic-assisted shoulder arthroplasty, and (2) a narrative review allows for a broader scope of content analysis, including a comprehensive review of all technological advances—including robotics—within the field of TSA. A general literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. These databases were queried by 2 independent reviewers from database inception through November 11, 2022, for all articles investigating the role of robotics and technology assistance in total shoulder arthroplasty. Inclusion criteria included studies describing “shoulder arthroplasty” and “robotics.” Results After exclusion criteria were applied, 4 studies on robotic-assisted TSA were described in the review. Given the novelty of this technology and limited data on robotics in TSA, these studies consisted of a literature review, nonvalidated experimental biomechanical studies in sawbones models, and preclinical proof-of-concept cadaveric studies using prototype robotic technology primarily in conjunction with PSI. The remaining studies described the technological advancements in TSA, including PSI, computer-assisted navigation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Although not yet commercially available, robotic-assisted TSA confers the theoretical advantages of precise humeral head cuts for restoration of proximal humerus anatomy, more accurate glenoid preparation, and improved soft-tissue assessment in limited early studies. Conclusion The evidence for the use of robotics in total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty demonstrates improved component accuracy, more precise radiographic measurements, and improved early/mid-term patient-reported and functional outcomes. Although no such data currently exist for shoulder arthroplasty given that the technology has not yet been commercialized, the lessons learned from robotic hip and knee surgery in conjunction with its rapid adoption suggests robotic-assisted TSA is on the horizon of innovation. By achieving a better understanding of the past, present, and future innovations in TSA through this narrative review, orthopedic surgeons can be better prepared for future applications.","Robotic, PSI, navigation, computer-assisted surgery, arthroplasty, shoulder, TSA"

Cemented prostheses have been associated with peri-implant disease because cement remnants act as a reservoir for bacteria and hinder biofilm control. However, contrasting evidence has been presented regarding this association based on studies with varying designs, and a systematic review and meta-analysis is required. Purpose The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to answer the focused question: In patients who received implant-supported prostheses, is the incidence of peri-implant diseases higher in cemented implant-supported prostheses than in screw-retained ones? Material and methods The search was conducted using the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE-PubMed), SCOPUS, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science databases. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that assessed the incidence of peri-implant disease in cement- and screw-retained prostheses were included. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, and analyzed the full texts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The findings were summarized using meta-analyses with random effects, and the level of certainty of the evidence was determined using the grading of recommendations, assessments, development, and evaluations (GRADE) approach. Results The search yielded 4455 articles that met the inclusion criteria based on the title and/or abstract selection. A total of 6 RCTs were included for analysis. The meta-analysis revealed no significant difference between cement- and screw-retained prostheses for the risk of peri-implant mucositis (RR: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.42–4.38, P=.61).

Conventional bone graft materials have limitations, such as limited availability, complication, and rejection. Glass ionomer cement (GIC) is a biomaterial with the potential for bone regeneration due to its bone-contact biocompatibility, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness. GIC is a two-component material that adheres to the bone and releases ions that promote bone growth and mineralization. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and registered in the PROSPERO database to determine the evidence regarding the efficacy and bone-contact biocompatibility of GIC as bone cement. Out of 3715 initial results, thirteen studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Two tools were employed in evaluating the Risk of Bias (RoB): the QUIN tool for assessing in vitro studies and SYRCLE for in vivo. The results indicate that GIC has demonstrated the ability to adhere to bone and promote bone growth. Establishing a chemical bond occurs at the interface between the GIC and the mineral phase of bone. This interaction allows the GIC to exhibit osteoconductive properties and promote the growth of bone tissue. GIC's bone-contact biocompatibility, ease of preparation, and cost-effectiveness make it a promising alternative to conventional bone grafts. However, further research is required to fully evaluate the potential application of GIC in bone regeneration. The findings hold implications for advancing material development in identifying the optimal composition and fabrication of GIC as a bone repair material.","Glass ionomer cement, Bone cement, Bone repair, Biomaterials, Bone regeneration"

Researchers have been aware of the environmental impacts of gold mining activities and have conducted studies in recent years, but they have only selected one gold mining site and collected soil samples in its vicinity for analysis, which does not reflect the combined impact of all gold mining activities on the concentration of potentially toxic trace elements (PTES) in nearby soils at a global scale. In this study, 77 research papers from 24 countries were collected from 2001 to 2022, and a new dataset was developed to provide a comprehensive study of the distribution characteristics, contamination characteristics, and risk assessment of 10 PTEs (As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in soils near the deposits. The results show that the average levels of all 10 elements are higher than the global background values and are at different levels of contamination, with As, Cd, and Hg at strong contamination levels and serious ecological risks. As and Hg contribute to a greater non-carcinogenic risk to both children and adults in the vicinity of the gold mine, and the carcinogenic risks of As, Cd, and Cu are beyond the acceptable range. Gold mining on a global scale has already caused serious impacts on nearby soils and should be given adequate attention. Timely heavy metal treatment and landscape restoration of extracted gold mines and environmentally friendly approaches such as bio-mining of unexplored gold mines where adequate protection is available are of great significance.","Potentially toxic trace elements (PTES), Gold mine, Meta-analysis, Health risk"

These outcomes are compared with those following the placement of smooth machined-neck implants. Materials and methods Using EBSCO Information Services, we conducted a web-based search of databases such as the PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE, for relevant English-language scientific papers published between January 2013 and August 2022. Prospective or retrospective controlled cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the role of rough micro-threaded/LMS implant necks on MBL, sulcular probing depth (PD), and/or clinical attachment loss, were included in this review. Results From a comprehensive literature search of 247 articles, 6 RCTs, 5 prospective studies, and 4 retrospective studies (n = 15) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. MBL with rough micro-threaded implant necks ranged from 0.12 ± 0.17 mm to 3.25 ± 0.4 mm after loading. The smooth machined-neck implants without a micro-threaded neck had a loading MBL of 0.38 ± 0.51 mm to 3.75 ± 0.4 mm. Micro-threaded implant necks showed much lower MBL than machined-neck implants. LMS implant necks had a lower peri-implant PD than machined-neck implants after 3 years of early loading (2.3 ± 0.7 mm vs. 3.8 ± 0.8 mm). The experimental and control groups showed similar gingival recessions (1.08 ± 0.4 mm vs. 2.46 ± 0.3 mm). Meta-analysis was not feasible owing to heterogeneity of the studies. Conclusion Under functional loading, a roughened micro-threaded design for the implant neck could significantly lower MBL. Furthermore, PD and MBL were much lower around LMS neck implants than those around machined-neck or micro-threaded implants.","Laser-microstructured implants, Machined-neck, Marginal bone loss, Micro-threaded implants, Peri-implantitis"

To tackle these challenges, researchers are exploring innovative geopolymer (GPL) concrete technology. However, cracks are inevitable in concrete structures due to various factors, and if left unaddressed, these cracks can allow the passage of harmful substances, leading to reduced service life and structural failure. Therefore, immediate crack repairs are crucial, but manual fixes are expensive and time-taking. Self-healing geopolymer (SHG) concrete offers a revolutionary solution by addressing these predicaments. Although extensive literature exists on SHG concrete, none of the investigations have examined and summarized its characteristics and applicability in the construction industry. SHG materials commonly include fly ash, metakaolin, and granulated blast furnace slag. The main objective of this scientometric evaluation is to assess the mechanical characteristics, self-healing (SH) agents, durability behavior, and the ability of products of GPL to self-heal process. The results show that SHG products exhibit greater resistance to ecological degradation, improved mechanical performance compared to concrete, and excellent SH capabilities facilitated by the formation of new bonding among various fractured surfaces and internal cracks when subjected to humidity. While bacteria are commonly used as healing agents, new options like glass frit and different types of reinforcement fibers have been introduced but with lower healing competence. The review work accomplishes by highlighting the necessity for more experimental investigations to completely comprehend the behavior and effectiveness of SHG in the construction industry.","Geopolymer composites, Sustainability, Self-healing, Durability, Metakaolin, Compressive strength"

The Northern Calcareous Alps represent the salt-floored fold-and-thrust belt developed from the salt-influenced Triassic carbonate sedimentary cover of the ancestral European margin of the Neo-Tethys Ocean. A crustal scale model for the margin has been obtained by restoration of regional cross-sections of the Northern Calcareous Alps carbonate platforms. Lithospheric break-up was investigated from remnants of exhumed mantle found within an evaporitic melange, suggesting hyperextended crust underneath the distal Triassic platforms of the Northern Calcareous Alps preceding breakup. By modelling the thermal evolution of the margin in combination with excellent stratigraphic control, a detailed timeline has been established for the evolution of the Neo-Tethys margin, especially around the period of rapid mantle exhumation. Our study indicates that salt-floored carbonate shelfs can be used as a proxy to characterize the margins evolution, from crustal stretching to continental breakup. Diagnostic stratigraphic records are preserved in the carbonate platforms: pre- mantle exhumation carbonates are represented by aggrading isolated carbonate platforms first, followed by expanding and margin wide prograding carbonate shelfs once thermal subsidence dominates. In addition, a distinct clastic sequence is deposited as an immediate response to mantle exhumation, in between the pre- and post-mantle exhumation carbonate factory. Our study proposes a new refined model for the formation of the Neo-Tethys margin and provides new insights for the dynamic coupling of salt-controlled carbonate shelfs and the underlying lithosphere during continental breakup.","Rifted margin, Neo-Tethys, Fold-and-thrust belt, Salt tectonics, Balanced crosssection, Thermal modelling"

More than 70% of raw materials originated from gibbsitic bauxite. This work reviews existing and potential process from open literature to treat gibbsitic bauxite and reduce red mud discharge from the alumina production process, which are divided into two categories. The first strategy involves non-Bayer methods such as smelting reduction, reduction roasting, sub-molten salt, ammonium sulfate roasting, acid leaching, and calcification–carbonation. The current obstacle to implementing these methods is the lack of economics, making industrial application challenging. The second potential industrial application strategy is to modify the current Bayer process, with critical measures involving the enhancement digestion of inert aluminum-bearing minerals, dissociation and recovery of iron minerals, and separation of desilication products. Analyzing the reaction mechanism and process flow clarify that the modified Bayer method is more favorable to the cost-effectively and synergistic extraction of aluminum, iron, and other elements. The red mud obtained by the modified Bayer process can be efficiently utilized. Therefore, a mini-summary of the areas where red mud is expected to be substantially dissipated (e.g., the steel industry, cement building materials, and ecological restoration of red mud stockpiles) is provided. The review can advance the current technology on the comprehensive utilization of gibbsitic bauxite, especially process discharge reduction approaches and large-scale abatement ways for red mud.

The implications of this knowledge were used to justify how these defects are managed clinically. Data, Sources and Study selection Literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for a narrative review on fracture mechanics of crown and root dentine as well as the clinical management of cracked teeth and teeth with vertical root fracture. Conclusions Although dentine is tougher and less brittle than enamel, it's facture toughness is considerably lower than most ductile metals. Because the initiation toughness of dentine is very low, cracks initiate from incipient damage under low stress While crack toughening mechanisms exist that enable dentine to resist crack extension, these mechanisms are often inadequate for protecting dentine from crack propagation that ultimately leads to catastrophic failure. Additional factors such as ageing also reduces the resistance of dentine to crack growth. Because dentine cracks are eventually filled with bacteria biofilms upon exposure to oral fluids, they enable rapid bacteria ingress into the dental pulp via open dentinal tubules. To date, treatment options for cracked teeth are limited. While most teeth with vertical root fracture are recommended for extraction, new strategies have been reported that appeared to achieve short-term success in preserving these teeth. Clinical Significance Current strategies for the management for dentine cracks and fractures are limited and their long-term effectiveness remain uncertain. Understanding the characteristics, toughening mechanism and weakening factors of tooth cracks is helpful in designing better treatment.","Biomechanical, Crack, Fracture toughness, Management, Vertical root fracture"

However, the physiological regeneration process can be impaired when there is an extensive damage. One of the main reasons is due to the inability to establish a new vascular network that ensures oxygen and nutrient diffusion, leading to a necrotic core and non-junction of bone. Initially, bone tissue engineering (BTE) emerged to use inert biomaterials to just fill bone defects, but it eventually evolved to mimic bone extracellular matrix and even stimulate bone physiological regeneration process. In this regard, the stimulation of osteogenesis has gained a lot of attention especially in the proper stimulation of angiogenesis, being critical to achieve a successful osteogenesis for bone regeneration. Besides, the immunomodulation of a pro-inflammatory environment towards an anti-inflammatory one upon scaffold implantation has been considered another key process for a proper tissue restoration. To stimulate these phases, growth factors and cytokines have been extensively used. Nonetheless, they present some drawbacks such as low stability and safety concerns. Alternatively, the use of inorganic ions has attracted higher attention due to their higher stability and therapeutic effects with low side effects. This review will first focus in giving fundamental aspects of initial bone regeneration phases, focusing mainly on inflammatory and angiogenic ones. Then, it will describe the role of different inorganic ions in modulating the immune response upon biomaterial implantation towards a restorative environment and their ability to stimulate angiogenic response for a proper scaffold vascularization and successful bone tissue restoration. Statement of significance The impairment of bone tissue regeneration when there is excessive damage has led to different tissue engineered strategies to promote bone healing. Significant importance has been given in the immunomodulation towards an anti-inflammatory environment together with proper angiogenesis stimulation in order to achieve successful bone regeneration rather than stimulating only the osteogenic differentiation. Ions have been considered potential candidates to stimulate these events due to their high stability and therapeutic effects with low side effects compared to growth factors. However, up to now, no review has been published assembling all this information together, describing individual effects of ions on immunomodulation and angiogenic stimulation, as well as their multifunctionality or synergistic effects when combined together.","Angiogenesis, Immunomodulation, Ions, Bone regeneration, Bone tissue engineering"

Cement consumption and concrete production have been found to impact sustainability the most. The current study proposes an outline for the sustainability assessment in terms of cost, carbon emission (CO2-e), and energy demand for concrete production. The assessment of Limestone Calcined Clay Cement (LC3) concrete is compared to conventional cement-based concrete (OPC) and Geopolymer concrete (GPC) in terms of mechanical strength and sustainable performance. The study examines the energy demand for producing OPC, GPC, and LC3 concrete of normal (M40) and high-strength (M70) concrete. The assessment shows that selecting concrete mix ingredients can substantially influence the energy demand and CO2-e of OPC, GPC, and LC3 concrete. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is the major contributor to energy and CO2-e, accounting for 88% of energy requirement and 95% of the CO2-e of OPC concrete. In the case of GPC, the Alkaline medium is the major contributor to energy and CO2-e. Based on the sustainability index analysis, the LC3 system was a more cost-effective, energy-effective, and carbon-effective material than GPC and OPC-based concrete. The present study shows that compressive strength is directly related to cost, energy demand, and carbon emission. Furthermore, the analysis indicates how concrete mixture is adopted for particular concrete grades to achieve sustainability and eco-friendly practices.","Cement concrete, Geopolymer concrete, LC, Life-cycle assessment, Sustainability performance"

In wide range of applications, from lime to cement–based materials, its hardening performance relies on the pozzolanic reactivity between MK and calcium hydroxide (CH), resulting in the formation of diverse calcium-aluminate/silicate hydrates. The reaction sequence is affected by specific conditions dictated by the binder system employed in various applications. To advance the design of binders that reduce the carbon emissions, a systematical review on MK-based reactions is crucial. This review encompasses a broad range of MK/CH ratios and examines the effect of alkali hydroxides, carbonates and sulfates. The focus is on the formation and stability of pozzolanic hydrate phases over time and under different curing temperatures. Additionally, the review addresses the characteristics that directly affect MK reactivity, such as the (calcined) clay structure and the dissolution of the reactants. The systematic findings shed light on the hydrate phase assemblage, enabling a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms in complex systems, like MK cementitious blends. The results of this review serve as a valuable foundation for the development of novel “low-carbon” binder designs and compositions for both cementitious and lime-based binders.","Metakaolin, Calcium hydroxide, Pozzolan, Phase transformation, Lime mortar, Supplementary cementitious materials (SCM)"

Although some soil is naturally enriched with heavy metals (HMs), a series of anthropogenic activities are known to contribute to their redistribution, which may entail potentially harmful environmental and/or human health effects if certain concentrations are exceeded. If this occurs, the implementation of rehabilitation strategies is highly recommended. Although there are many publications dealing with the elimination of HMs using different methodologies, most of those works have been done in laboratories and there are not many comprehensive reviews about the results obtained under field conditions. Throughout this review, we examine the different methodologies that have been used in real scenarios and, based on representative case studies, we present the evolution and outcomes of the remediation strategies applied in real soil-contamination events where legacies of past metal mining activities or mine spills have posed a serious threat for soil conservation. So far, the best efficiencies at field-scale have been reported when using combined strategies such as physical containment and assisted-phytoremediation. We have also introduced the emerging problem of the heavy metal contamination of agricultural soils and the different strategies implemented to tackle this problem. Although remediation techniques used in real scenarios have not changed much in the last decades, there are also encouraging facts for the advances in this field. Thus, a growing number of mining companies publicise in their webpages their soil remediation strategies and efforts; moreover, the number of scientific publications about innovative highly-efficient and environmental-friendly methods is also increasing.

However, Y-TZP is chemically inert and non-reactive, demanding surface modification using alternative approaches to enhance its bond strength to resin-matrix cements. The main aim of this study was to conduct an integrative review on the influence of ultrashort pulse laser patterning of zirconia (3Y-TZP) for enhanced bonding to resin-matrix cements. An electronic search was performed on web of science, SCOPUS, Pubmed/Medline, Google Scholar and EMBASE using a combination of the following search items: zirconia, 3Y-TZP, surface modification, laser surface treatment, AND laser, ultrashortpulse laser, bonding, adhesion, and resin cement. Articles published in the English language, up to January 2022, were included regarding the influence of surface patterning on bond strength of Y-TZP to resin-matrix cements. Out of the 12 studies selected for the present review 10 studies assessed femtosecond lasers while 2 studies assessed picosecond lasers. Ultrashort pulsed laser surface patterning successfully produced different surface morphological aspects without damaging the bulk properties of zirconia. Contrarily, defects such as micro-cracks occurs after surface modification using traditional methods such as grit-blasting or long-pulsed laser patterning. Ultrashort pulsed laser surface patterning increase bond strength of zirconia to resin-matrix cements and therefore such alternative physical method should be considered in dentistry. Also, surface defects were avoided using ultrashort pulsed laser surface patterning, which become the major advantage when compared with traditional physical methods or long pulse laser patterning.","Zirconia (3Y-TZP), Laser, Ultrashort pulse laser patterning, Adhesion, Bond strength, Surface treatment"

This review paper aims to provide an overview of the current status on the utilization of lasers as a potential tool for surface modification of dental biomaterials such as implants, ceramics, and other materials used for restorative purposes. A literature search was done for articles related to the use of lasers for surface modification of dental biomaterials in English language published between October 2000 and March 2023 in Scopus, Pubmed and web of science, and relevant articles were reviewed. Lasers have been mainly used for surface modification of implant materials (71%), especially titanium and its alloys, to promote osseointegration. In recent years, laser texturing has also emerged as a promising technique to reduce bacterial adhesion on titanium implant surfaces. Currently, lasers are being widely used for surface modifications to improve osseointegration and reduce peri-implant inflammation of ceramic implants and to enhance the retention of ceramic restorations to the tooth. The studies considered in this review seem to suggest laser texturing to be more proficient than the conventional methods of surface modification. Lasers can alter the surface characteristics of dental biomaterials by creating innovative surface patterns without significantly affecting their bulk properties. With advances in laser technology and availability of newer wavelengths and modes, laser as a tool for surface modification of dental biomaterials is a promising field, with excellent potential for future research.","Laser, Dental implant, Ceramics, Surface pattern, Surface topography, Osseointegration"

Evidence on the comparative efficacy of posts in a clinical setting is insufficient to provide clear clinical guidelines and recommendations. Purpose The purpose of this systematic review with network meta-analysis was to assess the comparative efficacy of fiber and metal posts used for the restoration of endodontically treated teeth. Material and methods A search was conducted for trials published in Medline, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until November 2022. The study was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42022384340). A network meta-analysis was performed on data from randomized controlled trials that assessed the comparative efficacy of fiber posts and metal posts for the restoration of endodontically treated teeth. Subgroup analyses were performed to compare all the varieties of fiber and metal posts. The types of posts were ranked according to their efficacy using the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) system. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was used to assess the level of certainty of evidence. Results Twenty-five articles were included in the quantitative analysis. Fiber posts (RR=0.15 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.33]) significantly prevented tooth fracture as compared with no posts. Prefabricated carbon fiber posts (RR=0.06 [95% CI: 0, 0.54]) ranked highest followed by custom glass fiber posts (RR=0.15 [95% CI: 0.04, 0.52]) and prefabricated glass fiber posts (RR=0.22 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.62]) in the outcome of tooth fracture. Metal posts (RR=0.24 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.46]) ranked higher than fiber posts (RR=0.39 [95% CI: 0.27, 0.56]) in the outcome of debonding. Custom gold alloy posts (RR=0.12 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.48]), prefabricated gold alloy posts (RR=0.04 [95% CI: 0.00, 0.87]), and prefabricated titanium posts (RR=0.21 [95% CI: 0.10, 0.45]) had higher rankings in the outcome of debonding or loss of retention of a post followed by custom glass fiber posts (RR=0.37 [95% CI: 0.21, 0.63]) and prefabricated glass fiber posts (RR=0.38 [95%CI: 0.25, 0.58]). Prefabricated glass fiber posts (RR=0.40 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.81]) had statistically significant differences in the outcome of secondary caries. The GRADE approach determined a moderate level of certainty of evidence. Conclusions The use of a fiber post when indicated results in reduced risk of tooth fracture as compared with no post. Prefabricated carbon fiber posts, prefabricated glass fiber posts, and custom glass fiber posts reveal a lower risk of tooth fracture. Overall, the use of prefabricated glass fiber posts had a lower risk of tooth fracture, debonding, and secondary caries. However, more trials with longer follow-up periods are recommended to enhance the certainty of evidence.",

Scientists generally consider that silver disrupts the bacterial cell wall. It causes a structural change in the bacterial cell membrane and cytoplasm. It also stops deoxyribonucleic acid replication, resulting in inactivating enzymatic activity and cell death. The antimicrobial effect of silver-containing compounds relies on the release of bioactive silver ions. Hence, silver metal and compounds have been used in medicine to prevent infection for hundreds of years. Silver metal and compounds are also used as antibacterial agents in dentistry. Studies have shown that silver compounds are effective in the management of dental caries. Fluoride-containing silver compounds have been found in experiments to be beneficial at remineralising dental cavities. Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) can assist in preventing and arresting tooth cavities. The World Health Organization included SDF in its Model List of Essential Medicine for both adults and children in 2021. Clinicians also use SDF to manage dentine hypersensitivity as well as to inhibit growth of periodontal pathogens. However, traditional silver compounds cause tooth discolouration because of the silver-staining effect. These side effects of their applications depend on the amount applied and the frequency of application. Researchers are developing nanosilver fluoride and silver nanoparticles to overcome the staining. This review gives an overview of the antibacterial mechanism of silver compounds, namely silver nitrate, silver fluoride, SDF, silver nanoparticles, and nano silver fluoride for caries management. The outlook for the future development of silver compounds will be discussed.","Caries, Silver, Fluoride, Silver diamine fluoride, Nanoparticles, Prevention"

Sustainable development is a global priority and requires a systemic, integrative approach from all sectors of society. The oral healthcare sector is responsible for substantial greenhouse emissions throughout its value chain, including raw material extraction, industrial production, supply distribution, clinical practice, and management of waste. Of all dental specialties, prosthodontics has been one of the main generators of carbon emissions by fabricating a single product such as dentures or crowns in multiple steps. Dental prosthetic procedures involve chemicals and materials such as polymers, ceramics, metals, gypsum, and wax, which are often used in large quantities and for a single use. Thus, environmental risks and socioeconomic burdens can result from residuals and improper disposal, as well as waste and the embedded costs of unused materials retained by manufacturers, retail suppliers, dental laboratories, and dental clinics. To mitigate the environmental impact generated by conventional prosthodontics, we urge awareness and the adoption of sustainable good practices in the daily routine of dental clinics and laboratories.

Type of Studies Reviewed The authors included parallel and split-mouth randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of direct restorative materials commercially available in the United States placed in vital, nonendodontically treated primary and permanent teeth. Pairs of reviewers independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and assessments of risk of bias and certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The authors conducted pair-wise meta-analyses to summarize the evidence and calculated measures of association and their 95% CIs. Results Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials were eligible for analysis, which included data on Class I and Class II restorations on primary teeth and Class I, Class II, Class III, Class V, and root surface restorations on permanent teeth. Included studies assessed the effect of amalgam, resin composite, compomer, conventional glass ionomer cement, resin-modified glass ionomer cement, and preformed metal crowns.

These low damage fuse components keep the structure elastic state during design basis earthquakes and allow for cost-effective post-earthquake restoration following a major seismic event. Further, statistical analyses of the literature are performed using trend, percentage contribution, and term co-occurrence maps. Lastly, research gaps are recognized, and future scope in the domain is suggested.","Isolated Fuse, Integrated Fuse, Energy Dissipating Device, Plastic Hinge, Resilient structures"

The World Health Organization listed antimicrobial resistance as one of ten major global public health threats in 2021. In particular, six major bacterial pathogens, including third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were found to have the highest resistance-related death rates in 2019. To respond to this urgent call, the creation of new pharmaceutical technologies based on nanoscience and drug delivery systems appears to be the promising strategy against microbial resistance in light of recent advancements, particularly the new knowledge of medicinal biology. Nanomaterials are often defined as substances having sizes between 1 and 100 nm. If the material is used on a small scale; its properties significantly change. They come in a variety of sizes and forms to help provide distinguishing characteristics for a wide range of functions. The field of health sciences has demonstrated a strong interest in numerous nanotechnology applications. Therefore, in this review, prospective nanotechnology-based therapeutics for the management of bacterial infections with multiple medication resistance are critically examined. Recent developments in these innovative treatment techniques are described, with an emphasis on preclinical, clinical, and combinatorial approaches.","Microbial resistance, Nanotechnology, Bacterial infection, Drug delivery"

Inspired by the self-healing phenomenon in nature, various biomimetic healing methods rooted in intrinsic or extrinsic healing mechanisms have been explored. Research on novel self-healing asphalt materials with intelligent response is at the cutting-edge of materials science and offers a potential strategy for building long-life and low-carbon asphalt concrete infrastructure. This paper describes the progress of research on extrinsic self-healing asphalt materials and makes a clear distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic self-healing. The asphalt self-healing mechanism is interpreted by capillary flow theory, phase field theory, molecular diffusion theory and surface energy theory form various perspective. The extrinsic self-healing strategies including thermal induced healing and rejuvenator induced healing are proposed to enhance the healing level of cracked asphalt materials. A brief review of the methods including fracture-healing test and fatigue-healing test for assessing the efficacy of different extrinsic healing methods is presented. The thermal induced healing method bring high crack repair efficiency for asphalt concrete and the rejuvenator induced healing strategy not only improve the healing ratio of cracked asphalt concrete but also regenerate the ageing asphalt in situ. Important lessons for prospective research on the creation of novel self-healing asphalt materials are highlighted.","Asphalt materials, Extrinsic self-healing, Mechanisms, Sustainability"

Purpose The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the current literature on the direct and indirect restoration of endodontically treated posterior teeth. Material and methods Databases MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE were screened. Risk of bias was assessed by using the ROB2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for prospective and retrospective clinical studies. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective studies comparing direct composite resin and indirect restorations on endodontically treated posterior teeth were included. Outcomes were tooth and restoration survival. A meta-analysis was conducted for tooth retention and restorative success. Results Twenty-two studies were included (2 RCTs, 3 prospective, and 17 retrospective). Over the short term (2.5 to 3 years), low-quality evidence suggested no difference in tooth survival. For the prospective and retrospective clinical trials, the overall risk of bias was serious to critical from the risk of confounding because of a difference in restorative indication: Direct restorations were fabricated when one marginal ridge remained or when tooth prognosis was unfavorable. For short-term restorative success, low-quality evidence suggested no difference between the direct and indirect restorations. Conclusions For the short term (2.5 to 3 years), low-quality evidence suggests no difference in tooth survival or restoration quality.

Data Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) investigating direct and indirect resin composite restorations in posterior permanent teeth were considered. Sources Several electronic databases were searched, with no language or date restrictions. The revised Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB-2) was used to analyze the studies; meta-analyses were run and the certainty of evidence was assessed by the GRADE tool. A subgroup meta-analysis was performed for resin composite restorations placed on posterior worn dentition. Study selection Twenty-three articles were included in qualitative synthesis, while 8 studies were used for meta-analyses. According to the RoB-2 tool, 5 studies were ranked as “low risk”, 7 had “some concerns”, while 11 papers were rated as “high risk” of bias. There were no statistically significant differences in short-term (p = 0.27; RR=1.54, 95% CI [0.72, 3.33]), medium-term (p = 0.27; RR=1.87, 95% CI [0.61, 5.72]) and long-term longevity (p = 0.86; RR=0.95, 95% CI [0.57, 1.59]).

However, asphalt reserves are expected to last no more than 50 years. The apparent alternative, Portland Cement Concrete, has its limitations, such as environmental emissions and poor riding quality. Since its inception, Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) has been suggested as an alternative pavement material in scattered studies over the years. This study aims to compile and present the state-of-art in ECC-related pavement applications and clearly define the research gaps so that future researchers in this area can carry out their work efficiently. It is observed that ECC has primarily been used as an overlay over both asphalt and concrete substrates rather than as a full-depth pavement material. Other application areas include bridge deck pavements, repair works, multi-layer pavements, and special function applications. Research related to the comparative life cycle and life cycle cost assessment of ECC pavements is also reviewed in this study. One significant benefit of using ECC in pavements that is noted is that slab joints can be eliminated due to the high ductility of ECC. ECC also has the potential to greatly reduce pavement reflective cracking and life-cycle environmental impacts. While the absence of coarse aggregates produces a smooth surface for excellent riding quality, it also poses the risk of low pavement skid resistance. Another important and well-known drawback of ECC, especially for such a large-scale application, is the high construction cost. Some of these problems have been solved to a certain degree using waste alternative materials and rough fine aggregates such as corundum. More research is needed to understand the prospects of ECC as a full-depth pavement material rather than just an overlay. Future work revolving around more large-scale field demonstration, durability enhancement, further cost reduction, and life-cycle impact reduction is desirable for enhanced applicability of ECC in road infrastructure.","Engineered cementitious composite, Pavement systems, Multi-layer pavements, Bridge deck, Pavement overlays"

However, the application of SEKR has been met with multiple obstacles; thus, trials have been introduced to overcome these limitations. The present study provides a comprehensive review of various modifications applied to SEKR process designs. We classified the SEKR designs in horizontal, vertical, and mixed (horizontal and vertical) types as per the movement of contaminants. SEKR is conducted via four mechanisms, namely electromigration, electroosmosis, diffusion, and electrophoresis, when a direct current electrical field is applied among two electrodes to achieve contaminant movement from one location to another. During SEKR operation, the removal rate can be adversely affected by factors such as the formation of a pH jumping zone, very high (low) pH around the cathode (anode), polarization, and reduced current efficiency with increase in time. Accordingly, in a previous research, the regular design of SEKR has been modified to address these and other limitations. Moreover, soil electrokinetic (SEK) has been used for other applications such as land restoration, geophysics, dewatering, and consolidation. This review primarily aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the major design modification made to SEK processes in the past 28 years, (1993–2020) to facilitate research on the major aspects of SEK. As per our extensive literature survey, most relevant studies focused on the horizontal SEK design. This study discusses relevant SEK studies in which process design modification is considered.","Soil electrokinetic remediation, Process modification design, Principles, Basics, SEKR obstacles, Improved performance"

When provoked, ‘ureolytic bacteria,’ such as Bacillus pasteurii or Bacillus subtilis, which produce ‘urease’ enzymes in the rumen, can produce precipitations of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the concrete. Because their cell wall is anionic, CaCO3 accumulates on the surface in large amounts, causing the entire cell to crystallize and eventually clog pores and fissures. This approach of spontaneous induction is an atmospherically beneficial way upon which experts are currently researching. In the present study, the use of bacteriological healing to produce autonomous SH microbial concrete is discussed. It also includes an extensive review of various characteristics of these new concrete types that depict the differences in the auto-addition of various bacteria, as well as an assessment of the healing of cracks because of the addition of bacteria in concrete in a shell that is protective. Relative evaluation methodologies for autonomous and bio-based SH too are reviewed, along with progress, ability, modalities of application, as well as the resulting benefits in terms of durability and strength. The impact of bacteria on the stiffness and compressive strength (CS) of cement paste cubes is also taken into account. The importance of bacteria in microbiologically induced mineral precipitation is also examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. Finally, the scope of upcoming investigations and current research gaps are identified and elaborated. Results indicated that the CaCO3 precipitation in the concrete could be attributable to the presence of various ions in the media. Therefore, bio-mineralized concrete has minimized permeability and porosity. The addition of Bacillus subtilis and Sparcious pasteurii species to concrete lessened chloride penetration, enhancing the falling tendency of the sulfate-exposed concrete mass.","Self-healing, Cracking, Durability, Microstructural analysis, Concrete, Bacillus pasteurii"

Therefore, a systematic assessment of the impact of the prosthetic material, framework design, veneering material, and manufacturing process is required. Purpose The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the survival and success rates of feldspathic porcelain veneered zirconia (VZir) in comparison with monolithic zirconia (MZir) complete arch implant-supported prostheses (CAISPs). A secondary objective was to assess the influence of the type of loading, the presence or absence of a cantilever, the type of zirconia used, the location, and the opposing arch on complications rates and patient satisfaction. Material and methods An electronic search of the MEDLINE database (via PubMed), Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and OpenGrey was carried out. The criteria described in the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement were used. The search was restricted from January 2000 to January 2022. Results The systematic search resulted in 20 articles that met the established criteria. In total, 751 patients (VZir=302; MZir=449) with 3038 CAISPs (VZir=368; MZir=2670) were analyzed. Higher prosthetic survival and success rates were found in MZir compared with VZir CAISPs (100% and 95.45%, respectively). The meta-analysis found significantly fewer complications related to MZir (9.4% [4.8%-14.1%]) compared with VZir (33.7% [17.5%-49.9%]). Conclusions Based on the findings of this systematic review, MZir CAISPs had higher survival and success rates than VZir CAISPs, with significantly fewer prosthetic complications.

Regenerative dentistry, utilizing stem cells and bioactive materials, offers a promising approach for regenerating dental tissues. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) and bioactive materials like calcium phosphate (CaP) and silicate-based materials have shown potential for dental tissue regeneration. This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of CaP and silicate-based materials on hDPSCs through in vitro studies published since 2015. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search strategy was implemented in PubMed MedLine, Cochrane, and ScienceDirect databases. Eligibility criteria were established using the PICOS scheme. Data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment were conducted, with the included studies assessed for bias using the Office of Health and Translation (OHAT) RoB tool. The research has been registered at OSF Registries. Ten in vitro studies met the eligibility criteria out of 1088 initial studies. Methodological heterogeneity and the use of self-synthesized biomaterials with limited generalizability were observed in the included study. The findings highlight the positive effect of CaP and silicate-based materials on hDPSCs viability, adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. While the overall RoB assessment indicated satisfactory credibility of the reviewed studies, the limited number of studies and methodological heterogeneity pose challenges for quantitative research. In conclusion, this systematic review provides valuable insights into the effects of CaP and silicate-based materials on hDPSCs. Further research is awaited to enhance our understanding and optimize regenerative dental treatments using bioactive materials and hDPSCs, which promise to improve patient outcomes.","Calcium phosphate, Silicates, Regenerative medicine, Dental pulp, Stem cells"

However, its use is declining, mainly driven by its poor aesthetics and by the development of tooth-coloured adhesive materials. Furthermore, the Minamata Convention agreed on a phase-down on the use of dental amalgam. This concise review is based on a FDI Policy Statement which provides guidance on the selection of direct restorative materials as alternatives to amalgam. The Policy Statement was informed by current literature, identified mainly from PubMed and the internet. Ultimately, dental, oral, and patient factors should be considered when choosing the best material for each individual case. Dental factors include the dentition, tooth type, and cavity class and extension; oral aspects comprise caries risk profiles and related risk factors; and patient-related aspects include systemic risks/medical conditions such as allergies towards certain materials as well as compliance. Special protective measures (eg, a no-touch technique, blue light protection) are required when handling resin-based materials, and copious water spray is recommended when adjusting or removing restorative materials. Cost and reimbursement policies may need to be considered when amalgam alternatives are used, and the material recommendation requires the informed consent of the patient. There is no single material which can replace amalgam in all applications; different materials are needed for different situations. The policy statement recommends using a patient-centred rather than purely a material-centred approach. Further research is needed to improve overall material properties, the clinical performance, the impact on the environment, and cost-effectiveness of all alternative materials.","Minimal intervention, Resin-based composite, Glass ionomer cement, Dental amalgam"

During 1993–2020, SEK research was classified into three main approaches: horizontal (19 processes), vertical (11 processes), and mixed (7 processes), based on the position of the anodes and cathodes that control element movement. In the present review, we surveyed SEK design modifications during 2021–2022 to provide readers with an update on new SEK innovations incorporated with regular designs. Based on our search of six of the most popular research engines, most of the design modifications carried out in SEK were mainly focused on the horizontal process, and few studies focused on vertical design; however, no research has focused on the SEK mixed approach (combining horizontal and vertical processes). In 2021 and 2022, the SEK horizontal approach involved 13 processes.

The associated multi-scale processes that are addressed are of major societal importance, in terms of geohazards (e.g., earthquakes), geo-resources (e.g., geothermal energy, groundwater) and environmental / climatic changes (e.g., dynamic topography). Investigation of these processes in such natural laboratories and through the various applied multi-disciplinary approaches improves our understanding of the dynamic evolution of sedimentary basins and guides the future sustainable exploitation of geo-resources in the context of climate change mitigation. Throughout this special issue, fluids and their interaction with host-rocks are highlighted because most of the future usages of the subsurface will involve injecting fluids and gases underground (e.g., geothermal energy, hydrogen, or CO2 storage), and the dynamics and impacts of these applications still need to be properly understood.","Geo-resources, Dynamic topography, Seismicity, Fault mechanics, Diagenesis"

Public authorities ought to preserve and safeguard such structures for future generations. However, precise evaluation of the current condition of such historical inheritance is crucial to appraise the need for adequate restoration and preservation work. Yet, ambiguity related to the absence of design and construction information and lack of data on the materials used makes this task a daunting challenge. Therefore, there has been considerable research into developing pertinent methodologies and technologies. Evaluating the safety of such heritage masonry structures typically requires in-situ inspections and surveys, sampling and testing, and balancing data from multiple diagnosis activities to select the best strategy for conservation and protection. Despite its operational benefits, this approach is costly, laborious, requires a high degree of professional skill, is unable to unveil hidden defects, and may escalate future maintenance costs. A promising alternative solution is structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Accordingly, this paper systematically reviews damage detection and SHM techniques for masonry structures. The different measurement methods for SHM are classified into sensor-based and remote sensing methods, while the analyses methods are divided into signal and image processing techniques, artificial intelligence, and numerical techniques. The advantages and disadvantages of the various methods are discussed and compared. The related knowledge gaps are identified, recommendations for best practice are formulated, and the need for future research is identified.","Structural health monitoring, Heritage structures, Historical construction, Masonry, Damage identification, Crack detection"

Although previous classifications have been useful, they need updating to include stems that have current surface treatment technologies, modularity, collar features, and other geometric characteristics. Methods To accomplish this, we propose a new classification system for stems based on 3 distinguishing stem features: (1) geometry, (2) location of modularity, and (3) length. Results Our system allows for the easy classification of all currently used stem types. Conclusions One goal of this endeavor is to improve clinical record keeping to facilitate study comparisons as well as literature reviews.","cementless THA, classification of femoral components, geometry, location of modularity, length"

Due to its positive connotation, it is frequently utilised for advertising dental restorative materials. However, there is confusion about what the term means, and concerns have been raised about its potential overuse. Therefore, FDI decided to publish a Policy Statement about the bioactivity of dental restorative materials to clarify the term and provide some caveats for its use in advertising. Background information for this Policy Statement was taken from the current literature, mainly from the PubMed database and the internet. Bioactive restorative materials should have beneficial/desired effects. These effects should be local, intended, and nontoxic and should not interfere with a material's principal purpose, namely dental tissue replacement. Three mechanisms for the bioactivity of such materials have been identified: purely biological, mixed biological/chemical, or strictly chemical. Therefore, when the term bioactivity is used in an advertisement or in a description of a dental restorative material, scientific evidence (in vitro or in situ, and preferably in clinical studies) should be provided describing the mechanism of action, the duration of the effect (especially for materials releasing antibacterial substances), and the lack of significant adverse biological side effects (including the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance). Finally, it should be documented that the prime purpose, for instance, to be used to rebuild the form and function of lost tooth substance or lost teeth, is not impaired, as demonstrated by data from in vitro and clinical studies. The use of the term bioactive dental restorative material in material advertisement/information should be restricted to materials that fulfil all the requirements as described in the FDI Policy Statement.","Repair, Regeneration, Caries, Pulp, Calcium silicate cement, Fluoride"

These materials are challenged inside the mouth by bacterial acid attack, lack of bioactivity, and the scarcity of alternatives maintaining the mechanical properties over the lifetime service of these materials. Core-shell nanostructures are composed of various materials surrounded by a protective shell. They are acquiring considerable attention as innovative multipurpose carriers that show great potential in restorative dentistry. Herein, we systematically reviewed the recent studies on core-shell nanostructures incorporated into dental resin-based materials, their intended properties, synthesis methods, and assessment tests employed. This study used scoping review method, following Arksey and O'Malley's five stages framework using PubMed and Scopus (Elsevier) databases. From 149 initially identified manuscripts, 20 studies were eligible for full-text screening, and 15 were included for data extraction. The majority of included studies have used resin composite as parental material. Silica oxide was the most prevailing shell incorporated into dental resins. Almost all core-shell nanostructures were added to improve the material's strength and impart antibacterial properties. Designing strategies and drug release behaviors were discussed. In the end, current challenges and prospects in this promising field were highlighted.","Nanoparticles, Nanotechnology, Dental caries, Drug delivery, Dental materials"

Biodeterioration caused by lichens and biofilm-forming microorganisms on these artworks has gained growing attention in the field of cultural heritage conservation. The current approach is focused on planned removal of lithobionts whenever they cause objective damage and/or structural impairments to the substrate. Cleaning may sometimes be followed by the application of organic and/or inorganic products for protection and consolidation of the artworks. The lithobiontic recolonization after cleaning and coating treatments is considered as one of the most challenging subjects nowadays. It is expected to occur in outdoor conditions, particularly on porous substrates, in shaded areas, and in areas that remain moist over time. Two aspects connected to this topic are the recolonization of surfaces after removal of biofilms and lichens, and the recolonization of cleaned surfaces treated with consolidants and/or water repellents. This paper reviews the scientific advances of the last two decades on i) recolonization of artworks, and ii) interaction between synthetic polymers and lithobionts.","Natural and artificial stone artworks, Lithobionts, Cleaning, Water repellents, Consolidants, Recolonization, Bioreceptivity"

In this article, a review of previous studies is carried out that applied gypsum residues in cement hydration and as a partial substitute for cement and sand. For this, a survey was carried out in the databases: Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science. It is verified that the chemical composition of several gypsum residues and by-products are similar, moreover their recycling does not change their composition. However, the type of calcium sulfate can interfere with the hydration reactions of tricalcium aluminate. Gypsum, when used in partial replacement of cement, reduces mechanical resistance, but when used with fly ash, it provides better long-term resistance. The apparent density values in the hardened state are reduced with the replacement of sand by gypsum. The compressive strength also decreases, but on the other hand, the flexural strength increases with the use of gypsum, this happened due to the free water content being higher when using gypsum, which was corroborated for cement hydration and resistance mechanics. Considering that there may be changes in the properties of both cement and mortar when using gypsum, studies still need to be carried out to evaluate the technological properties and its durability, moreover to this, a more in-depth analysis of the feasibility of adding gypsum to cement-based mortar is necessary recommended.","Gypsum, By-product, Residue, Calcium sulfate, Cement, Mortar"

The behavior entails the DC polarization (apparent DC electrical resistivity increase), permittivity (AC polarization, capacitance measurement) and DC electret (permanent electric dipole, voltage measurement). The dielectric behavior is not derived from functional admixtures such as the perovskite ceramics. The polarization involves charge-carrier polarization, with the carriers being primarily the ions in the pore solution. Dipolar polarization associated with the polar water molecules plays a minor role. Silica fume, if present, decreases the permittivity, partly due to the pore refinement. A polymer admixture, if present, increases the permittivity, with significant polarization resulting from the cement-polymer interface. Carbon fiber, if present, affects the electronic and ionic conduction, with the fiber’s ozone treatment promoting the ionic conduction and enhancing the permittivity. As the water/cement ratio increases, the permittivity increases, but the DC polarization decreases. The DC polarization occurs faster and more significantly than the subsequent depolarization. This reflects the electret, which discharges upon short circuiting (as in capacitor discharge) and subsequently charges back upon open circuiting. The temperature increases the permittivity or the electret’s electric field, whereas tension decreases the same, enabling capacitance-based/voltage-based self-sensing of temperature and stress/strain.","Dielectric properties, Electrical properties, Silicate, Sensors"

Data The literature search was conducted based on the question: “Is the use of compomers as a dental filling material more successful in the restorative treatment of decayed primary teeth than other dental filling materials?” No language restriction was applied and systematic reviews published up to May 2023 were included. The ROBIS tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews. Data were extracted for narrative synthesis, considering the restoration failure/success outcomes. Search Online search was conducted in three databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane library). Study selection The electronic search yielded a total of 779 publications. Finally, 18 systematic reviews were included in this umbrella review. Four systematic reviews presented a low risk of bias, 11 presented an unclear risk of bias and three presented a high risk of bias. Most systematic reviews presenting low risk of bias reported no difference in the success rates of compomers compared to other dental filling materials used for restoration of decayed primary teeth. Studies that found a significant difference or that made clear recommendations towards the use of compomers were commonly rated with a high risk of bias. Conclusion Compomers are similar to other dental filling materials for the placement of direct restorations in primary teeth. Clinical significance The results of this umbrella review indicate a similar clinical performance of compomers compared to other materials containing a resin component for direct restoration in primary teeth. Therefore, the choice of restorative material will depend on multiple factors, such as clinician's skills/preferences, patients’ wishes, costs, and cavity type/location.","Compomer, Primary teeth, Overview, Systematic review, Umbrella review"
