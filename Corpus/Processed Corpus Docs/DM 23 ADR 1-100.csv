Methods Two ion-releasing RBCs, Activa (ACT) and Cention-N (CN), were compared to a conventional RBC (Z350) and a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji-II-LC). Ten disk-shaped specimens were fabricated for each material (n = 40). After standardized surface polishing procedure, the surface properties of the specimens were evaluated using surface roughness measurements by a profilometer and hydrophobicity using water contact angle measurements. To assess bacterial adhesion, the number of S. mutans bacteria was calculated from colony-forming units (CFU). Confocal laser scanning microscope analysis was done for qualitative & quantitative assessment. The data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test to compare the mean values of surface roughness, water contact angle and CFU values. To compare the mean dead cell percentage Kruskal-Wallis rank test and Conover test were used. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was used to report the statistical significance. Results Z350 and ACT had the smoothest surfaces, followed by CN, and the roughest surface was seen in FUJI-II-LC. The lowest water contact angles were seen in CN, and Z350, and the highest were in ACT. S. mutans counts were the highest in ACT and the lowest in Z350 and CN. CN and Fuji-II-LC registered the highest percentage of dead bacterial cells, while the lowest were in ACT. Significance Surface properties did not significantly influence bacterial adhesion. More S. mutans bacteria accumulated on ACT than on the nanofilled composite and on CN. CN had antibacterial effects against Streptococcus mutans biofilms.","Resin composites, Ion release, Surface properties, , Confocal laser scanning microscopy"

It was suggested that CeO2 NPs could potentially have an insulin-sensitizing effect, specifically on adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. It was reported that ZnONPs combat the increase of insulin resistance observed in obese rats and could be beneficial value in NAFLD. In our previous work, ZnO-NPs manifested valuable anti-obesity effects via lowering body weight gain, oxidative stress, BMI, lipids, and insulin resistance. Methods In the present study, cerium oxide nanoparticles (A-1) and cerium/zinc nanocomposites (A-2 and A-3) were synthesized by solgel to investigate their role on oxidative stress, adipocyte hormones, and insulin resistance in an obese rat model. X-ray diffraction, HRTEM, SEM, and XPS were carried out to confirm the crystal structure, the particle size, the morphology of the nanoparticles and the oxidation states. Results The Rietveld refinement has also been executed on A-1 (chi2 = 1.00; average Bragg = 2.92%; R-factor = 2.45%) and on A-2 (Rw = 9.87%, Rex= 9.68%, χ2 = 1.04, GoF = 1.02). The XPS spectra indicated the presence of Ce in + 4 and + 3 oxidation states and Zn as ZnO and ZnO.OH. Cerium oxide and ZnO crystal sizes lie in the range 40.53–45.01 and 40.53–45.01 nm, respectively. The results indicated that treating obese rats with any of the tested nano compounds (5 mg or 10 mg/Kg) lowered plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, insulin resistance, glucose, and BMI significantly relative to obese group values. On the other hand, HDL increased significantly in obese rats after treatment with either A-2 or A-3 compared to obese rats. The current investigation showed antioxidant activities for A-1, A-2, and A3 as evidenced by the significant increase in GSH level and a significant decrease in MDA. Conclusion It was found that A-1, A-2, and A-3 have an efficient therapeutic role in treating of obesity-related hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. The results of A-2 and A-3 were more pronounced than those of A-1. The use of Zn/Ce nanocomposite (that have positive characteristics) in combating obesity and its complications could be become a new trend in therapeutic application for a management of obesity.","Cerium oxide, Cerium/zinc nanocomposites, Rietveld analysis, Oxidative stress, Obese, Insulin resistance"

Methods A total of 318 restorations which needed to be replaced were clinically and radiographically evaluated in a period of nine months. The frequencies of reasons for replacing posterior amalgam and resin composite restorations were calculated; secondary caries, restoration/tooth fracture, marginal discoloration/ditching, proximal overhang/open margin, loss of anatomy, pain/sensitivity, and esthetics. Results The sample population comprised of 191 females and 106 males. The majority of the sample population fell in the age group of 40–50 years (n = 110). 318 restorations (n = 318) were examined in this study. 82% of examined teeth were restored with amalgam (n = 261), while posterior composite restorations comprised 18% of the examined teeth (n = 57). Among all restorations demanded to be replaced by the patients (n = 318), aesthetic need was the most common reason (n = 98), followed by Ditching or discoloration (n = 64), secondary caries (n = 57), and fracture (n = 44). Loss of anatomy was the least common cause to replace both amalgam and resin composite restorations (n = 5). The different reasons of failure were all significant between amalgam and resin composite restorations as shown in (Fig. 1) (p < 0.005). The most common reason for amalgam replacement was aesthetic. The most common reason for composite replacement was secondary caries and marginal ditching. Conclusion Both amalgam and composite had different reasons for replacement. Amalgam had lesser risk of developing secondary caries and higher longevity than composite.","Resin composite, Amalgam, Recurrent caries, Fracture, Aesthetics"

Methods A 14-item validated survey questionnaire was mailed to directors/coordinators of operative/restorative dentistry teachers of Brazilian Dental Schools. Data were collected on demographic characteristics of the teachers and institutions, together with questions on the teaching of the repair of defective resin-based composite restorations as part of the school curriculum; the rationale behind the teaching; the nature of the teaching (preclinical and/or clinical); how techniques were taught, indications for repair, operative techniques, materials used, patient acceptability and expected longevity of completed repairs. Results Two hundred and twenty-two (94%) directors/ coordinators of dental curricula in Brazil were contacted. One hundred and thirty-one directors/coordinators (59%) replied, providing the e-mail address from the teacher responsible for the operative/restorative dentistry program in their school. Of these, 104 responded to the questionnaire (79% response rate). Ninety-three (89%) of the participating schools reported teaching composite repairs as an alternative to replacing restorations. Of the theoretical content, 43% was taught at preclinical and clinical levels, whereas most practical experience (53%) was acquired at clinical levels. Eighty-eight schools (95%) reported tooth substance preservation being the main reason for teaching repair techniques. All schools that taught repairs reported high patient acceptability. Conclusions The teaching of composite restoration repair as an alternative to restoration replacement is established in undergraduate programs in most of the Brazilian dental schools surveyed. Clinical significance The reasons for teaching restoration repair in Brazil were found to be quite unanimous among teachers, especially regarding the preservation of tooth structure.

While it ultimately failed to liberate Slovakia, the narrative of the Slovak National Uprising of 1944 become central to the Slovak memory wars which have followed. Virtually all post-war political regimes have sought either to uphold the legacy of the uprising or to attack it as an anti-state action. Such memory wars extend to monumental commemorations of the uprising—most notable is Jozef Jankovič’s 1969 monument entitled 'Victims Warn'. The monument’s surreal, humanistic style and counter-monumental social message offended communist sensibilities and it was quickly removed. Since its restoration to the central courtyard of the Slovak National Uprising Museum in 2004, it now increasingly functions as an anti-monument to nationalist political narratives, including those related to NATO, Russia, Ukraine, and the legacy of the wartime Slovak state. This paper tracks the monument’s transition from counter-monument to anti-monument, and also looks at commemorative vigilance issues that currently threaten to alter the monument’s original meaning, its spatial context, and Jankovič’s original artistic vision.","Slovak National Uprising, Counter monument, Anti monument, Slovakia, Ukraine, Lieu de mémoire"

Methods Here, the refractive-index-matched monodisperse SiO2 were used as the supporting substrates to synthesize GO-cladded SiO2 spheres (xSiO2 @ yGO) through a mild electrostatic self-assembly process, where x and y represent the amount of SiO2 and GO in the reaction mixture, respectively. The morphology and the optical performance of the obtained xSiO2 @ yGO particles were modulated by varying the mass ratio of SiO2 and GO (5:1, 10:1, 50:1, and 100:1). All developed hybrid particles were silanized and formulated with dimethacrylate-based resins. These were tested for curing depth, polymerization conversion, mechanical performance, in vitro cell viability, and antibacterial activity. Results Of all xSiO2 @ yGO materials, increasing the mass ratio to 100:1 made the 100SiO2 @GO particles appear light brown and possess the lowest light absorbance from 300 to 800 nm. The results of CIEL*a*b* system showed that all these hybrid particles exhibited obvious discoloration compared with SiO2 and GO, where 100SiO2 @GO possessed the smallest color difference. Furthermore, following the results of curing depth, polymerization conversion, and mechanical performance of dental composites, the optimal filler composition was 100SiO2 @GO at 5 wt% filler loading. The resultant 100SiO2 @GO-filled composite produced the highest flexural strength (115 ± 12 MPa) and the lowest bacterial concentration (6.7 × 108 CFU/mL) than those of the resin matrix (78 ± 11 MPa; 9.2 × 108 CFU/mL) and 5 wt% SiO2-filled composite (106 ± 9 MPa; 9.1 × 108 CFU/mL), respectively, without affecting in vitro cell viability. Significance The facile and mild synthesis of xSiO2 @ yGO hybrid particles provided a convenient way to tune their optical property. The optimal 100SiO2 @GO particles could be considered as the promising antibacterial filler to be applied in dental care and therapy.","Refractive index-matched, Optical characteristic, Antibacterial property, Dental resin composite"

An antibacterial composite resin containing quaternary ammonium silica (QASi) filler has been reported to inhibit enamel demineralization in situ. However, whether the prevention of enamel demineralization by QASi-containing composite resin is because of the reduced metabolic activity of acid-producing saliva bacteria is unclear. Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of QASi-containing composite resin and 2 other restorative materials on the viability of salivary bacteria and sugar-induced acid production. Material and methods Whole saliva from each of the 30 study participants, 14 at high risk and 16 at low risk for caries, was brought into contact with quadruplicate specimens of 3 restorative materials, Infinix Flowable Composite, an anti-bacterial composite resin containing 1.5% QASi filler (Nobio), Filtek Supreme Flowable Restorative (3M), a conventional flowable composite resin, and dental amalgam (Silmet). Bacterial growth and sugar-induced acid production on each restorative material were measured every 20 minutes for 18 hours. Caries risk groups were compared using the t test and repeated measures analysis of variance (α=.05). When significant, Bonferroni multiple comparisons were used. Results On average, the saliva with the QASi-containing composite resin specimens maintained a near-neutral pH, not dropping below pH 6.0. The saliva associated with both conventional restorative materials exhibited a pH drop below 5.5 (P<.001), the critical threshold for tooth demineralization according to the Stephan curve. Virtually no growth was measured on the surface of the antibacterial composite resin, whereas bacteria grew on the conventional composite resin and dental amalgam (P<.001). No differences were observed between participants at high and low risk of caries. Conclusions Unlike amalgam and conventional composite resin, the QASi-containing composite resin showed a near-complete shutdown of the metabolic activity of salivary bacteria upon contact and virtually no bacterial viability. This suggests that the prevention of tooth demineralization by QASi-containing restoratives is associated with a significant reduction in bacterial metabolic activity.",

Methods Patients (n = 91) receiving LidiSi (73.1%) and RBC (36.9%) inlays/onlays/overlays between 2007 and 2017 were selected. The restorations were evaluated using the modified U.S. Public Health Service criteria. The survival of the restorations was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. Factors affecting the occurrence of deficiencies were examined by logistic regression analysis. This was performed with the use of the Generalized Estimating Equation model including Repeated measurements (GEER), with the consideration that the same patient had several teeth in the sample. Risk estimation was conducted for each evaluated criterion (p < 0.05). Results The survival of LidiSi and RBC restorations were 96.8% and 84.9%, respectively after a mean observation period of 7.8 ± 3.3 years. The annual failure rate was 0.2% for LidiSi and 1.0% for RBC. The probability of survival was above 98% for both restorations in the first 6 years, however, it dropped to 60% for RBC by the end of the 15th year. For both materials the reasons for failure included secondary caries, restoration fracture, and endodontic complication. In addition, LidiSi also failed due to tooth fracture, while RBC due to marginal gap formation and loss of retention. Among the evaluated risk factors, material of restoration (OR=6.8, CI95%:3.1–14.9), oral hygiene (OR=8.0, CI95%: 2.9–22.1], and bruxism (OR=1.9, CI95%: 1.1–3.3) showed a significant impact on the evaluated criteria. Significance LidiSi and RBC restorations showed similarly excellent 6-year survival, however, in the long term significantly more failures should be expected for RBCs.","Lithium disilicate, Resin composite, Indirect restoration, Clinical performance"

Traditional dentistry is expensive, invasive and relies on an outmoded mechanical understanding of dental disease, rather than employing a biological perspective that harnesses cell activity and the regenerative-capacity. Recent research has focussed on developing minimally-invasive biologically-based ‘fillings’ that preserve the dental pulp; research that is shifting the paradigm from expensive high-technology dentistry, with high failure rates, to smart restorations targeted at biological processes. Current VPTs promote repair by recruiting odontoblast-like cells in a material-dependent process. Therefore, exciting opportunities exist for development of next-generation biomaterials targeted at regenerative processes in the dentin-pulp complex. This article analyses recent research using pharmacological-inhibitors to therapeutically-target histone-deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes in dental-pulp-cells (DPCs) that stimulate pro-regenerative effects with limited loss of viability. Consequently, HDAC-inhibitors have the potential to enhance biomaterial-driven tissue responses at low concentration by influencing the cellular processes with minimal side-effects, providing an opportunity to develop a topically-placed, inexpensive bio-inductive pulp-capping material. Despite positive results, clinical translation of these innovations requires enterprise to counteract regulatory obstacles, dental-industry priorities and to develop strong academic/industry partnerships. The aim of this opinion-led review paper is to discuss the potential role of therapeutically-targeting epigenetic modifications as part of a topical VPT strategy in the treatment of the damaged dental pulp, while considering the next steps, material considerations, challenges and future for the clinical development of epigenetic therapeutics or other ‘smart’ restorations in VPT.","Epigenetics, Vital pulp treatment, Histone deacetylase inhibitors, Regenerative endodontics, Pulp capping"

Methods and Materials Rectangular cross sectioned dentin hemisections (N = 60, n = 15 per group; >7 × 4 × 1.2 mm) were prepared using extracted third molars. After cleansing and storage in artificial saliva, random distribution was performed to 2 irradiation settings, namely AB or CD (A, 30 single doses of irradiation [2 Gy each] for 6 weeks; B, control group of A; C, 3 single doses of irradiation [9 Gy each]; and D, control group of C). Various parameters (fracture strength/maximal force, flexural strength, and elasticity modulus) were assessed using a universal Testing Machine (ZwickRoell). The effect of irradiation on dentin morphology was evaluated by histology, scanning electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way analysis of variance and paired and unpaired t tests at a significance level of 5%. Results Significance could be found considering the maximal force applied to failure when the irradiated groups were compared with their control groups (A/B, P < .0001; C/D, P = .008). Flexural strength was significantly higher in the irradiated group A compared with control group B (P < .001) and for the irradiated groups A and C (P = .022) compared with each other. Cumulative radiation with low irradiation doses (30 single doses; 2 Gy) and single irradiation with high doses (3 single doses; 9 Gy) make the tooth substance more prone to fracture, lowering the maximal force. The flexural strength decreases when cumulative irradiation is applied, but not after single irradiation. The elasticity modulus showed no alteration after irradiation treatment. Conclusions Irradiation therapy affects the prospective adhesion of dentin and the bond strength of future restorations, potentially leading to an increased risk of tooth fracture and retention loss in dental reconstructions.",

Data The following were extracted: study design, sample characteristics, source of teeth, name of restorations compared including controls, recurrent caries model type, type of demineralizing and remineralizing solutions, type of biofilm used, methods to detect recurrent caries. Sources Literature searches were performed in OVID Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library. Study selection For a study to be included, it had to examine dental materials for tooth restoration purposes only with a valid control group and evaluate restorative dental materials regardless of the form of the teeth caries model used or nature of the tooth structure used. A total of 91 studies were included. Most of the studies presented were in vitro. Human teeth were the main source of specimens utilized. Around 88% of the studies used specimens without an artificial gap, and 44% used a chemical model. S. mutans was the main bacterial species used in microbial caries models. Conclusion The findings of this review provided an insight into the performance of available dental materials assessed using different recurrent caries models, yet this review cannot be used as a guideline for material selection. Selecting the appropriate restorative material relies on several patient-related factors such as microbiota, occlusion, and diet that are not comprehensively taken into consideration in recurrent caries models and thus hinder reliable comparison. Clinical Significance Due to the heterogenicity of variables among studies on the performance of dental restorative materials, this scoping review aimed to provide insights for dental researchers concerning the available recurrent caries models, testing methods used, and aspects of comparison between these materials including their characteristics and limitations.","Antibacterial agents, Bioactive, Composite resins, Tooth remineralization, Recurrent caries, Dental materials, Nanoparticles"

Material and methods Human molars (N = 64) were randomly assigned to four different preparation designs: Undermined Inlay (UI), Extended Inlay (EI), Restricted Overlay (RO), and Extended Overlay (EO). The teeth were restored using lithium disilicate partial restorations and subjected to thermomechanical fatigue in a chewing simulator (1,2 × 10 (Mondelli et al., 2007) cycles on 50 N, 8000x 5–55 °C), followed by load to failure testing. In silico finite element analysis was conducted to assess tooth deformation. Polymerization-induced cracks were evaluated using optical microscopy and transillumination. Fracture strengths were statistically analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test, while the failure mode, repairability, and polymerization cracks were analyzed using Fisher exact test. Results The propagation of polymerization-induced cracks did not significantly differ among preparation designs. All specimens withstood chewing simulator fatigue, with no visible cracks in teeth or restorations. Fracture strength was significantly influenced by preparation design, with restricted overlay (RO) showing higher fracture strength compared to extended inlay (EI) (p = .042). Tooth deformation and fracture resistance correlated between in vitro and in silico analyses). UI exhibited a statistically less destructive failure pattern than EO (p < .01) and RO (p = .036). No statistically significant influence of the preparation design on repairability was observed. Groups with higher repairability rates experienced increased tooth deformation, leading to less catastrophic failures. Conclusions The preparation design affected the fracture strength of compromised molars restored with lithium disilicate inlays and overlays, with significantly lower fracture strength for an extended inlay. The failure pattern of lithium disilicate overlays is significantly more destructive than that of undermined and extended inlays. The finite element analysis showed more tooth deformation in the inlay restorations, with lower forces in the roots, leading to less destructive fractures. Since cusp coverage restorations fracture in a more destructive manner, this study suggests the undermined inlay preparation design as a viable option for restoring weakened cusps.","Adhesion, Ceramic, Dental materials, Fracture strength, Cusp coverage, Lithium disilicate, Inlay, Overlay, Failure mode, Fatigue, Adhesive dentistry, FEA"

Methods Eighty-four intact maxillary premolars were taken, and endodontic treatment was performed followed by MOD cavity preparations (except in the control group). They were distributed into 7 groups based on type of restoration: intact teeth (control group), ETP + MOD (not restored), NHC, FRC + NHC, HFP + NHC, FRC + HFP + NHC, and CI groups. Samples were subjected to universal testing machine until the fracture occurred and failure mode was visually inspected. Results Mean and standard deviation of fracture resistance of the 7 groups ranged from 265.6 ± 68.0 N to 1023.7 ± 76.5 N. The highest reading was noted for intact teeth followed by FRC + HFP + NHC group and then the CI group, with no significant difference among the 3 groups. The lowest reading was noted for the ETP + MOD group. Maximum unrepairable fractures were seen in the ETP + MOD and CI groups.

Methods Teeth with pulp exposure due to advanced caries and clinical diagnosis of reversible pulpitis were treated by direct pulp capping. Treatments were conducted over a period of 15 years by a single operator. Under magnification, caries was completely removed, the exposed pulp examined, and capped with either pure calcium hydroxide or a calcium hydroxide-based cement. The cavity was restored and the long-term outcome evaluated from 1 to >35 years. Teeth that were asymptomatic, responded to sensibility pulp tests within normal limits, and showed no radiographic periapical changes were categorized as success. Teeth with no response to pulp tests and/or showing radiographic evidence of apical periodontitis were classified as failures. The effects of independent variables (sex, age, symptoms, number and size of pulp exposures, bleeding time, capping material, bases used over the capping material, and final coronal restoration) on the outcome were evaluated. Results In general, 225 teeth from 148 patients were available for follow-up examination in at least one of the evaluated periods. The success rate of the direct pulp capping procedure was 100%, 95%, 95%, 86%, and 89% at 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 35-year follow-up examination, respectively. The main variable significantly affecting the treatment outcome in all follow-up periods was the quality/presence of coronal restoration (P < .001). Other isolated variables associated with the outcome included the size and number of pulp exposures at the 20-year follow-up, and the exposure size, capping material, and restoration type at the 35-year follow-up. Multiple regression analysis confirmed the results for exposure size (P < .05), and disclosed a higher proportion of failures at 5 years when varnish was used as the base. Conclusions A very high success rate of the direct pulp capping with calcium hydroxide was observed, especially in the first 10 years following treatment. The main variable influencing the outcome was the quality of the coronal restoration.","Caries, direct pulp capping, outcome, vital pulp therapy"

However, little is known about the tooth-colored restorative materials for decayed teeth in Taiwan. In this study, the use of composite resin, glass ionomer cement, and compomer was analyzed by National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Materials and methods A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the registered database compiled by Taiwanese NHIRD from 1997 to 2013. The results were further to analyze the application of tooth-colored restorative materials by sex and age. In addition, time trends of dental visits for each tooth-colored restorative material were also investigated.

Background Cracks are a common clinical finding in teeth and yet clinicians still struggle to identify the full extent and orientation of cracks for their appropriate timely management. The biomechanics of crack development can be due to multiple factors and can differ from an unrestored tooth to a restored or endodontically treated tooth. Data & sources This narrative review has been designed following the guidelines published by Green et al. 2006 [1] Published literature in the English language that addresses the objectives of this review up to July 2022 was sourced from online databases and reference lists. The relevance of the papers was assessed and discussed by two reviewers. A total of 101 publications were included in this narrative review. Conclusions The initiation and development of cracks in teeth are likely linked to an interplay between the masticatory forces and fracture resistance of the remaining tooth structure. From the identified literature, the quality and quantity of remaining tooth structure in a restored or endodontically-treated tooth affects the biomechanics of crack development compared to an unrestored tooth. The extent, orientation, and size of the cracks do affect a clinician's ability to detect cracks in teeth. There is still a need to develop reliable diagnostic tools that will accurately identify cracks in teeth beneath restorations to enable effective monitoring of their propagation and provide appropriate interventions. Clinical significance The development and propagation of cracks in an unrestored tooth differ greatly from a restored and endodontically treated tooth; mainly linked to the quantity and quality of the remaining tooth structure and the forces acting on them. Identifying the extent of cracks in teeth remains challenging for early clinical intervention.","Cracked tooth, Fractured tooth, Cracked tooth syndrome, Dental crack propagation"

Methods Four finite element analysis models were designed and built up based on different endocrown configurations in a mandibular molar. One model was designed as a butt joint preparation with 2 mm occlusal thickness(control), the other three models were butt joint designs with different distances between the bottom of the mesial wall preparation and the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ): 2 mm, 1 mm and 0 mm respectively. A vertical load parallel with the longitudinal axis of the tooth and an oblique load with a 45°angle to the longitudinal axis were applied to the occlusal surfaces. The maximum Von Misses (VM) stresses and stress distribution patterns were calculated and compared. Weibull risk-of-rupture analysis was used to analyze the survival probability of the restorations and tooth in the different models. Results For the restoration, the model with a mesial wall destruction at the level of CEJ showed much higher risk of failure than other models. Overall, none of the four models showed failure. Under oblique loading, VM stress in the cement layer of the models with a mesial wall defect was higher than in the control model. In the dentin, the highest VM stresses were found in the peri-cervical dentin. Under the oblique loading, the model with the mesial wall destruction at the level of CEJ restored by endocrown showed the highest risk of failure. Conclusion Under the oblique loading, with the increase of the simulated defect in the mesial wall, the peak VM stress values in the cement layer increased accordingly. In the model with a mesial wall defect up to the level of CEJ risk of failure was highest in the cervical dentin.","Fracture strength, Endocrown, Stress, Finite element analysis"

Methods The study involved repairing 130 Class I and II defective composite restorations. After recurrent caries removal, the repair process included etching with 37 % phosphoric acid, Adper Single Bond 2 application for bonding and Filtek Z250 composite for restoring all defects. The restoration surfaces were subjected to one of the following additional surface treatments within the repair process: Control: No additional treatment; the Silane-Adhesive treatment: A separate step involved the application of a silane coupling agent after acid etching; and the Sandblast-Silane-Adhesive treatment: included intra-oral sandblasting of old composite surfaces followed by silane application. Two calibrated examiners evaluated all repaired restorations according to a modified USPHS criteria after 6 months. Comparisons of the clinical performance between the treatment groups were made using Chi-square test, while responses to cold tests before and after repair treatment were made using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank's (α = 0.05). Results Of 130 cases, only 116 cases turned up for evaluation. The primary reasons for composite repair were recurrent caries and anatomical deficiencies. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for all clinical criteria (p > 0.05). The control group experienced one total and two partial retention losses. Conclusions The application of a silane coupling agent, with or without intra-oral sandblasting, demonstrated no improvement on the clinical performance of repaired posterior composites after 6-months. Clinical significance Surface treatment of defective composite restorations using silane with intra-oral sandblasting within their repair process offered marginal improvement in their clinical performance over conventional etching technique, but insignificantly so. Repair reduced exaggerated cold test responses and eliminated POS within 6-months. Repair reduces cold sensitivity and promotes restoration longevity.

Study selection Quantitative studies reporting on dental schools’ teaching regarding the placement of PCRs in permanent teeth. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were performed. Risk of bias was assessed based on the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). Sources Electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched in January 2023. Data Forty sources reporting on 34 studies having surveyed 1,286 dental schools were included. Overall, 92.7% (95%-CI: 88.2-95.5) of dental schools reported to teach PCRs. PCRs in three-surface Class II cavities are taught by 82.0% (95%-CI: 70.4-89.7). The mandatory use of liners in deep cavities is taught by 78.3% (95%-CI: 68.9-85.5), and 44.0% (95%-CI: 34.3-54.2) reported to teach bulk-fill composites. While most posterior restorations placed by students were composites (56.1%; 95%-CI: 46.0-65.8), 94.7% (95%-CI: 86.6-98.0) of dental schools (still) teach posterior amalgam restorations. The proportion of dental schools teaching PCRs in three-surface Class II cavities increased and the mean proportion of PCRs among all posterior restorations increased over time (padj.≤0.003). Conclusions The teaching of PCRs in dental schools around the world reflects the increased use of resin composite in clinical practice, with students in countries where dental amalgam continues to be used, placing more posterior composites than restorations of dental amalgam. The teaching of PCRs, which is anticipated to increase, will continue to be refined with further developments in adhesive materials, devices, instrumentation, and techniques.

It also aimed to assess the association of type and quality of coronal restorations and periapical disease. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. To be included, participants needed to have at least 1 non–root-filled tooth restored with either direct or indirect restoration. A sample of 491 participants was examined. Clinical examination and digital periapical radiographs were used to record material used and assess the quality of the restorations. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyse the association between PAS and gender, age, restoration material/type, and quality. Results Overall, 26.3% of the participants were diagnosed with apical periodontitis (AP) on 1 or more of the examined teeth. No significant differences in the prevalence of AP were observed when comparing amalgam to composite or indirect restorations (P = .386). Furthermore, no association was reported between AP and gender or age, while a significant association was observed with the restoration's quality (P < .001). Conclusions The high prevalence of AP in the examined sample is of clinical concern and suggests that more attention should be directed towards dental health awareness in Jordan.

The aim of this research investigation is to determine, through a comparative cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment, the environmental impacts of three direct-placement dental restorative materials (DRMs) and their associated packaging. Methods Three direct-placement dental materials; dental amalgam, resin-based composite (RBC) and glass polyalkenoate cements (GIC) are assessed using primary data from a manufacturer (SDI Limited, Australia). The functional unit consisted of ‘one dental restoration’ of each restorative system under investigation: 1.14 g of dental amalgam; 0.25 g of RBC (plus the adhesive = 0.10 g); and 0.54 g of GIC. The system boundary per restoration included the raw materials and their associated packaging materials for each DRM together with the processing steps for both the materials and packaging. The environmental impacts were assessed using an Egalitarian approach under the ReCiPe method using Umberto software and the Ecoinvent database. Nine different impact categories were used to compare the environmental performance of these materials. Results Dental amalgam had the highest impact across most of the categories, but RBC had the highest Global Warming Potential. The highest sources of the environmental impacts for each restorative material were: Amalgam, derived from material use; RBC, derived from energy use in processing material and packaging material; GIC, derived from material and energy use for packaging. Significance Less intensive energy sources or more sustainable packaging materials can potentially reduce the impacts associated with RBC and GIC thus making them suitable alternatives to dental amalgam.","Environmental impacts, LCA, Dental amalgam, Dental composite, Glass ionomer cement, Dental materials, Sustainability"

We seek to achieve this goal through a comprehensive investigation of three primary factors: (1) the choice of restoration material properties, (2) internal cavity geometries, and (3) the impact of double-layered restoration configurations. Methods To achieve our objectives, we initiated by creating two-dimensional (2D) models of restored teeth featuring class II OD cavities, utilizing scanned and segmented images of maxillary molar teeth. We drew 2D profiles of dentine and enamel, which were then imported into finite element analysis (FEA) software. To explore various cavity geometries, we implemented a total of thirteen different designs, encompassing straight, oblique, grooved, curved, and double-layered configurations. We utilized a semi-circular stone to simulate the application of contact load on the restored tooth. We applied identical boundary conditions and contact loading across all models. To assign material properties, we developed a Python code, enabling the automatic assignment of seven elastic moduli ranging from 2 GPa to 26 GPa to the restoration materials. Meanwhile, constant material properties were assigned to the enamel and dentine. In total, we conducted 133 FEA simulations to comprehensively analyse the effects of the aforementioned factors on the strength and performance of restored molar teeth. Results Our analysis revealed two key factors significantly influencing the mechanical resistance of treated teeth, particularly in the presence of a crack or debonding: (1) the marginal geometry of the OD cavity and (2) the elastic modulus of the restorative material. However, altering the internal cavity angle and implementing a double-layered restoration did not significantly influence the restored tooth's overall strength and performance in the face of crack or debonding situations. Significance The findings of this study have substantial implications for designing and restoring class II OD cavities to enhance resistance to cracks or debonding. The use of curved marginal geometries in restoration design can significantly improve fracture resistance, with double-curved geometries reducing stress concentrations by approximately 43% compared to straight cavities. These results offer valuable guidance for strengthening the structural integrity of restored teeth, calling for further experimental investigations to explore practical applications and benefits.","Dental restoration geometry, Mechanical resistance, Finite element method, Maximum principal stress, Interfacial crack"

Through the strategic process of 'Indicator Articulation - Weight Calibration - Nexus Coordination Quantification - Correlational Analysis', this work has developed a tailored framework that integrates a novel, context-specific indicator system, enabling an illumination of the intricate dynamics within the WEFE nexus in arid regions. During 2000–2018, the WEFE Nexus in Uzbekistan showed low-level coordination, indicating systemic imbalances. The Aral Sea crisis was the central disruptor, resulting in a moderately disordered ecological subsystem. Concurrently, disorder was observed in water resources, signaling inadequate management and potential overutilization. Furthermore, Coordination for energy and food were barely coordinated and under primary coordination respectively, underlining critical challenges in energy efficiency and food security. Over the last two decades, the WEFE Nexus has evolved towards a tighter interlinkage, yet the stability of this coupling coordination has experienced increased fluctuations, indicating that Uzbekistan's policies in the WEFE subsystems have been less stable in the last two decades and are in need of further adjustment and improvement. To address the challenges, we recommend a comprehensive approach that integrates technological, infrastructure, and policy solutions is needed. Specifically, promoting water-saving irrigation technology, renewing and maintaining outdated energy facilities, and raising public awareness of ecological protection are part of the essential measures. Furthermore, alleviating the contradiction between economic growth and ecological conservation remains a major challenge. Collectively, our constructed WEFE Nexus framework, with its extendable and context-specific indicators, holds significant potential for broad application in the analysis of multi-sectoral sustainability, particularly within arid regions globally, and forms a solid foundation for the formulation of effective, targeted policies and sustainable development strategies.","Central asia, Uzbekistan, Coupling coordination degree model, Water-energy-food-ecology nexus, Correlation, Sustainable development"

Metal ions are essential in an assortment of industries, as well as human biological functions and metabolism, so their detection and monitoring for everyday applications have garnered a lot of attention. AuNP-based sensors are expected to transform the practicalities of sensing and detecting various metal ions due to their tunable surface features. In this short review article, we focus on the application of AuNPs-based nanocomposites in metal ion sensing by employing spectrometry and electrochemical techniques. Additionally, a brief description of computational studies on the interaction of AuNPs-based composites with metal ions, biomolecules, and drugs has also been presented. Finally, we discussed the benefits and drawbacks of AuNPs-based sensors for the analyte of interest sensing using these methodologies, as well as future research possibilities.","AuNPs, Synthesis, Surface modification, Metal ion, Fluorescence, Electrochemical"

This in vitro study explored the influence of factors related to dentists and patients on the management decision of occlusal noncavitated caries lesions in children. Materials and methods Five investigators in the specialties of dental public health (DPH), paediatric, prosthetic, and operative dentistry and a general dentist (GDP) participated in this study. Initially, the investigators were asked to independently assess the occlusal surfaces of 175 noncavitated permanent molars and choose a management recommendation using 2 caries risk patients’ scenarios. After 1 month, investigators were trained and calibrated to use the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) scoring system. Then, they examined the same teeth, recorded the highest/worst ICDAS score, and chose a management recommendation. Two weeks later, the investigators repeated the teeth examination using magnification loupes and again chose a management recommendation. The teeth were sectioned to study the relationship between the presence of caries and the management recommendations. Results For the low– and the high–caries risk scenarios, ICDAS training increased the operative intervention by 20% to 27% and 14% to 22%, respectively, for both the GDP and the paediatric dentist (P < .0001). For the low–caries risk scenario, using the magnifying loupes increased the operative recommendations for the DPH, GDP, and the operative dentist by 5% to 23% (P < .05). Compared to the low–caries risk scenario, teeth for patients with high caries risk received more surgical interventions (9%-30%) at all examination conditions for the GDP and the paediatric and operative dentists (P < .0001). Conclusions For occlusal noncavitated caries lesions, enhancing dentists’ caries detection skills had a significant impact on decisions of surgical intervention. This also influenced the appropriateness of the treatment recommended for the different caries risk groups.","Dental caries, Clinical decision-making, Caries risk, Caries management"

Regenerative endodontics aims to regenerate the damaged “pulp-like” tissue, which can preserve the teeth' vitality and sensitivity while avoiding necrosis. The main clinical benefit is root maturation. The “pulp-like” tissue does not refer to regenerated pulp tissue with an odontoblastic layer or the formation of pulp-dentin complexes. The cell homing technique is built on endogenous stem cells and their capacity to regenerate tissue. Cell homing refers to endogenous cells’ migration or infiltration into the cite when stimulated by physiochemical or biological stimuli or by passive flow with a blood clot from the apical tissue. Its Regenerative Endodontic Procedures success criteria are defined by the American Association of Endodontists. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of vital pulp tissue and various strategies to promote regeneration of damaged pulp tissue. The cell homing technique will be reviewed through clinical trials. Methods We performed a comprehensive literature review on a total of nine clinical trials of regenerative endodontics using the cell-homing technique based on three databases and duplicate manuscripts were removed. Results Regenerative endodontics using the cell-homing technique shows promising results that can be translated into clinical practice. However, a favorable result was observed in immature teeth, and the results are contradictory in mature teeth. Conclusion Regeneration therapy is an attractive new alternative to conventional endodontic treatments. Preservation of vitality and continuation of root development in damaged teeth would be a clear advantage.","Biomaterials, cell homing technique, growth factors, pulp tissues, regenerative endodontic, scaffolds, stem cells"

Two different adhesive systems were used: etch-&-rinse (ER) or self-etch (SE). Methods Posterior dental teeth of 72 participants (n = 236), with a cavity depth of at least 3 mm, were randomly divided into four groups. Restorations were applied with either Tetric N-Bond or Tetric N-Bond SE. The composite resin Tetric N-Ceram Bulk-Fill was placed either with IF or BF. Restorations were evaluated using FDI criteria at baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon Signed rank test (a=0.05). Results Two hundred and four restorations were evaluated after 5 years. Eleven restorations were considered 'failed', ten due to fracture (4 IF and 6 BF) and one due to secondary caries (IF). The annual failure rate was 1.2% for BF and 1% for IF (p = 0.35). When comparing BF and IF, no significant differences were found for any of the parameters evaluated (p > 0.05). Regarding the adhesive systems, 44 and 51 restorations showed minor problems in terms of marginal adaptation and staining, with significantly more marginal discoloration when the self-etch adhesive was used (p = 0.002). Significance The bulk-fill restorative technique showed good clinical behavior compared to the incremental filling technique, especially when using an etch-&-rinse adhesive, after 5 years of clinical evaluation.","Resin composite, Incremental filling technique, Bulk-fill, Self-etch, Etch-&-rinse, Postoperative sensitivity, Randomized controlled trial"

Methods Thirty noncarious human molar teeth were used. Class V cavities (3 × 5 mm) were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of each tooth. Clearfil SE Bond 2 was applied to all the cavities and then the teeth were divided into 3 groups (n = 10) as follows: group 1–restored with N-Flow composite; group 2 and group 3–restored with N-Flow composite mixed with different zMgO nanoparticle concentrations (0.3% and 0.5% by weight, respectively) and then light cured using an LED curing device. Specimens were examined for interfacial adaptation examination under CP-OCT. Characterisation of the dental composite incorporating zMgO was done by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Results were analysed with Kruskall–Wallis test followed by Mann–Whitney U test, at a significance level of P < .05. Results XRD spectra exhibited the sharp peaks of zMgO in the composite enhanced with zMgO nanoparticles. FESEM analysis showed a uniform distribution of the zMgO nanoparticles in the composite and FTIR illustrated no change in the spectra. The gap percentage along the cavity floor was significantly lower in groups 2 and 3 in comparison to group 1 (P < .05). Also there was a significant difference in gap percentages between groups 2 and 3 (P < .05), with group 3 showing the lowest gap percentage. Conclusions The incorporation of 0.3% and 0.5% zMgO nanoparticles in flowable composite assists in improving the internal adaptation of the composite to the tooth surface.","Magnesium oxide, Nanoparticles, Dental composite, Microleakage, OCT"

Clinical evaluation was performed by blinded evaluators according to FDI criteria. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis and an intergroup comparison (Mann-Whitney-U-Test) was carried out. A basic significance level of 0.05 was corrected by the Bonferroni method to account for multiple testing (significance after correction: p<0.00067). Results The mean overall survival of restorations was 92% after 56.98±1.51 months in the TEST group (95 CI= 54.02;59.94) and 92% after 57.25±1.46 months (95 CI= 54.39; 60.12) in the CONTROL group (log-rank p=0.995). In total, four failures occurred in both TEST and CONTROL group during the observation period (mean annual failure rate: 1.6%). The most common reasons for failure were chipping-fractures, debonding, cracked-tooth-syndrome and recurrent decay. With regard to the FDI criteria, no significant differences between TEST and CONTROL material occurred for any of the evaluated variables. In the TEST group two restorations had to be repaired and two had to be replaced, in the CONTROL group four restorations had to be replaced. Conclusion Both materials showed acceptable clinical performance and survival during the 5-year observation period.

This study investigated the effect of two different nano-additive materials, namely aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), on the mechanical, wear, and water sorption/solubility behavior of a commercial restorative composite used in dental treatments (Nexcomp Flow A2). The results showed that dental materials containing the introduced nano-fillers have a higher wear resistance than their neat counterparts. Correspondingly, the average diametral tensile strength values were improved from a value of 14.6 MPa to values of 26.6 MPa and 50.8 MPa when reinforced with TiO2 and Al2O3, respectively. It has been found that there is a significant relationship between the improvements in wear resistance and tensile strength due to the addition of nano-additives. Further, the water sorption/solubility of the pure composite was lower by 60% after introducing 1% wt. Al2O3 and by more than 80% when 1%wt. TiO2 was the reinforcement additive. Scanning electron microscope images of the tested samples on worn and unworn surfaces showed that the nano-additives helped carry the load subjected to the surface. After introducing nano-additives into the matrix, surface degradation, which may occur due to water uptake, was suppressed.","Restorative materials, Tribology, Wear, Additives, Resin composite, Nanoparticles"

Purpose The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that restoration placement with the adhesive 4-methacryloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride/methyl methacrylate-tributylborane (4-META/MMA-TBB) resin cement is associated with better longevity of teeth than zinc phosphate cement up to 43 years. Materials and methods Study participants were individuals who had been visiting the clinic regularly for more than 20 years from their first visit between November 1970 and April 1985. The vital teeth with prosthetic restorations (N=454), including cast inlays, onlays, crowns, and fixed partial dentures, of 53 patients were assessed from dental charts and radiographs. Most of the bonding surfaces were precious metal alloy, excluding 4 restorations cemented with zinc phosphate and 6 ceramic crowns cemented with 4-META/MMA-TBB resin cement. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test (α=.05) were used to compare longevity between the 2 materials. Chi-squared tests (α=.001) were also used to examine the occurrence rates of events such as secondary caries, endodontic treatment, and the dislodgement of restorations affecting the longevity of the 2 cements. Results Clinical review examination demonstrated that 55.4% of teeth retained with 4-META/MMA-TBB resin cement had been in service for 30 years compared with 43.5% of those retained with zinc phosphate cement, with a significant difference (P=.006). 4-META/MMA-TBB resin cement also demonstrated lower event occurrence rates than zinc phosphate cement for 3 assessed types of events (P<.001).

Purpose The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to assess the long-term incidence of teeth requiring endodontic therapy after receiving either complete or partial coverage glass-ceramic restorations. Material and methods Participants requiring single anterior complete, posterior complete, or posterior partial (inlay or onlay) coverage restoration, or a combination of these on a vital tooth were recruited from a clinical private practice. Only the participants who chose glass-ceramic partial and complete coverage restorations without the need of endodontic therapy were included in the study. The overall clinical performance of these glass-ceramic restorations was assessed by clinical factors determined at recall. The effect of various clinical parameters (type of restoration, dental arch, tooth position in the dental arch, age and sex of participant, and ceramic thickness) was evaluated by using Kaplan–Meier survival curves to account for attrition bias and other reasons for failure. The statistical significance of differences between parameters was determined by using the log rank test (α=.05). Results A total of 1800 participants requiring 4511 glass-ceramic anterior and posterior restorations were evaluated. The mean age of the participants at the time of restoration placement was 62 (range 20 to 99 years, 710 men and 1090 women). Of 4511 restorations, 1476 were anterior complete coverage, 2119 posterior complete coverage, and 916 posterior partial coverage. Endodontic therapy after restoration placement was needed for 76 restorations (10 anterior complete, 50 posterior complete, and 16 posterior partial). The total time at risk was 50 436 years providing an estimated need for endodontic therapy risk of 0.15% per year. The estimated 35-year cumulative survival was 97.36%. The majority of endodontic treatments (67%, 52/76) occurred in the first 5 years. The estimated cumulative survival of anterior complete coverage, posterior complete coverage, posterior partial inlay, and posterior partial onlay restorations was 98.89% (n=1476, 10 endodontic treatments), 96.38% (n=2119, 50 endodontic treatments), 96.78% (n=553, 11 endodontic treatments), and 98.53% (n=363, 5 endodontic treatments), respectively. Statistically significant differences occurred between anterior complete coverage, posterior complete coverage, and posterior partial coverage inlay restorations, with a higher incidence in posterior complete coverage and posterior partial inlay restorations (P<.05). First molars had the highest rate of endodontic therapy after restoration in both arches. Age and restoration thickness were significant factors, recording statistically higher number of endodontic treatments in participants >52 years and restorations with all surfaces ≥1 mm (P<.05). Other clinical variables, dental arch and sex of the participants, were not significantly related to endodontic treatments (P>.05). Conclusions The clinical performance of 4511 units over 30 years in service was excellent, with the estimated cumulative survival of 97.36%. Posterior complete coverage and posterior partial inlay restorations had a significantly higher need for endodontic therapy than anterior complete coverage restorations. Their overall clinical performance relative to endodontic treatment was excellent with a cumulative survival of 96.38% and 96.78% over 30 years. There was no difference in the endodontic treatment rate between posterior complete and partial coverage restorations. Thickness of the restoration affected the endodontic treatment rate, with ≥1 mm resulting in higher incidence. The age of the participants influenced the endodontic treatment rate, with higher incidence in the >52-year age group. Other confounding clinical variables did not have a significant effect on the endodontic treatment rate.",

Sustainable development is a global priority and requires a systemic, integrative approach from all sectors of society. The oral healthcare sector is responsible for substantial greenhouse emissions throughout its value chain, including raw material extraction, industrial production, supply distribution, clinical practice, and management of waste. Of all dental specialties, prosthodontics has been one of the main generators of carbon emissions by fabricating a single product such as dentures or crowns in multiple steps. Dental prosthetic procedures involve chemicals and materials such as polymers, ceramics, metals, gypsum, and wax, which are often used in large quantities and for a single use. Thus, environmental risks and socioeconomic burdens can result from residuals and improper disposal, as well as waste and the embedded costs of unused materials retained by manufacturers, retail suppliers, dental laboratories, and dental clinics. To mitigate the environmental impact generated by conventional prosthodontics, we urge awareness and the adoption of sustainable good practices in the daily routine of dental clinics and laboratories. Capacity building and investment in a circular economy and digital technology can reduce the carbon footprint of prosthetic dentistry and improve the quality of life for present and future generations.",

Methodology Seven electronic databases were searched for randomized clinical trials in patients who received LA (population) and either received a Phentolamine injection (intervention) after LA compared to placebo or sham (control) to cause a return of normal sensation (outcome). Risk of bias assessment was performed using Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool 2.0. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated as the event (time to return to the normal sensation) was a time-dependent event, as well as the weighted mean difference (WMD), was computed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Results Ten studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. After pooling the results quantitatively, the value of the HR in the tongue was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.41–0.75, P<.001); in lower lip, the value was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.38–0.83, P = .004) and for upper lip, the value was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31–0.80, P = .004). The WMD for the time to return for normal sensation was -47.71 min for the tongue (95% CI: -73.63 to -21.80 min, P<.001), -73.29 min for lower lip (95% CI: -88.41 to -58.16 min, P<.001) and -86.86 min for upper lip (95% CI: -101.16 to -72.57 min, P<.001). There is a high certainty of evidence that patients who have been administered local anesthesia may achieve faster recovery of normal sensation in tongue, and moderate certainty of evidence for return of normal sensation in lower lip and upper lip, if Phentolamine was administered after the local anesthesia. The adverse effects were reported in a few studies and were minor, not necessitating any medical intervention. Conclusions Phentolamine might be a useful adjunct in patients who desire an earlier return of normal sensation and function after local anesthesia. Future research should be directed to study the cost-effectiveness or dental patient-reported outcomes of Phentolamine after local anesthetic injections.","Local anesthesia, Phentolamine, Lidocaine, Dental anesthesia, Pain"

The authors described the occurrence of amalgam and nonamalgam restorations in the United States in primary and permanent teeth across age groups and according to sociodemographic characteristics. Methods The authors used clinical examination data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015-2018 for participants 2 years and older (n = 17,040). The authors estimated the prevalence and mean number of amalgam and nonamalgam restorations in primary and permanent teeth according to age groups (2-5 years, 6-11 years, 12-15 years, 16-19 years, 20-39 years, 40-59 years, 60-79 years, and ≥ 80 years), race and ethnicity, federal poverty guideline, education, and pregnancy status. Results The prevalence of amalgam restorations ranged from 4% through 69%. Overall, amalgam restorations were more prevalent in children and adolescents from racial and ethnic minority groups and families at lower poverty levels and with lower education. The mean number of teeth with nonamalgam restorations was higher than those with amalgam restorations in primary teeth of children aged 6 through 11 years, permanent teeth of those 12 through 15 years and 20 through 39 years, and women aged 20 through 49 years, regardless of pregnancy status. The mean number of amalgam restorations was higher than that for nonamalgam restorations in older age groups. Conclusions Nonamalgam restorations were the most common in the primary teeth of children older than 5 years and in the permanent teeth of adults younger than 40 years. Amalgam restorations were more common in older adults. Amalgam and nonamalgam restorations were equally common in children younger than 5 years. Practical Implications The study findings suggest a shift from amalgam to alternative restorative materials in the United States.","Dental restorations, dental amalgam, composites"

Methods Light-activated, lower surface polymerisation kinetics versus sample depth (1–4 mm) of 4 formulations were quantified using ATR-FTIR. Water sorption and solubility (at 1 week) were assessed following ISO/4049. PLS release (over 1 month) and biaxial flexural strength (over 6 months) of fully-cured, water-immersed, 1 mm thick discs were determined. Surface mineral precipitation, following immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF), was assessed by SEM. Z250 was used as a conventional composite comparator. Results With 40s light exposure, increasing depth (from 1 to 4 mm) led to enhanced delay before polymerisation (from 3 to 17s) and decreased final conversion (72-66%) irrespective of PLS and MCP level. Increasing PLS and MCP raised solubility (4–13 μg/mm3). Water sorption (between 32 and 55 μg/mm3) and final PLS release (8–13% of disc content) were raised primarily by increasing PLS. Higher PLS also reduced strength. Strength reached minimum values (69–94 MPa) at 3 months. Surface mineral deposition was enhanced by increased MCP. For Z250, polymerisation delays (3-6s) and final conversions (55-54%) at 1-4 mm depth, solubility (0 μg/mm3), water sorption (16 μg/mm3) and strength (180 MPa) were all significantly different. Conclusion Delay time increased whilst final conversion decreased with thicker samples. Higher PLS enhances its percentage release, but lower level is required to keep water sorption, solubility and mechanical properties within ISO 4049 recommendations. Doubling MCP raises solubility and enhances minerals reprecipitation with minimal mechanical property compromise.","Dental composite, Polymerisation, Strength, Water sorption, Polylysine, Monocalcium phosphate"

Methods Numbers of amalgam and composite posterior restorations from 2017 through 2019 were calculated using retrospective dental claims analysis of privately insured patients. Kruskal-Wallis and multilevel, multivariable negative binomial regression models were used to test for differences in rates of amalgam and composite restoration placement by age group, sex, urban or rural area, and percentage race and ethnicity area distribution. Statistical significance was set at 0.05, with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery rate. Results The rate of amalgam restorations declined over time from a mean of 6.29 per 100 patients in 2017 to 4.78 per 100 patients in 2019, whereas the composite restoration rate increased from 27.6 per 100 patients in 2017 to 28.8 per 100 in 2019. The mean number of amalgam restorations placed per person were lowest in females compared with males, in urban areas compared with rural areas, and in areas with more than 75% non-Hispanic White residents. Conclusions Amalgam restoration placements in privately insured people in the United States declined from 2017 through 2019. Amalgam restoration placements may be unevenly distributed by location. Practical Implications Achieving further declines of dental amalgam use may require changes to insurance coverage, incentives, and provider training as well as augmented disease prevention and health promotion efforts. These efforts should focus particularly on groups with high caries risk or higher rates of amalgam placement.","Dental amalgam, dental restoration, health equity"

Methods Patients who underwent root canal retreatment at a university dental clinic were contacted for clinical and radiographic follow-up. The retreatment outcomes in these cases were based on clinical signs, symptoms, and radiographic criteria. Inter- and intraexaminer concordances were calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient. The retreatment outcome was dichotomized into success or failure according to strict and loose criteria. The radiographic success criteria consisted of complete resolution or absence of a periapical lesion (strict criteria) or a reduction in the size of an existing periapical lesion at recall (loose criteria). χ2 tests were used to evaluate possible variables associated with retreatment outcomes (age, sex, tooth type, location, contact points, periapical status, quality of previous and final root canal filling, previous and final restoration, number of visits, and complications). Results Overall, 129 teeth (113 patients) were included in the final evaluation. The success rate was 80.6% under strict criteria and 93% under loose criteria. Molars, teeth with an initially higher periapical index score, and teeth with >5 mm periapical radiolucency had a lower success rate according to the strict criteria model (P < .05). When the loose success criteria were used, teeth with larger (>5 mm) periapical lesions and those that had been perforated during retreatment showed a lower success rate (P < .05). Conclusions The present study demonstrated that nonsurgical root canal retreatment is a highly successful procedure after an observation period of 2–3 years.

It is an adjunct tool for diagnosing pathologies in the oral cavity that overcomes some limitations of current methodologies, including direct clinical examination, 2D radiographs, and cone beam computerized tomography. Increasing demand for soft tissue imaging has led to continuous improvements on transducer miniaturization and spatial resolution. The aims of this study are (1) to create a comprehensive overview of the current literature of ultrasonic imaging relating to dentistry, and (2) to provide a view onto investigations with immediate, intermediate, and long-term impact in periodontology and implantology. Methods A rapid literature review was performed using two broad searches conducted in the PubMed database, yielding 576 and 757 citations, respectively. A rating was established within a citation software (EndNote) using a 5-star classification. The broad search with 757 citations allowed for high sensitivity whereas the subsequent rating added specificity. Results A critical review of the clinical applications of ultrasound in dentistry was provided with a focus on applications in periodontology and implantology. The role of ultrasound as a developing dental diagnostic tool was reviewed. Specific uses such as soft and hard tissue imaging, longitudinal monitoring, as well as anatomic and physiological evaluation were discussed. Conclusions Future efforts should be directed towards the transition of ultrasonography from a research tool to a clinical tool. Moreover, a dedicated effort is needed to introduce ultrasonic imaging to dental education and the dental community to ultimately improve the quality of patient care.","Dental, Diagnosis, Imaging, Implant, Periodontal, Ultrasound"

Corticosteroids are the primary therapeutic option for symptomatic OLP however treatment of lesions unresponsive to corticosteroids that tend to recur are becoming challenging for the clinicians. Currently photodynamic therapy (PDT) is being explored as a new curative option for reduction of pain and/or burning sensation associated with OLP lesions. Aims and objective The aim of this systematic review was to analyse studies from literature on the therapeutic effectiveness of PDT in management of symptomatic OLP unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy. Methods The electronic retrieval systems and databases PUBMED [MEDLINE], EMBASE, SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, and SCIENCE DIRECT were searched independently by two authors for relevant articles from January 2015 till July 2021. Primary studies focussed on the role of PDT in treatment of symptomatic OLP and published in English were included. Results Out of the 370 articles, only ten studies met the selection criteria. Included studies demonstrated PDT as an effective alternative modality to treat symptomatic OLP with no drop outs. In all studies, with PDT reduction in lesion size and VAS score was observed during each follow up sessions and after treatment (approx. 12 weeks) when compared to pre-treatment level (p < 0.001). Four studies noted PDT to be more effective than topical corticosteroids in reduction of signs and symptoms of OLP (p = 0.001). Conclusion In the future, long-term studies on larger population should be conducted to establish the clinical effectiveness in PDT in symptomatic OLP. Studies should take into consideration different sources of light and photosensitizers to determine the ideal parameters of PDT treatment for OLP. Wavelength is the most important factor in all types of photo therapies, so the most appropriate wavelength should be selected to obtain better outcome.","Corticosteroids, Oral lichen planus, Photodynamic therapy, Treatment"

Methods A total of 3682 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (January 2017 to March 2020) were included in this cross-sectional analysis. We utilized multivariable linear regression models to investigate the associations between the number of oral restorations and PbB levels or renal function. The mediating effect of PbB on renal function indicators was analyzed using the R mediation package. Results Based on the indicators of 3682 participants, we found that the elderly, females, and whites were fit with more oral restoration, which was accompanied by increased PbB levels and decreased renal function. Meanwhile, oral restoration count was positively associated with PbB level (β = 0.023, 95% CI: −0.020 to 0.027), renal function-related urine albumin creatinine ratio (β = 1.541, 95% CI: 0.615–2.468), serum uric acid level (β = 0.012, 95% CI: 0.007 to 0.017), and serum creatinine level, and negatively associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (β = −0.804, 95% CI: −0.880 to −0.728). Furthermore, the mediation effect test confirmed that PbB played a mediating role in the relationship between restoration count and serum uric acid or eGFR, with mediation effects accounting for 98.0% and 71.0%, respectively. Conclusions Oral restoration negatively affects renal function. Oral restoration-related PbB level is a potential mediating factor.","Oral restorations, Blood lead, Renal function, Nephrotoxicity"

Hg can be toxic to animal and human populations and exacerbate the degradation of neotropical freshwater ecosystems. We examined drivers of Hg accumulation in fish that inhabit oxbow lakes of Peru's Madre de Dios, a region with high biodiversity value and increasing human populations that depend on ASGM. We hypothesized that fish Hg levels would be driven by local ASGM activities, by environmental Hg exposure, by water quality, and by fish trophic level. We sampled fish in 20 oxbow lakes spanning protected areas and areas subject to ASGM during the dry season. Consistent with previous findings, Hg levels were positively associated with ASGM activities, and were higher in larger, carnivorous fish and where water had lower dissolved oxygen levels. In addition, we found a negative relationship between fish mercury levels associated with ASGM and the occurrence of the piscivorous giant otter. The link between fine-scale quantification of spatial ASGM activity and Hg accumulation, as indicated by the result that in the lotic environment, localized effects of gold mining activities are stronger drivers (77 % model support) of Hg accumulation than environmental exposure (23 %) constitutes a novel contribution to a growing body of literature on Hg contamination. Our findings provide additional evidence of high Hg exposure risks to neotropical human and top carnivore populations subject to the impacts of ASGM, which depend on freshwater ecosystems undergoing gradual degradation. The documented spatial variation in Hg accumulation and increased Hg levels in carnivorous fish should serve as a warning to human communities in Madre de Dios to avoid the proximity of high-intensity gold mining areas and minimize local carnivorous fish consumption.","Biomagnification, Methylmercury, Seasonality, Floodplains"

Methods Three-point bending tests were conducted to measure the viscoelastic parameters. These parameters are used to compute the residual stresses of the anterior crown after crystallization. In the next analysis, the cyclic loading on the anterior crown was calculated. Based on this combined stress state (residual stress and stress state due to external cyclic loading), the life cycle and fracture probability of the anterior crown was calculated using the CARES/Life software. Finally, fatigue experiments were carried out to compare and validate the results of the computations. Results Although a sound qualitative comparison of the lifetime of both materials can be done using this methodology, the calculated fracture probability of the anterior crown for both materials was very low in comparison with the fatigue test results using the fatigue parameters determined from the experiments. In order to achieve good correspondence with the experimental results, the SCG exponent n for both materials should be modified by a correlation factor of 0.38.

Purpose The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the current literature on the direct and indirect restoration of endodontically treated posterior teeth. Material and methods Databases MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE were screened. Risk of bias was assessed by using the ROB2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for prospective and retrospective clinical studies. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective studies comparing direct composite resin and indirect restorations on endodontically treated posterior teeth were included. Outcomes were tooth and restoration survival. A meta-analysis was conducted for tooth retention and restorative success. Results Twenty-two studies were included (2 RCTs, 3 prospective, and 17 retrospective). Over the short term (2.5 to 3 years), low-quality evidence suggested no difference in tooth survival. For the prospective and retrospective clinical trials, the overall risk of bias was serious to critical from the risk of confounding because of a difference in restorative indication: Direct restorations were fabricated when one marginal ridge remained or when tooth prognosis was unfavorable. For short-term restorative success, low-quality evidence suggested no difference between the direct and indirect restorations. Conclusions For the short term (2.5 to 3 years), low-quality evidence suggests no difference in tooth survival or restoration quality.

However, there is little evidence comparing its efficacy against the currently well-established technique of utilizing acellular scaffolds (ACs) with concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA) for treating knee chondral defects. Objectives To compare scaffold-implanted MSCs against ACs with cBMA for the repair of knee cartilage lesions. Data Sources Medline and Embase. Study Eligibility Criteria, Participants, and Interventions Inclusion: (1) Studies involving patients with high grade chondral lesions on the tibiofemoral or patellofemoral articular surfaces, (2) studies involving patients that received either scaffold-implanted MSCs or ACs for treatment, and (3) studies with postoperative patient follow-up of at least 1 year. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods Single-arm meta-analysis of studies reporting patient-reported outcome measures, reoperation and incomplete filling rates was performed. Results Degree of postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee score improvement in patients receiving ACs augmented with cBMA was significantly higher compared to those receiving scaffold-implanted MSCs (P < .01). Additionally, patients receiving ACs with cBMA augmentation were at significantly lower risk of incomplete defect filling when compared to patients receiving either scaffold-implanted MSCs (P < .01), or patients receiving non-cBMA augmented ACs (P < .01). Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrates that cartilage repair with ACs with cBMA augmentation yields marginally better short-term outcomes when compared to scaffold-implanted MSCs. This suggests that even with the advent of MSCs increasing in availability as a treatment modality, ACs with cBMA augmentation remains as a competitive, cost-effective option for cartilage repair.","Cartilage repair, Meta-analysis, Mesenchymal stem cells, Orthopedic surgery"

Furthermore, the hydrophilicity of the materials increased after aging process. The cell proliferation/viability of human gingival fibroblasts was the highest in E before and after aging. Almost all cells survived for all groups based on a live/dead assay. Conclusions Leucite-reinforced glass–ceramic exhibit the highest color stability and biocompatibility after aging. The color stability and biocompatibility of CAD-CAM glass–ceramics depend on the aging process and material type. Clinical significance Various CAD-CAM glass–ceramics exhibit adequate color stability after UW aging. The leucite-reinforced glass–ceramics exhibit the highest color stability, cell proliferation, and viability after aging. The color stability, mechanical and surface properties, and biocompatibility of the glass–ceramics depend on the aging process and material type.","Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing glass–ceramic, Ultraviolet weathering aging, Color stability, Cell biocompatibility, Mechanical property, Surface property"

Methods The maxilla and mandible of a fully dentate cadaver were scanned by the ATOS industrial scanner to create a master model. Then, the specimens were scanned eight times by each intraoral scanner (IOS). In addition, 8 polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) impressions were made and digitized with a Medit T710 desktop scanner. Stone models were then poured and again scanned with the desktop scanner. All IOS, PVS, and stone models were compared to the master model to calculate the mean absolute surface deviation for mandibular teeth, maxillary teeth, and palate. Results For mandibular teeth, the PVS trueness was only significantly better than the Medit i700 (p < 0.001) and Primescan (p < 0.05). In maxillary teeth, the PVS trueness was significantly better than all IOSs (p < 0.05–0.001); the stone trueness was significantly better than Emerald S (p < 0.01), Medit i700 (p < 0.001) and Primescan (p < 0.01). In the palate, PVS and stone trueness were significantly lower than the iTero Element 5D (p < 0.01) and Trios 4 (p < p < 0.01). Stone trueness was significantly lower than the Medit i700 (p < 0.05). The precision in the palate was significantly lower for PVS and stone than for Emerald S (p < 0.01, p < 0.05), iTero Element 5D (p < 0.01, p < 0.01), Primescan (p < 0.001, p < 0.001), and Trios 4 (p < 0.001, p < 0.01). Significant differences in trueness between the IOSs were observed only in the mandibular teeth. The Medit i700 performed worse than Emerald S (p < 0.01) and iTero Element 5D (p < 0.01). For mandibular teeth, the Medit i700 was significantly more precise than Primescan (p < 0.01) and the Emerald S (p < 0.05). The Trios 4 was significantly less precise than Emerald S (p < 0.05). The precision of Medit i700 was significantly worse than iTero Element 5D (p < 0.01) for maxillary teeth, as well as the Primescan (p < 0.01) and Trios 4 (p < 0.05) for the palate. Conclusions In general, indirectly digitized models from PVS impressions had higher trueness than IOS for maxillary teeth; precision between the two methods was similar. IOS was more accurate for palatal tissues. The differences in trueness and precision for mandibular teeth between the various techniques were negligible. Clinical significance All investigated IOSs and indirect digitization could be used for complete arch scanning in mandibular and maxillary dentate arches. However, direct optical digitization is preferable for the palate due to the low accuracy of physical impression techniques for soft tissues.","Intraoral scanner, Trueness, Accuracy, Conventional impression, Cadaver"

However, these materials can shrink during polymerization, leading to microleakages that enable bacteria to erode tooth tissue and cause secondary caries. As a result, there is great clinical demand for the development of antibacterial resins. The principle of antibacterial resin includes contact killing and filler-release killing of bacteria. For contact killing, quaternary ammonium salts (QACs) and antibacterial peptides (AMPs) can be added. For filler-release killing, chlorhexidine (CHX) and nanoparticles are used. These antibacterial agents are effective against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and more. Among them, QACs has a lasting antibacterial effect, and silver nanoparticles even have a certain ability to kill viruses. Biocompatibility-wise, QACs, AMPs, and CHX have low cytotoxicity to cells when added into the resin. However, nanoparticles with smaller particle sizes have higher cytotoxicity. In terms of mechanical properties, QACs, AMPs, and CHX do not negatively affect the resin. However, the addition of magnesium oxide can have a negative impact. This paper reviews the types and antibacterial principles of commonly used antibacterial resins in recent years, evaluates their antibacterial effect, biological safety, and mechanical properties, and provides references for selecting clinical filling materials.","Antibacterial resin, Quaternary ammonium salt, Chlorhexidine, Nano fillers, Contact killing, Antibacterial peptides"

Data Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) investigating direct and indirect resin composite restorations in posterior permanent teeth were considered. Sources Several electronic databases were searched, with no language or date restrictions. The revised Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB-2) was used to analyze the studies; meta-analyses were run and the certainty of evidence was assessed by the GRADE tool. A subgroup meta-analysis was performed for resin composite restorations placed on posterior worn dentition. Study selection Twenty-three articles were included in qualitative synthesis, while 8 studies were used for meta-analyses. According to the RoB-2 tool, 5 studies were ranked as “low risk”, 7 had “some concerns”, while 11 papers were rated as “high risk” of bias. There were no statistically significant differences in short-term (p = 0.27; RR=1.54, 95% CI [0.72, 3.33]), medium-term (p = 0.27; RR=1.87, 95% CI [0.61, 5.72]) and long-term longevity (p = 0.86; RR=0.95, 95% CI [0.57, 1.59]). The choice of restorative technique had no influence on short-term survival of resin composite restorations placed on worn dentition (p = 0.13; RR=0.46, 95% CI [0.17, 1.25]). The certainty of evidence was rated as “very low”. Conclusions Direct and indirect resin composite restorations may show similar clinical longevity in posterior region, regardless of the observation period or substrate (wear-affected and non-affected dentition). The very low quality of evidence suggests that more long-term RCTs are needed to confirm our results.","Longevity, Composite restoration, Systematic review"

Methods Eighty human mandibular premolars were prepared and divided into 2 groups according to the localization of the perforation area, having a 1-mm diameter. The distance between the occlusal edge and the beginning of the perforation was measured under a stereomicroscope (actual working length) using 2 EALs (Propex II [Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland] and Dentaport ZX [J. Morita, Tokyo, Japan]) (electronic working length) and CBCT images (CBCT working length). The calculations were made by subtracting the actual working length from the electronic working length and the CBCT working length to determine the differences. Results In the apical third perforation group, there was a significant difference between Dentaport ZX and CBCT imaging. There was no significant difference between Dentaport ZX and Propex II and Propex II and CBCT measurements. In the middle third perforation group, Propex II was significantly more successful than CBCT imaging. In addition, there was no significance between the accuracy of Propex II in detecting the perforation area between the apical third perforation group and the middle third perforation group. CBCT imaging was more accurate in detecting the perforation area in the apical third perforation group than in the middle third perforation group. Conclusions In cases in which the root canal perforation was in the apical third of the root, both the EAL and CBCT imaging were successful in determining the perforation area, whereas the success rate of all devices used in this study decreased when the perforation area was in the middle third of the root.","Cone-beam computed tomography, electronic apex locator, perforation, root canal"

The aim of this research was to synthesize a novel low-shrinkage dental resin with antibacterial and self-healing properties. The low-shrinkage dental resin was obtained by incorporating a 20 wt% anti-shrinkage mixture of an expanding monomer 3,9-diethyl-3,9-dimethylol −1,5,7,11-tetraoxaspiro[5,5] undecane and an epoxy resin monomer diallyl bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (1:1, referred as “UE”) and different mass fractions of self-healing antibacterial microcapsules (0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10%) were incorporated into the matrix to prepare multifunctional dental resin. Polymerization shrinkage, mechanical properties, antibacterial activity, self-healing ability, and cytotoxicity of this dental resin were evaluated. The polymerization volumetric shrinkage of resin containing 20 wt% UE and 7.5 wt% microcapsules was reduced by 30.12% (4.13% ± 0.42%) compared with control. Furthermore, it exhibited high antibacterial activity and a good self-healing efficiency of 71% without adversely affecting the mechanical property and cell viability.

Materials and methods Fluorinated graphene (FG) with bright white color was prepared from fluorinated graphite (SIGMA Aldrich), using modified Hummer's method, to be added to conventional glass ionomer cements (GICs). In addition to a control group (group 1), experimentally modified GICs were prepared by adding FG to the conventional glass ionomer powder with three different weight ratios; (group 2, 1 wt %; group 3, 2.5 wt %; and group 4, 5 wt %) using mechanical blending method. Experimental groups of the specimens (n = 240) were divided, for each concentration (n = 120) half of the specimens were subjected to thermo-cycling. Hardness, compressive strength, and antibacterial activity of (FG/GICs) were measured with and without thermo-cycling. Compressive strength was measured by a universal testing machine, hardness was measured using a Vickers micro-hardness tester, and antibacterial effects against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans were tested by the pellicle sticking method. For statistical analysis, numerical data were explored for normality and variance homogeneity using Shapiro-Wilk and Leven's tests respectively. Results The prepared (FG/GICs) showed an increase in hardness in group 4 (p < 0.001). Groups 3 and 4 gave the highest compressive strength values with no significant difference between them (p < 0.001). Groups 2, 3, and 4 showed improved antibacterial activity with no statistical difference between them (p > 0.001). Results after thermo-cycling showed significantly decreased hardness, and compressive strength values (p < 0.001), however, the results of antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans showed no statistical difference after thermo-cycling (group 2, p = 0.05; group 3, p = 0.18; group 4, p = 0.26). The same results were observed for antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.92, p = 0.14, and p = 0.48 respectively). Conclusion FG can be considered a promising additive to GICs to promote its anti-cariogenic effects, however, these antibacterial effects are only useful in the short term, as aging adversely affected their mechanical properties. The 2.5 wt % FG/GICs is suggested to be the most encouraging, as after aging, it represented the highest compressive strength among all groups, while its hardness values were at least comparable to that of conventional glass ionomer. Clinical significance FG/GICs can be considered an anti-cariogenic restoration in temporary restorative interventions, as in certain cases in deciduous teeth where considerable esthetics may be required, especially those with difficult moisture control, where neither resin composite restorations nor amalgam restorations will be indicated. It can also be used for patients with high caries index or in atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) in low-income countries.",

The authors aimed to develop and test potential interventions targeting dentists’ behavior. Methods Problem-centered interviews were performed. Emerging themes were linked to the Behavior Change Wheel to develop potential interventions. The efficacy of 2 interventions was then tested in a postally delivered behavioral change simulation trial among German dentists (n = 1,472 per intervention). Dentists’ stated repair behavior regarding 2 case vignettes was assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using McNemar test, Fisher exact test, and a generalized estimating equation model (P < .05). Results Two interventions (guideline, treatment fee item) were developed on the basis of identified barriers. A total of 504 dentists participated in the trial (17.1% response rate). Both interventions significantly changed dentists’ behavior toward repairs of composite and amalgam restorations, respectively (guideline: difference [Δ] = +7.8% and Δ = +17.6%, treatment fee item: Δ = +6.4% and Δ = +31.5%; adjusted P < .001). Dentists were more likely to consider repairs if they already performed repairs frequently (odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.34) or sometimes (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.16), if they regarded repairs as highly successful (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.48), if their patients preferred repairs over total replacements (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.23), for partially defective composite restorations (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.39 to 1.53), and after receiving 1 of the 2 behavioral interventions (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.19).

Regarding the seven domains of the OHIP, the largest difference in OHIP-score was found in the domain of ‘Psychological Discomfort’. The mean overall OHIP-score was 1.8 at baseline and 1.3 at the 5-years recall. The mean OES score increased from 41.8 at baseline to 66.1 at the 5-years follow-up. Conclusions Tooth wear patients reported significant improvements in their OHRQoL and their perception of orofacial aesthetics after restorative treatment. This increase remained at least five years post-treatment. Clinical Significance The clinical impact of restorative treatment for tooth wear patients is considerable. This paper emphasizes the need to include a discussion of the patient related outcome measures when planning care.","Oral health related quality of life, Aesthetics, Perception, Tooth wear, Restorative treatment, OHIP, OES"

Despite developments in composite resins such as nanotechnology and bulk-filling techniques, studies investigating the performance of composite resin restorations when used to support occlusal rests remain scarce. Purpose The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the performance of bulk-fill versus incremental (conventional) nanocomposite resin restorations when they are used to support RPD rests under functional loading. Material and methods Thirty-five caries-free intact maxillary molars of similar coronal size were collected and divided into 5 equal groups (n=7): Enamel (Control) group: rest seats prepared entirely in enamel; Class I Incremental group: Class I cavities restored with incrementally placed nanohybrid resin composite resin (Tetric N-Ceram); Class II Incremental group: Mesio-occlusal (MO) Class II cavities restored with Tetric N-Ceram; Class I Bulk-fill group: Class I cavities restored with high-viscosity bulk-fill hybrid resin composite (Tetric N-Ceram Bulk-Fill); and Class II Bulk-fill group: MO Class II cavities restored with Tetric N-Ceram Bulk-Fill. Occlusal rest seats were prepared mesially in all groups, and clasp assemblies were fabricated and cast in cobalt chromium alloy. Specimens with their clasp assemblies were subjected to thermomechanical cycling using a mechanical cycling machine (250000 masticatory cycles) and 5000 thermal cycles (5 °C to 50 °C). Surface roughness (Ra) was measured with a contact profilometer before and after cycling. Fracture analysis was done using stereomicroscopy, and margin analysis was done with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) before and after cycling. Statistical analysis of Ra was conducted using ANOVA followed by the Scheffé test for between-group comparison and paired t test for within-group comparison. The Fisher exact probability test was used for fracture analysis. The Mann–Whitney test was used for between-group comparison and Wilcoxon signed rank test for within-group comparison for the SEM images (α=.05). Results Mean Ra increased significantly after cycling in all groups. Significant differences in Ra were found between enamel and all 4 resin groups (P<.001), with no significant differences between incremental and bulk-fill resin groups for both Class I and II specimens (P>.05). No significant differences were found between the 2 resin groups with regard to fracture and margin analysis (P>.05). Conclusions The surface roughness of enamel was significantly lower than that of both incremental and bulk-fill nanocomposite resins before and after functional loading. Incremental and bulk-fill nanocomposite resins showed comparable performance in terms of surface roughness, fracture behavior, and marginal adaptation.",

Methods Methacrylamide-based QAC (Quaternary Ammonium Compound) monomers, 1-(11-Methacryla-midoundecyl)pyridine-1-ium bromide (MAUPB) and 1-(12-Methacryl-amidododecyl)pyridine-1-ium bromide (MADPB), and their methacrylate-derivatives, N-(1-Methacryloylundecanyl)pyridinium bromide (MUPB) and N-(1-Methacryloyldodecanyl)pyridinium bromide (MDPB), were synthesized and characterized. The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations were determined against S.mutans and E.faecalis. Cytotoxicity of unpolymerized monomers were evaluated using L-929 and MDPC-23. Each monomer was incorporated into experimental resins (BisGMA/TEGDMA/CQ/EDMAB or BisGMA/HEMA/CQ/EDMAB) at 10wt%. FTIR Spectra were collected for degree of conversion (DC%) measurement. Bacterial attachment on resin disks were determined by fluorescent microscope. Mechanical properties of experimental resins were evaluated by flexural strength & modulus and shear bond strength testing. Results The antibacterial activity of MDPB≥MUPB>MADPB>MAUPB. The TC50 of MAUPB> MADPB>MUPB >MDPB. Incorporation of MAUPB in BisGMA/TEGDMA-based resin, had no significant effect on DC%, while significantly increase DC% in BisGMA/HEMA-based Resin. MUPB and MAUPB containing resins showed less viable bacterial attachment than pure resins. After 3-month storage, resins containing MAUPB illustrated higher flexural strength than their corresponding resins containing MUPB. BisGMA/HEMA-based resin containing MAUPB illustrated significantly higher resin-dentin shear bond strength than that of MUPB and pure resin. Conclusions Methacrylamide monomer containing QAC, MAUPB, possessed antibacterial properties and superior physical and mechanical properties when incorporated in resin adhesives as compared to their corresponding methacrylate monomer, MUPB. Clinical significance Methacrylamide-based QAC monomers are potentially used to formulate antibacterial hydrolytic resistant resin adhesives and enhance resin-dentin bond strength.","Quaternary ammonium compound, Dental bonding, Degree of conversion, Flexural strength, Cytotoxicity, Dentin"

Methods Dental composites were prepared with varying amounts of polishing and incubated in a CDC bioreactor with an approximate shear of 0.4 Pa. S. mutans biofilms developed in the bioreactors fed sucrose or glucose and at 10-h or 40-h HRT for one week. Biofilms were characterized by confocal laser microscopy (CLM). Composite surface roughness was characterized by optical profilometry, and pre- and post-incubation composite surface fine structure and elemental composition were determined using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Results Polishing had a significant impact on surface roughness, varying by a factor of 15 between the polished samples and the unpolished control. S. mutans biofilms grew statistically significantly thicker on the unpolished composites. Biofilm thickness was greater at shorter 10-h HRT compared to 40-h HRT. In most cases, biofilm thickness was not statistically significantly greater in sucrose-fed bioreactors than in glucose-fed bioreactors. SEM-EDS analysis did not identify any significant change in elemental composition after aging. Conclusions Accurate characterization of oral cavity biofilms must consider shear forces and the use of techniques that minimize alteration of the biofilm structure. Under shear, surface smoothness is the most important factor determining S. mutans biofilm thickness followed by HRT, while sucrose presence did not result in significantly greater biofilm thickness. Clinical Significance The obvious patterns of S. mutans growth along sub-micron scale grooving created by the polishing process suggested that initial biofilm attachment occurred in the shear-protected grooves. These results suggest that fine polishing may help prevent the initial formation of S. mutans biofilms compared to unpolished/coarse polished composites.","Dental composite, Surface roughness, Streptococcus mutans, Biofilm, Sucrose, Glucose"

However, its use is declining, mainly driven by its poor aesthetics and by the development of tooth-coloured adhesive materials. Furthermore, the Minamata Convention agreed on a phase-down on the use of dental amalgam. This concise review is based on a FDI Policy Statement which provides guidance on the selection of direct restorative materials as alternatives to amalgam. The Policy Statement was informed by current literature, identified mainly from PubMed and the internet. Ultimately, dental, oral, and patient factors should be considered when choosing the best material for each individual case. Dental factors include the dentition, tooth type, and cavity class and extension; oral aspects comprise caries risk profiles and related risk factors; and patient-related aspects include systemic risks/medical conditions such as allergies towards certain materials as well as compliance. Special protective measures (eg, a no-touch technique, blue light protection) are required when handling resin-based materials, and copious water spray is recommended when adjusting or removing restorative materials. Cost and reimbursement policies may need to be considered when amalgam alternatives are used, and the material recommendation requires the informed consent of the patient. There is no single material which can replace amalgam in all applications; different materials are needed for different situations. The policy statement recommends using a patient-centred rather than purely a material-centred approach. Further research is needed to improve overall material properties, the clinical performance, the impact on the environment, and cost-effectiveness of all alternative materials.","Minimal intervention, Resin-based composite, Glass ionomer cement, Dental amalgam"

First of all, a transmission geometry consisting of 241Am (100 mCi) radioactive source and Ultra Ge detector was established to experimentally obtain the mass attenuation coefficients (μρ, cm2/g) of Beta Titanium (BT), Copper NiTi, NiTi (Nitinol) and stainless steel (SS) alloys, which are frequently used as orthodontic wires. The experimental μρ values in the energy range of 13.9–59.54 keV with the data obtained from the spectra were compared with the theoretical results generated with the EpiXS program. The μρ values at 59.54 keV were 0.760, 0.933, 0.924 and 1.315 cm2/g for BT, NiTi, Copper NiTi and SS, respectively. Based on μρ values, HVL and Zeff values were also obtained. The HVL values for BT, NiTi, Copper NiTi and SS at 59.54 keV were calculated as 0.203, 0.135, 0.138, 0.066 cm, respectively. Then, the buildup factor values of the alloys in the energy range of 0.015–15 MeV were calculated at penetration depths of 1–15 mfp. When all the results are evaluated together, SS is more effective in absorbing photons, while BT is the alloy with the highest photon buildup among the alloys studied. Besides, it is noteworthy that the alloys cause secondary scatterings. The data obtained from this study will provide information about the photon interaction parameters of orthodontic wires in dental and medical radiology applications.","Dental, Orthodontic wires, Photon interaction, Transmission"

Methods A retrospective chart review identified 2177 cases of large restorations placed on vital teeth. Based on the restoration type, patients were stratified into various groups for statistical analysis. After restoration placement, those who required endodontic intervention or extraction were classified as having pulpal disease. Results Over the course of the study, 8.77% (n = 191) of patients developed pulpal disease. Pulpal disease was slightly more common in the large noncrown group than the full-coverage group (9.05% vs 7.54%, respectively). For patients who received large fillings, there was not a statistically significant difference based on operative material (amalgam vs composite: odds ratio = 1.32 [95% confidence interval, 0.94–1.85], P > .05) or the number of surfaces involved (3 vs 4: odds ratio = 0.78 [95% confidence interval, 0.54–1.12], P > .05). The association between the restoration type and the pulpal disease treatment performed was statistically significant (P < .001). The full-coverage group more frequently underwent endodontic treatment than extraction (5.78% vs 3.37%, respectively). Only 1.76% (n = 7) of teeth in the full-coverage group were extracted compared with 5.68% (n = 101) in the large noncrown group. Conclusions It appears that ∼9% of patients who receive large restorations will go on to develop pulpal disease. The risk of pulpal disease tended to be highest in older patients who receive large (4 surface) amalgam restorations. However, teeth with full-coverage restorations were less likely to be extracted.","Chart review, crown, endodontic outcomes, pulpal response"

Although C-factor has been widely researched, its correlation with stress analysis in dental restorations remains controversial. This review aims to discuss the application and limitations of C-factor and define the restricted conditions under which the C-factor “rule of thumb” is applicable. Methods A thorough literature review was conducted on the application and limitations of C-factor in stress analysis of dental restorations. This was principally based on MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases and a review of the relevant studies and publications in scientific papers in international peer-reviewed journals for the specific topic of C-factor and polymerization shrinkage. Results The C-factor alone cannot provide an accurate prediction of the shrinkage stress of restorations and the mechanical behavior of material-tooth interfaces. C-factor is only applicable under one condition not typically seen in clinical practice: low, near-rigid compliance.

The aim of this study was to investigate the fracture resistance and fracture modes of mesio-occlusodistal (MOD) amalgam molar restorations with extensive cuspal fracture repaired or replaced using a bulk-fill resin-based composite material. Methods Amalgam restorations were placed in 84 permanent extracted molars and randomly assigned (n = 14) to groups: (1) MOD amalgam, (2) composite repair of 1-cusp fracture and adjacent proximal box, (3) composite repair of 1-cusp fracture, (4) composite repair of 2-cusp fracture, (5) replacement of 1-cusp defect and existing MOD amalgam, (6) replacement of 2-cusp defect and MOD amalgam. Each molar was prepared to simulate the assigned fracture and either repaired or replaced. Specimens were aged and then loaded to fracture. Fracture resistance and fracture modes were recorded. Results The authors found significant differences (P < .001) between group 4 (1,652.3 N) and groups 5 (3,095.0 N), 1 (2,669.8 N), 6 (2,658.6 N), and 2 (2,442.9 N) as well as between group 3 (2,133.5 N) and group 5 (3,095.0 N).

Therefore, the present study aimed to compare the surface microhardness of 3 bulk-fill resin composites handled with latex and nitrile gloves prior to light curing. Methods This in vitro experimental study consisted of 90 resin composite specimens with a 6-mm diameter and a 4-mm height divided equally and randomly into 9 groups. Prior to light curing, the resin composites were handled with latex gloves, nitrile gloves, or only a spatula (control).

The number of cusps involved had a statistically significant influence on the longevity of the restorations in premolars. Clinical Significance With good survival and low annual failure rates, direct resin composite restorations are a suitable treatment for repairing extensive defects in posterior teeth involving multiple cusps and surfaces, provided that they are placed by a dentist who has long experience and is skilled in the placement of direct composite materials.","Adhesion, Clinical trial, Cusp replacement, Dental materials, Restorative dentistry, Survival"

Methods Data on Class II restorations placed by one dentist between 1990 and 2016 were collected from patient files, including caries risk, tooth related variables, applied materials and dates of last check-up visit and restoration placement. Open sandwich restorations were placed before 2001, while after 2001, a total-etch technique using etch-and-rinse 3-step adhesive was used when placing a Class II composite restoration. For statistical analysis, Kaplan-Meier statistics and a multilevel Cox-Regression was conducted (p < 0.05). Annual Failures Rates (AFR) were calculated. Results 675 Class II restorations were placed in 91 patients, 491 total-etch restorations (observation time 2–18 y), and 184 open sandwich restorations (observation time 19–29 y) showing AFRs at 15 years as 2.9 % for total-etch and 9.7 % for open sandwich restorations. Secondary caries as failure was equally distributed among the 2 groups and 27 % of the failures in the open sandwich group were due to proximal deterioration of glass-ionomer cement. The Cox-regression showed a significant higher risk for failure for the open sandwich technique compared to total-etch class-II composite restorations (HR = 2.9; p < 0.001). Significance Application of glass-ionomer cement using the open sandwich technique cannot be recommended for class-II restorations as being more complex and showing poorer clinical performance.","Composite, Class II, Restoration, Glass-ionomer cement, Sandwich, Adhesive, Longevity, Survival, Clinical, Caries"

Sustaining oral health requires high-end dental materials with a plethora of attributes such as durability, non-toxicity and ease of application. The combination of different requirements leads to increasing miniaturization and complexity of the material components such as the composite and adhesives, which makes the precise characterization of the material blend challenging. Here, we demonstrate how modern IR spectroscopy and imaging from the micro- to the nanoscale can provide insights on the chemical composition of the different material sections of a dental filling. We show how the recorded IR-images can be used for a fast and non-destructive porosity determination of the studied adhesive. Furthermore, the nanoscale study allows precise assessment of glass cluster structures and distribution within their characteristic organically modified ceramic (ORMOCER) matrix and an assessment of the interface between the composite and adhesive material. For the study we used a Fourier-Transform-IR (FTIR) microscope and a quantum cascade laser-based IR-microscope (QCL-IR) for the microscale analysis and a scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) for the nanoscale analysis. The paper ends with an in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the different imaging methods to give the reader a clear picture for which scientific question the microscopes are best suited for. Statement of significance Modern resin-based composites for dental restoration are complex multi-compound materials. In order to improve these high-end materials, it is important to investigate the molecular composition and morphology of the different parts. An emergent method to characterize these materials is infrared spectroscopic imaging, which combines the strength of infrared spectroscopy and an imaging approach known from optical microscopy. In this work, three state of the art methods are compared for investigating a dental filling including FTIR- and quantum cascade laser IR-imaging microscopy for the microscale and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy for the nanoscale.","Dental resin composites, Adhesives, Infrared spectroscopy, Near-field microscopy, QCL-IR, FTIR"

Methods Posterior resin composite restorations (n = 228) at least 3 mm deep were inserted in 57 subjects using a split-mouth design. The adhesive was applied with/without prior application of a GL. A resin composite was used for all restorations. Spontaneous POS (risk and intensity), as well as POS caused by stimulation with an air blast and assess the response to horizontal and vertical percussion was assessed using two scales in the baseline and after 7, 14, and 30 days. In addition, some parameters were evaluated using FDI criteria up to 24 months of clinical service. Results No significant POS was observed (p > 0.05). A higher absolute risk and intensity of spontaneous POS was observed within 7 days (35.1%), without statistically significant differences among groups. At 24 months 5 restorations were considered clinically unsatisfactory, and 73 restorations showed minor discrepancies in adaptation, with no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05). Significance A GL agent does not influence POS in posterior restorations with bulk-fill resin composite. It may be considered a dispensable clinical step in the restorative protocol.","Clinical trial, Dental restoration, Permanent, Dentin sensitivity, Composite resin"

This study aimed to review existing literature on the relationship between small-scale mining (SSM) activities, with a focus on identifying key policy gaps and potential solutions to mitigate the negative impacts of these activities on water resources. The study further compares mining regulations of some key gold mining countries including South Africa, China, Nigeria, and Indonesia. A total of 128 published papers and reports were used in this study. The study found two major obstacles to ensuring safe and effective water use in Ghana's mining industry. The failure to implement previously existing restrictions, as well as a poor regulatory framework for the mining sector fails to adequately address the implications of mining activities on the environment and water resources. Furthermore, the mining industry's concentration on water use, particularly for small-scale miners, ignores the legacy impacts of such mines or the long-term effects of small-scale mining. Even for SSMs, it is suggested that there be an imposed aspect on the concurrent treatment and reusability of water with mining operations. By taking a distinct approach to the two primary types of mining activity, the issue of enforcement of current restrictions might be addressed. The SSMs' complex organization and less regulated nature necessitate a unique approach that takes advantage of the SSMs' de facto leaders in enforcing water use compliance. The authors propose that the recently established small-scale mining district centres be used as a conduit to employ these informal structures in enforcing compliance on water use in the SSMs and that as part of the mining district's broad technical assistance functions, the SSMs' leadership be trained on safe water use practices and simple water treatment and restoration techniques such as bioremediation and verification. This will ensure that this area of the mining industry is better controlled.","Water pollution, Policy and regulations, Ghana, Illegal small-scale mining"

Over the last decade, research on flexible electronics for monitoring and treatment of CVDs has attracted tremendous attention. In contrast to conventional medical instruments in hospitals that are usually bulky, hard to move, monofunctional, and time-consuming, flexible electronics are capable of continuous, noninvasive, real-time, and portable monitoring. Notable progress has been made in this emerging field, and thus a number of significant achievements and concomitant research prospects deserve attention for practical implementation. Here, we comprehensively review the latest progress of flexible electronics for CVDs, focusing on new functions provided by flexible electronics. First, the characteristics of CVDs and flexible electronics and the foundation of their combination are briefly reviewed. Then, four representative applications of flexible electronics for CVDs are elaborated: blood pressure (BP) monitoring, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, echocardiogram monitoring, and direct epicardium monitoring. Their operational principles, progress, merits and demerits, and future efforts are discussed. Finally, the remaining challenges and opportunities for flexible electronics for cardiovascular healthcare are outlined.",

Data The literature search was conducted based on the question: “Is the use of compomers as a dental filling material more successful in the restorative treatment of decayed primary teeth than other dental filling materials?” No language restriction was applied and systematic reviews published up to May 2023 were included. The ROBIS tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews. Data were extracted for narrative synthesis, considering the restoration failure/success outcomes. Search Online search was conducted in three databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane library). Study selection The electronic search yielded a total of 779 publications. Finally, 18 systematic reviews were included in this umbrella review. Four systematic reviews presented a low risk of bias, 11 presented an unclear risk of bias and three presented a high risk of bias. Most systematic reviews presenting low risk of bias reported no difference in the success rates of compomers compared to other dental filling materials used for restoration of decayed primary teeth. Studies that found a significant difference or that made clear recommendations towards the use of compomers were commonly rated with a high risk of bias. Conclusion Compomers are similar to other dental filling materials for the placement of direct restorations in primary teeth. Clinical significance The results of this umbrella review indicate a similar clinical performance of compomers compared to other materials containing a resin component for direct restoration in primary teeth. Therefore, the choice of restorative material will depend on multiple factors, such as clinician's skills/preferences, patients’ wishes, costs, and cavity type/location.","Compomer, Primary teeth, Overview, Systematic review, Umbrella review"

Materials and methods Patients treated in an orthodontic department (University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary) were included. Unerupted teeth on panoramic radiographs were analyzed for intracoronal radiolucent lesions. For each patient, the demographic data, jaw localization, number of unerupted teeth with pre-eruptive intracoronal resorption lesions, number of lesions per tooth, size and localization of pre-eruptive intracoronal resorption defects, affected tooth's surface, pulp involvement and ectopic position of the tooth with defects were recorded. Results In the 3,143 patients investigated, 55 teeth in 49 patients showed pre-eruptive intracoronal resorption lesions (subject incidence: 1.56%). The incidence on unerupted teeth was 0.25%. Pre-eruptive intracoronal resorption was significantly more common in mandibles (43 mandibular vs. 12 maxillary lesions) with an odds ratio of 12.84 (95% Confidence Interval: 5.19–31.74) and no gender differences were found (p = 0.746). The occurrence of pre-eruptive intracoronal resorption was highest in the youngest (7–10 years) mixed dentition status group (p < 0.001). Most of the lesions (44 of 55, or 80.0%) were localized in the dentin, occupying two-third or less of the dentin thickness. Only 12.73% (7/55) of the lesions were not localized on the occlusal surface. Of the lesions, 89.1% (49/55) showed no obvious size increase over an average follow-up of 36.4 ± 8.1 months. Conclusions Pre-eruptive intracoronal resorption may occur mainly in the mixed dentition stage in orthodontic patients. Careful and attentive radiographic evaluations may facilitate early detection and follow-up of the lesions’ possible dimensional changes, especially when resorption influences orthodontic extraction therapy.","Unerupted teeth, Pre-eruptive intracoronal resorption, PIR, PEIR, Radiolucent lesion"
