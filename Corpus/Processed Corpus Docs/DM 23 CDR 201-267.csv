Due to this, surface treatments have become an important part in the field of materials to attain certain desirable mechanical properties and surface properties. Surface of parts treated with laser surface remelting exhibits excellent surface and mechanical properties. It is a computer-based technique which provides the advantage of treating selective surfaces. Laser surface remelting tends to enhance corrosion resistance, microhardness, wear resistance, fatigue strength, and tensile strength of the materials. To achieve certain mechanical properties with laser surface remelting, an optimized set of laser processing parameters is essential. Laser surface remelting has become a compulsory treatment for parts manufactured by Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes as these processes provide poor surface, porosity, and hot cracking defects which ultimately affect the performance of parts.

While some are recycled, the majority of them are dumped in landfills. Iron and steel production leaves behind ferrous slag, which must be created organically, managed wisely and scientifically if the sector is to remain more sustainably maintained. Ferrous slag is the term for the solid waste that is produced when raw iron is smelted in ironworks and during the production of steel. Both its specific surface area and porosity are relatively high. Since these industrial waste materials are so easily accessible and offer such serious disposal challenges, the idea of their reuse in water and wastewater treatment systems is an appealing alternative. There are many components such as Fe, Na, Ca, Mg, and silicon found in ferrous slags, which make it an ideal substance for wastewater treatment. This research investigates the potential of ferrous slag as coagulants, filters, adsorbents, neutralizers/stabilizers, supplementary filler material in soil aquifers, and engineered wetland bed media to remove contaminants from water and wastewater. Ferrous slag may provide a substantial environmental risk before or after reuse, so leaching and eco-toxicological investigations are necessary. Some study revealed that the amount of heavy metal ions leached from ferrous slag conforms to industrial norms and is exceedingly safe, hence it may be employed as a new type of inexpensive material to remove contaminants from wastewater. The practical relevance and significance of these aspects are attempted to be analyzed, taking into account all recent advancements in the fields, in order to help in the development of informed decisions about future directions for research and development related to the utilization of ferrous slags for wastewater treatment.","Ferrous slag, Adsorbents, Coagulants, Wetland, Advanced chemical oxidation, Wastewater treatment"

G.","Uranium in natural waters and the environment: Distribution, speciation and impact",Applied Geochemistry,148,,105534,2023,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292722003389,"The concentrations of U in natural waters are usually low, being typically less than 4 μg/L in river water, around 3.3 μg/L in open seawater, and usually less than 5 μg/L in groundwater. Higher concentrations can occur in both surface water and groundwater and the range spans some six orders of magnitude, with extremes in the mg/L range. However, such extremes in surface water are rare and linked to localized mineralization or evaporation in alkaline lakes. High concentrations in groundwater, substantially above the WHO provisional guideline value for U in drinking water of 30 μg/L, are associated most strongly with (i) granitic and felsic volcanic aquifers, (ii) continental sandstone aquifers especially in alluvial plains and (iii) areas of U mineralization. High-U groundwater provinces are more common in arid and semi-arid terrains where evaporation is an additional factor involved in concentrating U and other solutes. Examples of granitic and felsic volcanic terrains with documented high U concentrations include several parts of peninsular India, eastern USA, Canada, South Korea, southern Finland, Norway, Switzerland and Burundi. Examples of continental sandstone aquifers include the alluvial plains of the Indo-Gangetic Basin of India and Pakistan, the Central Valley, High Plains, Carson Desert, Española Basin and Edwards-Trinity aquifers of the USA, Datong Basin, China, parts of Iraq and the loess of the Chaco-Pampean Plain, Argentina. Many of these plains host eroded deposits of granitic and felsic volcanic precursors which likely act as primary sources of U. Numerous examples exist of groundwater impacted by U mineralization, often accompanied by mining, including locations in USA, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Portugal, China, Egypt and Germany. These may host high to extreme concentrations of U but are typically of localized extent. The overarching mechanisms of U mobilization in water are now well-established and depend broadly on redox conditions, pH and solute chemistry, which are shaped by the geological conditions outlined above. Uranium is recognized to be mobile in its oxic, U(VI) state, at neutral to alkaline pH (7–9) and is aided by the formation of stable U–CO3(±Ca, Mg) complexes. In such oxic and alkaline conditions, U commonly covaries with other similarly controlled anions and oxyanions such as F, As, V and Mo. Uranium is also mobile at acidic pH (2–4), principally as the uranyl cation UO22+. Mobility in U mineralized areas may therefore occur in neutral to alkaline conditions or in conditions with acid drainage, depending on the local occurrence and capacity for pH buffering by carbonate minerals. In groundwater, mobilization has also been observed in mildly (Mn-) reducing conditions. Uranium is immobile in more strongly (Fe-, SO4-) reducing conditions as it is reduced to U(IV) and is either precipitated as a crystalline or ‘non-crystalline’ form of UO2 or is sorbed to mineral surfaces. A more detailed understanding of U chemistry in the natural environment is challenging because of the large number of complexes formed, the strong binding to oxides and humic substances and their interactions, including ternary oxide-humic-U interactions. Improved quantification of these interactions will require updating of the commonly-used speciation software and databases to include the most recent developments in surface complexation models. Also, given their important role in maintaining low U concentrations in many natural waters, the nature and solubility of the amorphous or non-crystalline forms of UO2 that result from microbial reduction of U(VI) need improved quantification. Even where high-U groundwater exists, percentage exceedances of the WHO guideline value are variable and often small. More rigorous testing programmes to establish usable sources are therefore warranted in such vulnerable aquifers. As drinking-water regulation for U is a relatively recent introduction in many countries (e.g. the European Union), testing is not yet routine or established and data are still relatively limited. Acquisition of more data will establish whether analogous aquifers elsewhere in the world have similar patterns of aqueous U distribution. In the high-U groundwater regions that have been recognized so far, the general absence of evidence for clinical health symptoms is a positive finding and tempers the scale of public health concern, though it also highlights a need for continued investigation.","Uranium, Uranyl, U isotopes, Drinking water, Redox, Mine water, NORM, Radionuclide"

Cytokines play crucial roles in the immune system reaction following tissue injury and/or body invasion by infectious or non-infectious bodies. They are classified as pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines depending on many factors such as structure and function. Some cytokines mediate inflammatory reactions and contribute to several diseases, such as Rheumatoid arthritis. Very few effective treatment strategies exist to tackle these inflammatory diseases and the available strategies for treatment are also associated with several severe side effects. Although we are in the scientific innovations and medical advancements era, natural compounds are still competing with modern artificial drugs and performing well to effectively treat many diseases without causing side effects. The main purpose of this review is to discuss the effect of some natural compounds on inflammatory cytokine production and elaborate their mode of action further based on already available and recently published literature. Methods We have reviewed a selected number of natural compounds (Echinacea, Curcumin, Genistein, Eugenol, 6-Gingerol, Thymoquinone, Allicin, Quercetin, Emodin and Parthenolide) that have shown pronounced effects on cytokine production and secretion in several physiological conditions. Findings and Conclusion Immune cells produce multiple pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that could be regulated accurately and effectively by using some natural compounds that can block the intracellular machinery and thus reduce cytokine production and secretion. This offers an intriguing background for grasping how these products conduct their activity at a cellular level and sheds light on other natural products to examine efficiency in the same aspect.","Cytokines, Inflammation, Natural compounds, Cytokine trafficking"

The study's scientific and practical significance lies in clarifying Jordan's nature and the growth, progress, and prosperity that this country is experiencing at all levels, despite the challenges it faced during the centennial; and in assisting researchers, scholars, politicians, and decision-makers in similar countries to Jordan in determining how to benefit from Jordan's experience as a role model. The study used historical, descriptive-analytical, systems analytical, and decision-making methodologies to answer the study's questions and examine its premise. It concluded that the ruling regime's religious, historical, and political legitimacy, as well as its relationship with the Hashemites, the nature of Jordanian society, as well as the rule of law and institutions, national unity, and the strong mutual relationship between the leadership and the people, all contributed to Jordan's century-long process of political stability and development.","Jordan, Stability, Sustainable, Regime, Legitimacy, National unity, Belonging and loyalty"

Such steady growth of PA imaging can mainly be attributed to its salient features, including being non-ionizing, cost-effective, easily deployable, and having sufficient axial, lateral, and temporal resolutions for resolving various tissue characteristics and assessing the therapeutic efficacy. In addition, PA imaging can easily be integrated with the ultrasound imaging systems, the combination of which confers the ability to co-register and cross-reference various features in the structural, functional, and molecular imaging regimes. PA imaging relies on either an endogenous source of contrast (e.g., hemoglobin) or those of an exogenous nature such as nano-sized tunable optical absorbers or dyes that may boost imaging contrast beyond that provided by the endogenous sources.

Bone cancer is mainly categorized into osteosarcoma (OS), chondrosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma. Of these, OS is the most intimidating cancer of the bone tissue, which is mostly found in the log bones in young children and older adults. Conspicuously, the current chemotherapy modalities used for the treatment of OS often fail mainly due to (i) the non-specific detrimental effects on normal healthy cells/tissues, (ii) the possible emergence of drug resistance mechanisms by cancer cells, and (iii) difficulty in the efficient delivery of anticancer drugs to the target cells. To impose the maximal therapeutic impacts on cancerous cells, it is of paramount necessity to specifically deliver chemotherapeutic agents to the tumor site and target the diseased cells using advanced nanoscale multifunctional drug delivery systems (DDSs) developed using organic and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs). In this review, we provide deep insights into the development of various DDSs applied in targeting and eradicating OS. We elaborate on different DDSs developed using biomaterials, including chitosan, collagen, poly(lactic acid), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), polycaprolactone, poly(ethylene glycol), polyvinyl alcohol, polyethyleneimine, quantum dots, polypeptide, lipid NPs, and exosomes.

Such policies have typically been implemented out of concern for the environment, but policy-makers often make poor assumptions about or ignore the associated perverse ecological and economic trade-offs that can threaten global action to conserve biodiversity and mitigate climate risk. The purpose of this paper is to inform and promote research on the application of the land sharing–sparing framework to better accommodate ecological and economic trade-offs in forest policy evaluation. The regional context is Queensland (QLD), Australia, where consideration is being given to policy changes that will substantially increase land sparing within the public and private native forest estate by contracting the area available for management under land sharing with selection timber harvesting. A modified conceptualisation of the land sharing–sparing framework is introduced, which explicitly accounts for the role that international trade can play in facilitating domestic land sparing policy. Critical reviews of literature concerning six important ecological and economic trade-offs that are associated with domestic forest policy are presented: (a) international biodiversity conservation; (b) climate risk mitigation; (c) securing domestic wood supply; (d) resourcing domestic forest management; (e) management of wildfire risk; and (f) domestic biodiversity conservation. Under existing policy settings, increased land sparing in QLD has a high risk of unintended negative outcomes, including for international biodiversity conservation and carbon emissions. While land sparing can benefit species that require long undisturbed forest habitat, conservation of most native flora and fauna in QLD is not substantially affected or is enhanced by selection harvesting practices permitted in the state. Decades of poor government resourcing of conservation estate management and timber plantation expansion suggests increased land sparing will have negligible benefits for domestic biodiversity conservation and wood supply in the absence of a considerable and permanent reallocation of scarce resources. In contrast, land sharing can provide greater long-term climate risk mitigation benefits, promote high biodiversity values through creation of heterogeneous landscape mosaics and leverage private sector resources for conservation activities. These complex ecological and economic trade-offs have been collated for the first time in an Australian context and justify further research to explore their quantification and accommodation within the land sharing–sparing framework to better inform forest policy-making.","Land sparing, Land sharing, Selection harvesting, Timber plantations, Threatened species, Ecological footprint, Life cycle analysis, Carbon sequestration"

Natural polymers have proved to be good excipients for incorporation in hybrid systems (nanocarriers dispersed in a semisolid base) for the management of skin affections. In addition to being biocompatible, biodegradable, economic, easily available and based on renewable resources, natural polymers also have intrinsic bioactive properties that greatly enhance their applicability in drug delivery systems.

The only way to reconcile geological facts is to suggest that the Verkhoyansk–Chukotka fold belt occupies most of the Laptev Sea shelf in the form of an orocline folded in two. The Verkhoyansk fold belt is composed mainly of deformed sediments accumulated during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic on the passive continental margin. The oroclinal structural model may be validated by tracing the edge of the continental shelf imprinted in Permian rocks, which are the only stratigraphic level available all over the sea periphery. This has been done for the southwestern, western, and eastern shores of the Laptev Sea. For the last locality, i.e., for the New Siberian Islands, the initiation and evolution of the late Paleozoic rifted continental margin facing the Laptev Sea was also outlined. Following the oroclinal model, the tectonic partitioning of Taimyr and Severnaya Zemlya is tentatively traced to the opposite side of the Laptev Sea. We assert that three Taimyr belts (South, Central, and North) are not separated by Paleozoic or Mesozoic sutures and are distinguishable by different composition and depositional settings of lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks formed on the marginal part of the Siberian continent. In particular, the North Taimyr belt is interpreted as a foreland basin developed during the collision of Siberia with Baltica in the late Ediacaran – Early Cambrian. Ordovician volcanic and plutonic belt in the eastern October Revolution Island we assume to be a riftogenic one, which is coeval with similar igneous occurrences of De Long Islands on the opposite side of the Laptev Sea. The Ordovician rifting could have initiated the opening of the Taimyr branch of the Ural Ocean, which, however, did not leave behind any material evidence. The most probable position of the suture is the Shokalsky Strait (separating Bolshevik and October Revolution Islands) and the shelf area along its strike. The collision of Siberia with the Kara block of Baltica occurred once again in the Late Paleozoic. Three fold belts largely shape the modern structure of the Laptev Sea region: the late Paleozoic North Taimyr belt, the Late Triassic South Taimyr one, and the Late Jurassic-Neocomian Verkhoyansk. All above orogenic belts were formed not at the boundaries of lithospheric plates but mainly at sites of extended and thinned lithosphere. These were the foreland basins of previous orogenies for the first two belts; and rifted passive continental margin for the last one. Revealed recent structure of the Laptev Sea region opens up the prospect of restoring pre-Cretaceous paleogeography when the relative position of continental blocks was quite different.","Arctic tectonics, Laptev Sea shelf, Verkhoyansk fold belt, Taimyr tectonic belts, New Siberian Islands, Orocline"

Furthermore, unlike other human tissues, dental enamel does not have a significant capacity for healing or self-repair and thus the longevity of natural teeth in the oral environment depends to a large degree on the fatigue and wear properties of enamel. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of our understanding of the fatigue and wear mechanisms of human enamel and how they relate to in vivo observations of tooth damage in the complex oral environment. A key finding of this review is that fatigue and wear processes are closely related. For example, the presence of abrasive wear particles significantly lowers the forces needed to initiate contact fatigue cracking while subsurface fatigue crack propagation drives key delamination wear mechanisms during attrition or attrition-corrosion of enamel. Furthermore, this review seeks to bring a materials science and mechanical engineering perspective to fatigue and wear phenomena. In this regard, we see developing a mechanistic description of fatigue and wear, and understanding the interconnectivity of the processes, as essential for successfully modelling enamel fatigue and wear damage and developing strategies and treatments to improve the longevity of our natural teeth. Furthermore, we anticipate that this review will stimulate ideas for extending the lifetime of the natural tooth structure and will help highlight where our understanding is too limited and where additional research into fatigue and wear of human tooth enamel is warranted.","Fatigue, Wear mechanisms, Human tooth enamel"

Although the eye is easily accessible to common drug formulations such as drops, its complex structure presents main obstacles to successfully deliver drugs. Low ocular bioavailability due to pre-corneal fluid and gravity drainage limits the efficacy of the products. Therefore, researchers have proposed various drug delivery systems synthesized by biomaterials, mostly polymers, which can deliver active ingredients to the ocular surface and remain for longer period. Such systems as electrospun fibrous structures resembling the extracellular matrix can embed various therapeutic molecules aiming to target eye diseases. The electrospun matrices, which can be used as inserts or implants, offer biocompatibility, biodegradability, and good mechanical properties.

Yet, how to precisely increase the spaces in which people experiencing marginalisation can address power asymmetries and strengthen their resilience, particularly from a methodological perspective, remains poorly understood. Here, we build on recent insights into political capabilities and their relevance for equitable resilience practice to assess the role research methods play in not only locating political capabilities but also enhancing them in the context of climate resilience. We present the findings from an in-depth analysis of 57 articles, out of a larger set of 200+ papers, that have employed co-learning/cooperative inquiries, participatory action research, participatory methods, workshops, and/or interviews combined with other approaches as most engaging and potentially empowering methods. Methodological insights through this analysis allow us to examine if and how resilience-in-the-making materialises across uneven power relations and often flawed decision-making processes. We show the pervasiveness of power differentials, even in research settings designed to be inclusive, and how disempowering processes in adaptation, mitigation, disaster management, and social transformation further marginalise already disadvantaged actors. At the same time, we illustrate the transformative role of alliances, resistance, shared learning, and sustaining inclusive approaches. Such nuanced insights into best processes as well as detrimental pitfalls are essential for development scholars and practitioners to help anchor deliberative resilience practice in the everyday lives of disadvantaged populations and foster political capabilities for more just climate action and policy.","Equitable resilience, Political capabilities, Inclusive decision making, Participation, Inequalities, Deliberation"

Based upon the analysis and synthesis of data, grain morphology and soil matrix structure are found to be the dominant factors on particle breakage. The breakage index may increase or decrease with respect to degree of saturation and the relative density depending upon the amount of confining pressure and mode of loading, respectively. It is also found that particle breakage is inversely proportional to the rate of loading. Moreover, the granular materials respond differently to the isotropic and deviatoric stress conditions, and accordingly the breakage indices may vary even for the same state of density. Further, the breakage indices determined by considering the shifting of gradation curve before and after crushing are found to be more accurate than the one determined by corresponding to an individual grain size. Some of the limitations in the literature includes non-inclusion of all the influencing parameter in the analysis by individual researches, insufficient studies on non-traditional granular material, and lack of large-scale model studies for proper inclusion of site-specific conditions etc. Since, the same generic rules cannot be applied to different types of granular media and one-to-one correlations may not be helpful, it is recommended to develop models and supplement the laboratory test results with numerical studies by simultaneously considering various influencing parameters. New guidelines relevant to the use of non-traditional granular materials should be formulated for various construction purposes in consideration of its crushing characteristics.","Particle breakage, Crushing, Soil parameters, Engineering properties, Breakage index, Industrial wastes"

The main component in 3D bioprinting, bioink, can be split into various categories depending on the criterion of categorization. Although the choice of bioink and bioprinting process will vary greatly depending on the application, general features such as material properties, biological interaction, gelation, and viscosity are always important to consider. The foundation of 3D bioprinting is the exact layer-by-layer implantation of biological elements, biochemicals, and living cells with the spatial control of the implantation of functional elements onto the biofabricated 3D structure. Three basic strategies underlie the 3D bioprinting process: autonomous self-assembly, micro tissue building blocks, and biomimicry or biomimetics. Tissue engineering can benefit from 3D bioprinting in many ways, but there are still numerous obstacles to overcome before functional tissues can be produced and used in clinical settings. A better comprehension of the physiological characteristics of bioink materials and a higher level of ability to reproduce the intricate biologically mimicked and physiologically relevant 3D structures would be a significant improvement for 3D bioprinting to overcome the limitations.",Bioink

Metallic orthopaedic materials have a shared application history with the aerospace industry, making them only partly efficient in the biomedical domain. However, suitability of metallic materials in bone tissue replacements and regenerative therapies remains unchallenged due to their superior mechanical properties, eventhough they are not perfectly biocompatible. Therefore, exploring ways to improve biocompatibility is the most critical step toward designing the next generation of metallic biomaterials. This review discusses methods of improving biocompatibility of metals used in biomedical devices using surface modification, bulk modification, and incorporation of biologics. Our investigation spans multiple length scales, from bulk metals to the effect of microporosities, surface nanoarchitecture, and biomolecules such as DNA incorporation for enhanced biological response in metallic materials. We examine recent technologies such as 3D printing in alloy design and storing surface charge on nanoarchitecture surfaces, metal-on-metal, and ceramic-on-metal coatings to present a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the subject.

Wide spectrums of contaminants pose numerous risks, necessitating their disposal and treatment. There is a need for further remediation methods since pollutant residues cannot be entirely eradicated by traditional treatment techniques. Bio-adsorbents are gaining popularity due to their eco-friendly approach, broad applicability, and improved functional and surface characteristics. Adsorbents that have been modified have improved qualities that aid in their adsorptive nature. Adsorption, ion exchange, chelation, surface precipitation, microbial uptake, physical entrapment, biodegradation, redox reactions, and electrostatic interactions are some of the processes that participate in the removal mechanism of biosorbents. These processes can vary depending on the particular biosorbent and the type of pollutants being targeted. The systematic review focuses on the many modification approaches used to remove environmental contaminants. Different modification or activation strategies can be used depending on the type of bio-adsorbent and pollutant to be remediated. Physical activation procedures such as ultrasonication and pyrolysis are more commonly used to modify bio-adsorbents. Ultrasonication process improves the adsorption efficiency by 15–25%. Acid and alkali modified procedures are the most effective chemical activation strategies for adsorbent modification for pollution removal. Chemical modification increases the removal to around 95–99%. The biological technique involving microbial culture is an emerging field that needs to be investigated further for pollutant removal. A short evaluation of modified adsorbents with multi-pollutant adsorption capability that have been better eliminated throughout the adsorption process has been provided.","Bio-adsorbents, Modification, Activation, Multi-pollutant, Wastewater, Pollution control"

Coal gasification slag is generated in the process of coal gasification owing to the existence of minerals in the coal, particularly the incomplete reaction of the organic carbon elements in the coal. This results in different contents of residual carbon in the coal gasification slag. The mixture of residual carbon and inorganic minerals (ash materials; a solid waste with a low resource utilization rate) restricts their utilization. The efficient separation of residual carbon and ash materials in coal gasification slag is essential for the resource utilization of coal gasification slag. The particle size of coal gasification fine slag (CGFS) is relatively fine, and the separation effect of the physical sorting method is low. In addition, flotation is still one of the most feasible means for the efficient separation of residual carbon and ash materials. Owing to the physical and chemical properties of CGFS, the large amount of reagents and low sorting effect severely restrict its industrial implementation. This review summarizes and analyzes the main reasons for the flotation process of coal gasification slag from three aspects (the flotation basis of minerals, difficult flotation, and difficulty of selection). The analysis is based on the development of an efficient collector for CGFS flotation, pretreatment of raw materials before flotation, addition of adjustment, and flotation optimization methods. Furthermore, it puts forward four directions for enhancing the flotation process of CGFS: the principle of the comprehensive analysis of the flotation separation of CGFS based on a variety of technologies, the selection and combination of high–efficiency collectors, precise adjustments based on the surface properties of CGFS, the design of synergistic regulation devices based on energy input and particles–bubbles action, and the comprehensive utilization of solid waste resources based on gravity separation–magnetic separation–flotation. The solutions for the above critical scientific and technical problems would provide technical and theoretical support for a feasible method to realize the resource, reduction, and high–value utilization of coal gasification slag all around the world.","Coal gasification fine slag, Flotation, Residual carbon, Separation, Ash materials"

A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase for English studies up to March 2023 according to the PRISMA guidelines. Only peer-reviewed controlled clinical trials (CCT) or randomized controlled trials (RCT) studies involving human subjects were included. The risk of bias of selected researches were evaluated by two independent authors using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. The literature search yielded 3491 articles, of which 42 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Most studies evaluated bacterial contamination in bio-aerosols, while the viral and fungal contamination was assessed in only three studies. Overall, various approaches have been applied in reducing aerosol contamination in clinical scenarios, including high-volume evacuators (HVE), mouse rinses and rubber dams, air cleaning systems, and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. The available evidence suggests that various aerosol mitigation strategies could be implemented to decrease the risk of cross-infection during clinical dental procedures in real-world environments. However, further clinical trials are necessary to establish statistical validity in measuring aerosol contamination and mitigation, as well as to evaluate the risk of infection transmission for viral and fungal contamination.","Aerosol contamination, Aerosol mitigation, Dental environments, Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus"
