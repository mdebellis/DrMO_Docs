The influence of interfacial reactive groups on shrinkage stress is explored. Methods Oligomers of varying lengths and with varying number of reactive groups along the length were synthesized by modifying commercial oligomers. Surface of silica fillers (OX50) was treated with methylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane and this was further reacted with the synthesized oligomers to obtain a series of polymer brushes on the surface. Fillers modified with ?-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane were used as a control. Filler surface treatment was confirmed using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Fillers were added at 30 wt % to a resin made of BisGMA/TEGDMA and polymerization kinetics, shrinkage stress, volumetric shrinkage, flexural strength and modulus, viscosity were measured. Results Composites with polymer brush functionalized fillers showed up to a 30 % reduction in shrinkage stress as compared to the control, with no reduction in flexural strength and modulus. Shrinkage stress reduced with increasing length of the polymer brush and increased with increase in number of reactive groups along the length of the polymer brush. Significance The interface between inorganic fillers and an organic polymer matrix has been utilized to reduce shrinkage stress in a composite with no compromise in mechanical properties. This study gives insights into the stress development mechanism at the interface.","Shrinkage stress, Shrinkage, Conversion, Photopolymerization, Filler, Surface modification, Polymer brush, Mechanical properties, Dental restorative, Silanes, Interface, Interphase",Composites with polymer brush functionalized fillers showed up to a 30 % reduction in shrinkage stress.

Methods Here, the refractive-index-matched monodisperse SiO2 were used as the supporting substrates to synthesize GO-cladded SiO2 spheres (xSiO2 @ yGO) through a mild electrostatic self-assembly process, where x and y represent the amount of SiO2 and GO in the reaction mixture, respectively. The morphology and the optical performance of the obtained xSiO2 @ yGO particles were modulated by varying the mass ratio of SiO2 and GO (5:1, 10:1, 50:1, and 100:1). All developed hybrid particles were silanized and formulated with dimethacrylate-based resins. These were tested for curing depth, polymerization conversion, mechanical performance, in vitro cell viability, and antibacterial activity. Results Of all xSiO2 @ yGO materials, increasing the mass ratio to 100:1 made the 100SiO2 @GO particles appear light brown and possess the lowest light absorbance from 300 to 800 nm. The results of CIEL*a*b* system showed that all these hybrid particles exhibited obvious discoloration compared with SiO2 and GO, where 100SiO2 @GO possessed the smallest color difference. Furthermore, following the results of curing depth, polymerization conversion, and mechanical performance of dental composites, the optimal filler composition was 100SiO2 @GO at 5 wt% filler loading. The resultant 100SiO2 @GO-filled composite produced the highest flexural strength (115 ± 12 MPa) and the lowest bacterial concentration (6.7 × 108 CFU/mL) than those of the resin matrix (78 ± 11 MPa; 9.2 × 108 CFU/mL) and 5 wt% SiO2-filled composite (106 ± 9 MPa; 9.1 × 108 CFU/mL), respectively, without affecting in vitro cell viability. Significance The facile and mild synthesis of xSiO2 @ yGO hybrid particles provided a convenient way to tune their optical property. The optimal 100SiO2 @GO particles could be considered as the promising antibacterial filler to be applied in dental care and therapy.","Refractive index-matched, Optical characteristic, Antibacterial property, Dental resin composite",Surveyed more article on Graphene oxide in dentistry….

Methods Patients who received at least one Class I or Class II direct composite restoration in a private office in 1986–1992 and had follow-up appointments were included. Failures and interventions over time were investigated using the dental records. A follow-up clinical recall was carried out in 2020. Two scenarios were considered: restorations that did not require any intervention (success) or restorations that were repaired and still functional (survival). Multivariate Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves were performed using success and survival rates (p < 0.05). Results One hundred patient records and 683 restorations were included. A total of 353 failures were reported (success rate= 48%). Main reasons for failure were fracture and secondary caries. Most interventions after failures were repairs. Replacements were registered in 183 cases (survival rate= 73%). Annual failure rates were below 2.5% (success) and 1.1% (survival). Larger restorations and maxillary molars had higher failure risks. No significant differences in success rates among different resin composites was observed. A typical observation in this sample of restorations was the presence of moderate to advanced signs of aging, including marginal and surface staining, wear, chipping, changes in anatomical shape and translucency. Clearly aged restorations were still clinically satisfactory. Significance: This long-term, practice-based study indicates that resin composites can be used to restore posterior teeth with a long-lasting durability.","Resin-based composites, Restorative dentistry, Longevity, Clinical study, Patient records, Survival analysis","Clinical study based drawbacks of long duration composite filling is fracture, secondary caries,marginal and surface staining, wear, chipping, changes in anatomical shape and translucency, Success rate : 48 %",

The understanding of the efficiency of the standard personal protective equipment (PPE) against inhalation of mercury vapor during these dental procedures is limited. This study aimed to simulate a clinical setting and quantify the absorbed mercury vapor by the operator according to different PPE protocols. Methods Surgical mask levels I, II, III, KN95 1870 AURA, 95PFE – Precision AIR™, and MSA Advantage 200-LS Respirator were tested for amalgam removal; surgical mask levels I and III for amalgam trituration and surgical mask level III for amalgam condensation. A control group was also performed without any PPE. All the PPE was tested in addition to the protective face shield, except the control group and mask level I. A portable multifunctional atomic absorption spectrometer RA-915M Mercury Analyzer (Lumex Instruments, St. Petersburg, Russia) was used to measure the mercury concentration that crosses the different PPE types. The background was measured before each analysis and subtracted from the result. Amalgam Permit Regular Set (Southern Dental Industries- SDI, Victoria, Australia) was used for all the experiments. 70 dental amalgams from seven experimental conditions (n=10) were prepared with dimensions of 2mm³ in a Cavity-type Class I; they were removed following the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology protocol. 10 SDI dental amalgams (n=5) for condensation were condensed in the same cavity shape and dimensions using conventional condensers for amalgam fillings. 15 capsules of SDI dental amalgam (n=5) were triturated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The results were tabled and submitted to nonparametric statistical analyses, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (? = 0.5). Results The results showed a significant difference in mercury vapor detected among the different kinds of PPE. Statistical tests pointed out that for the trituration and condensation steps, only masks level III plus Faceshield provided different results than the control group; for the amalgam removal experiment, only the 95PFE – Precision AIR™, and MSA Advantage 200-LS Respirator provided different results than the control group. Conclusion All the mercury vapor levels detected in this study were above the Reference Exposure Levels (REL) of the California Environmental Protection Agency (CA EPA, 2008) for intermittent 1-hour inhalation.",,,

Methods Patients (n = 91) receiving LidiSi (73.1%) and RBC (36.9%) inlays/onlays/overlays between 2007 and 2017 were selected. The restorations were evaluated using the modified U.S. Public Health Service criteria. The survival of the restorations was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. Factors affecting the occurrence of deficiencies were examined by logistic regression analysis. This was performed with the use of the Generalized Estimating Equation model including Repeated measurements (GEER), with the consideration that the same patient had several teeth in the sample. Risk estimation was conducted for each evaluated criterion (p < 0.05). Results The survival of LidiSi and RBC restorations were 96.8% and 84.9%, respectively after a mean observation period of 7.8 ± 3.3 years. The annual failure rate was 0.2% for LidiSi and 1.0% for RBC. The probability of survival was above 98% for both restorations in the first 6 years, however, it dropped to 60% for RBC by the end of the 15th year. For both materials the reasons for failure included secondary caries, restoration fracture, and endodontic complication. In addition, LidiSi also failed due to tooth fracture, while RBC due to marginal gap formation and loss of retention. Among the evaluated risk factors, material of restoration (OR=6.8, CI95%:3.1–14.9), oral hygiene (OR=8.0, CI95%: 2.9–22.1], and bruxism (OR=1.9, CI95%: 1.1–3.3) showed a significant impact on the evaluated criteria.

However, the specific application of BAGs produced through sol-gel synthesis in restorative dentistry has not been reviewed previously. This review provides a comprehensive account of the principles behind sol-gel derived BAGs and their investigation for dental tissue restoration materials. Methods A search for in vitro and in vivo studies was performed using the databases Web of Science®, Medline®, Scopus® and Google Scholar®. Articles published over the past 20 years were selected and data on the BAG composition and morphology was extracted. Analysis of the effect of specific BAG additives on the properties of experimental dental materials was also performed. Results A majority of BAG particles investigated were spheres ranging in size from 5 nm to 650 µm. Sol-gel BAGs are mainly applied in the treatment of hypersensitive dentine and for pulp-dentine tissue engineering, while a handful have been used in target drug delivery. BAG fillers are promising additives that result in improved biological properties, antibacterial effects, hardness, acid buffering and remineralization. Unfortunately, some detrimental effects on optical properties have been observed with BAG addition. Additionally, in vivo data, investigations into radiopacity and standardization of test protocols are identified as areas for improvement and further studies.

Methods An aromatic amine and benzoyl peroxide redox initiator system was partitioned between BAPO-photoinitiated BisGMA/HEMA adhesive and BisGMA/TEGDMA resin-composites. The composite was placed on the photocured adhesive layer with a brief delay before photopolymerization of the composite layer. Micro-tensile bond strength between the adhesive and composite was assessed in comparison with the non-redox active control materials. Results The presence of amine or peroxide in these resins without the redox initiation contribution enhanced both the rate and the final conversion of the BAPO-based photopolymerizations. Control formulations using redox-only initiation showed active polymer formation starting at approximately 30 s when physical mixing of the redox components was involved; however, simply by waiting 60 s between composite placement and photocure provided adequate time for passive interfacial diffusion of benzoyl peroxide from the pre-cured adhesive into the overlaid aromatic amine-containing composite such that a sufficient degree of redox initiated interfacial polymerization occurred prior to the composite photocure. The result was a significant increase in the adhesive to composite micro-tensile bond strength with the failure site moved away from the mainly interfacial failure noted for the control. Significance The stress-free autonomous pre-conversion of a redox-initiated thin film of composite that then provides a compositionally homogeneous interface for composite photopolymerization offers a means to enhance at least short-term bond strength between the adhesive and composite phases during restorative placement.","Dental materials, Composite restorative resin, Adhesives, Dentin bonding, Amine-peroxide redox polymerization, Interfacial polymerization",,

Methods Three-point bending tests were conducted to measure the viscoelastic parameters. These parameters are used to compute the residual stresses of the anterior crown after crystallization. In the next analysis, the cyclic loading on the anterior crown was calculated. Based on this combined stress state (residual stress and stress state due to external cyclic loading), the life cycle and fracture probability of the anterior crown was calculated using the CARES/Life software. Finally, fatigue experiments were carried out to compare and validate the results of the computations. Results Although a sound qualitative comparison of the lifetime of both materials can be done using this methodology, the calculated fracture probability of the anterior crown for both materials was very low in comparison with the fatigue test results using the fatigue parameters determined from the experiments. In order to achieve good correspondence with the experimental results, the SCG exponent n for both materials should be modified by a correlation factor of 0.38.

The aim of this research investigation is to determine, through a comparative cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment, the environmental impacts of three direct-placement dental restorative materials (DRMs) and their associated packaging. Methods Three direct-placement dental materials; dental amalgam, resin-based composite (RBC) and glass polyalkenoate cements (GIC) are assessed using primary data from a manufacturer (SDI Limited, Australia). The functional unit consisted of ‘one dental restoration’ of each restorative system under investigation: 1.14 g of dental amalgam; 0.25 g of RBC (plus the adhesive = 0.10 g); and 0.54 g of GIC. The system boundary per restoration included the raw materials and their associated packaging materials for each DRM together with the processing steps for both the materials and packaging. The environmental impacts were assessed using an Egalitarian approach under the ReCiPe method using Umberto software and the Ecoinvent database. Nine different impact categories were used to compare the environmental performance of these materials. Results Dental amalgam had the highest impact across most of the categories, but RBC had the highest Global Warming Potential. The highest sources of the environmental impacts for each restorative material were: Amalgam, derived from material use; RBC, derived from energy use in processing material and packaging material; GIC, derived from material and energy use for packaging. Significance Less intensive energy sources or more sustainable packaging materials can potentially reduce the impacts associated with RBC and GIC thus making them suitable alternatives to dental amalgam.","Environmental impacts, LCA, Dental amalgam, Dental composite, Glass ionomer cement, Dental materials, Sustainability",,

The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a novel multifunctional composite with antibacterial function and calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) ion release, and (2) investigate the effects on enamel demineralization and hardness at the margins under biofilms. Methods Dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) were incorporated into composite. Four groups were tested: (1) Commercial control (Heliomolar), (2) Experimental control (0% DMAHDM + 0% NACP), (3) antibacterial group (3% DMAHDM + 0% NACP), (D) antibacterial and remineralizing group (3% DMAHDM + 30% NACP). Mechanical properties and Ca and P ion release were measured. Colony-forming units (CFU), lactic acid and polysaccharide of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) biofilms were evaluated. Demineralization of bovine enamel with restorations was induced via S. mutans, and enamel hardness was measured. Data were analyzed via one-way and two-way analyses of variance and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Results Adding DMAHDM and NACP into composite did not compromise the mechanical properties (P > 0.05). Ca and P ion release of 3% DMAHDM + 30% NACP was increased at cariogenic low pH. Biofilm lactic acid and polysaccharides were greatly decreased via DMAHDM, and CFU was reduced by 4 logs (P < 0.05). Under biofilm acids, enamel hardness at the margins was decreased to about 0.5 GPa for control; it was about 1 GPa for antibacterial group, and 1.3 GPa for antibacterial and remineralizing group (P < 0.05). Conclusions The novel 3% DMAHDM + 30% NACP composite had strong antibacterial effects. It substantially reduced enamel demineralization adjacent to restorations under biofilm acid attacks, yielding enamel hardness that was 2-fold greater than that of control composites.

Methods FA rod-like crystals and bundles were hydrothermally synthesised and characterised by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 19F MAS-NMR. Composites were formulated containing BisGMA/TEGDMA/BisEMA and barium-aluminium-silicate glass (0FA). FA crystals were incorporated at 10 (10FA), 20 (20FA), 30 (30FA) and 40wt% (40FA) maintaining a filler content of 80wt% (63–67vol%). Degree of conversion (DC), flexural strength (FS), flexural modulus (FM), fracture toughness (K1C), Vickers hardness (HV) and 2-body wear were measured. Fluoride release was measured in neutral and acidic buffers. Results XRD and 19F MAS-NMR confirmed that only FA was formed, whilst SEM revealed the presence of single rods and bundles of nano-rods. DC ranged between 56–60% (p>0.05). FA composites showed lower FM and lower FS (p0.05) to 0FA. 30FA and 40FA showed similar K1C to 0FA (p>0.05), with SEM showing evidence of toughening mechanisms, whereas 10FA and 20FA showed lower K1C (p<0.05). FA containing composites released fluoride that was proportional to the amount of FA incorporated (p<0.05) but only under acidic conditions. Significance The addition of FA to the experimental composites reduced strength and stiffness but not the DC, hardness or wear rate. 30FA and 40FA had a higher K1C compared to other FA groups.

Methods A thorough literature review was conducted on the application and limitations of C-factor in stress analysis of dental restorations. This was principally based on MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases and a review of the relevant studies and publications in scientific papers in international peer-reviewed journals for the specific topic of C-factor and polymerization shrinkage. Results The C-factor alone cannot provide an accurate prediction of the shrinkage stress of restorations and the mechanical behavior of material-tooth interfaces. C-factor is only applicable under one condition not typically seen in clinical practice: low, near-rigid compliance.

Data Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) investigating direct and indirect resin composite restorations in posterior permanent teeth were considered. Sources Several electronic databases were searched, with no language or date restrictions. The revised Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB-2) was used to analyze the studies; meta-analyses were run and the certainty of evidence was assessed by the GRADE tool. A subgroup meta-analysis was performed for resin composite restorations placed on posterior worn dentition. Study selection Twenty-three articles were included in qualitative synthesis, while 8 studies were used for meta-analyses. According to the RoB-2 tool, 5 studies were ranked as “low risk”, 7 had “some concerns”, while 11 papers were rated as “high risk” of bias. There were no statistically significant differences in short-term (p = 0.27; RR=1.54, 95% CI [0.72, 3.33]), medium-term (p = 0.27; RR=1.87, 95% CI [0.61, 5.72]) and long-term longevity (p = 0.86; RR=0.95, 95% CI [0.57, 1.59]). The choice of restorative technique had no influence on short-term survival of resin composite restorations placed on worn dentition (p = 0.13; RR=0.46, 95% CI [0.17, 1.25]). The certainty of evidence was rated as “very low”. Conclusions Direct and indirect resin composite restorations may show similar clinical longevity in posterior region, regardless of the observation period or substrate (wear-affected and non-affected dentition). The very low quality of evidence suggests that more long-term RCTs are needed to confirm our results.","Longevity, Composite restoration, Systematic review",,

Methods Data on Class II restorations placed by one dentist between 1990 and 2016 were collected from patient files, including caries risk, tooth related variables, applied materials and dates of last check-up visit and restoration placement. Open sandwich restorations were placed before 2001, while after 2001, a total-etch technique using etch-and-rinse 3-step adhesive was used when placing a Class II composite restoration. For statistical analysis, Kaplan-Meier statistics and a multilevel Cox-Regression was conducted (p < 0.05). Annual Failures Rates (AFR) were calculated. Results 675 Class II restorations were placed in 91 patients, 491 total-etch restorations (observation time 2–18 y), and 184 open sandwich restorations (observation time 19–29 y) showing AFRs at 15 years as 2.9 % for total-etch and 9.7 % for open sandwich restorations. Secondary caries as failure was equally distributed among the 2 groups and 27 % of the failures in the open sandwich group were due to proximal deterioration of glass-ionomer cement. The Cox-regression showed a significant higher risk for failure for the open sandwich technique compared to total-etch class-II composite restorations (HR = 2.9; p < 0.001).

Methods Six BF and two non-BF resin-composites were selected. The unset pastes were inserted into white acetal molds (5mm id) with (n=6) depths (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6mm). Three light curing units (LCUs) of increasing radiant emittance capability: 1200, 2000 and 3200mW/cm2 were used. Composite specimen groups (n=3, per depth, per LCU) were irradiated on the upper surface only. For each specific composite, the irradiation times for each LCU were reduced reciprocally, as the LCU irradiance increased, to deliver a constant energy density (J/cm2) to that composite. However, the required energy density for a given composite differed in accordance with each composite manufacturer recommendations. After storing for 24h at 37°C, light transmission measurements were made through each specimen and re-expressed as Apparent Absorbance (A?). Vickers hardness (HV) measurements (n=10) were made on both top and bottom surfaces, for each specimen, and HV versus “depth” profile plots created. From the top-surface data, a Depth-of-Cure parameter could be derived. Data were statistically evaluated for differences between top and bottom HV values and for other predefined variables of interest. Results Irradiation with the LCU of 1200mW/cm2 generally gave the highest HV/depth for most materials tested compared to the other curing lights with higher power output, regardless of top and bottom measurements (p<0.001). However, this difference was material-dependent. With one BF composite, 1200 and 2000mW/cm2 irradiance did not show a significant difference between top and bottom HV. Composites with higher translucency showed reduced differences in top/bottom HV than more opaque composites. Significance Reciprocity was found to be limited with most materials examined, such that irradiance periods of 10s, gave generally better HV outcomes than by using LCUs of superior radiant emittance while reciprocally reducing irradiance time to maintain constant dose of energy density.","Bulk fill, Resin composite, Irradiation regimes, Exposure duration, Reciprocity, Vickers hardness, Hardness depth profile",,

Methods The continued failure of newly introduced RBRs to address biostability without compromising function, over the last decade, are presented as a rationale to support different resin-based concepts. Several developments in the field, aimed at addressing the issues facing modern resin-based systems are summarized and their limitations discussed. A design workflow is proposed for evaluating new RBR, considering resource needs. Results While several alternative resin chemistries have been suggested over the past decade, all have shown serious limitations in replacing MA-based materials, including their limited physical and mechanical properties, and curing kinetics. Additionally, a broad and inconsistent range of laboratory methods have been used to validate these developments, leading to results that are difficult to compare across studies. A design workflow was conceptualized to facilitate the screening of novel RBRs from both a clinical and research perspective. Significance While several alternative chemistries have shown some degree of potential in emulating material property aspects of MA-based resins, a complete restorative system that is resistant to biochemical reactions in saliva has yet to achieve broad clinical adoption. To further spur development, it would be useful to have a more systematic design workflow, that may be used to easily screen new resin technologies effectively early in the design phase, so as to mitigate potential performance failures in the clinic.","Resin-based restoratives, Biostability, Restorative failure, Resin design, Methacrylates",,

Methods For color analysis, 40 0.5mm thick feldspathic ceramic samples were obtained, and cemented onto 40 bovine teeth fragments using resin cements: RelyX Ultimate (RU) and RelyX Veneer (RV) (3M ESPE), and Gradia Direct (GD) (GC) and Palfique Lx5 (P) (Tokuyama) heated composite resins. The cemented samples were subdivided into 4 groups (n=10) and subjected to thermocycling (10,000 cycles). Color analysis was performed before and after thermal cycling (?E, ?L, CIEDE 2000). For the microhardness and diametral tensile strength tests, 80 specimens 6mm in diameter and 2mm in height were made with two resin cements (RU and RV) and two heated composite resins (GD and P). The samples were subdivided into 8 groups (n=10) and light-cured using two different ceramic sheets thicknesses (0.5 and 1.5mm). Knoop microhardness was performed on the top surface with 25g load for 15seconds, and diametral tensile strength on a universal testing machine at a speed of 0.5mm/min. Data were submitted to Tukey and Kruskal-Wallis tests at a significance level of 5%. Results For the color change data, there was no statistically significant difference between the cementing materials ?Eab (p = 0.572) or ?E00 (p = 0.503). Thermocycling significantly affected only L* (p = 0.047), which increased after the cycles. For parameters a* (p = 0.291) and b* (p = 0.256), there was no difference between the values measured before and after thermocycling. As for microhardness, GD composite resin presented significantly lower microhardness values than all other materials, at both ceramic thicknesses (p < 0.001). At a thickness of 1.5mm, RU cement had higher microhardness values than RV and P materials. Diametral tensile strength was significantly influenced by cementing agent (p = 0.010), but not by ceramic thickness (p = 0.555). Diametral tensile strength of GD composite resin was higher than that of the RU, but neither of these two materials differed from RV and P. Conclusion It was concluded that there was color stability of the materials used for luting after thermal cycling and that ceramic thickness influenced the mechanical properties microhardness, also diametral tensile strength of light-cured luting systems through ceramic laminates of different thicknesses.",,"Abstracts of the Academy of Dental Materials, Annual Meeting, Athens, Greece, 2022",

Methods Two ion releasing RBCs, Activa (ACT) and Cention-N (CN) were compared to a conventional RBC (Z350) and a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji-II-LC). The DoC was measured in a 10-mm deep semi-circular metal mold with a 2-mm internal radius (n = 8). The molds were irradiated from one end for 20-s. The Knoop hardness (KH) was measured at 0.5-mm intervals from the surface after the specimens had been stored at 37 °C for 24-h. To measure the KIC, single-edge-notched specimens (n = 15/group) were prepared (25×5x2.5-mm) for a 3-point bending test and then stored for either 1 or 30-days in water at 37 °C. Disk-shaped specimens (n = 10) were subjected to 250,000-load cycles of 49-N using a chewing simulator against spherical steatite antagonists. DoC and wear data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests (p ? 0.05). KIC data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and one-way ANOVA, and the Tukey post hoc test (p ? 0.05). In addition, an independent t-test was used to determine if storage time had any effect (? = 0.05) on the KIC of each material. Results Maximum hardness value was the highest for Z350 and the lowest for ACT. The depth at which 80% of the maximum KH, was the highest for CN (9.2 mm) and the lowest for Z350 (2 mm). All tested materials met the manufacturers’ claims for DoC. After 1-day, the highest KIC values were recorded for ACT and the lowest for Fuji-II-LC. Water storage (30-days) significantly reduced the KIC value for all materials except Fuji-II-LC. The highest wear rate values were recorded for CN followed by ACT. Significance All tested materials met their manufacturers’ claims for DoC. Water storage for 30-days significantly reduced the fracture toughness for ACT and CN. Wear was significantly higher for ACT and CN.","Resin composites, Ion release, Water storage, Depth of cure, Fracture toughness, Wear",,

In addition to (co)monomers, the analytical focus was on other potentially toxic ingredients or impurities. Furthermore, the barrier function of the residual dentin/adhesive layer was studied. Methods Six BF-RBC materials were studied. For each material subgroup, ten human third molar teeth with standard Class-I occlusal cavities were prepared and provided with a three-step adhesive system and the respective composite restoration (tooth groups). Same sized control specimens of the restorative material were prepared (‘direct BF-RBC’ groups). Each specimen was placed in an elution chamber such that the elution media (ethanol/water, 3:1) only contacted the tooth root or ¾ height of each specimen. They were incubated at 37 °C for up to 7 d. Samples of eluate were taken after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d and were analysed by high-temperature gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results (Co)monomers such as Bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate (bisEMA) or tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEEGDMA) were mostly found in the eluates of the ‘direct BF-RBC’ groups in statistically significantly greater amounts than in the eluates of the ‘tooth groups’. The residual dentin and/or adhesive layers acted as a diffusion barrier for most of the substances except for triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) or diethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA). For TEGDMA up to 3 orders of magnitude more were found in the ‘tooth groups’ compared to the ‘direct BF-RBC’ groups, evidently released by the adhesive system. Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) including TINUVIN® 328 and BPA were found mainly in the eluates of ‘direct BF-RBC’ groups. Significance For estimation of biocompatibility, a total system, specifically BF-RBC + adhesive, should always be investigated since individual considerations, such as only elution from a BF-RBC, do not correctly reflect the total clinical situation. The focus of elution tests should not only be on the co(monomers), but also on other ingredients or impurities that may be released.","GC/MS, BisEMA, Bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate, Dicyclohexyl phthalate, Drometrizole, Tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, Decan-1,10-diol dimethacrylate, BPA, TINUVIN, 328, Dentin barrier, Dentinal tubules, Elution, Bulk fill",,

This current review provides a critical analysis of the existing literature, particularly focusing on BAGs prepared via the melt-quench route that form an “apatite-like” phase when immersed in physiological-like solutions. Methods Online databases (Science Direct, PubMed and Google Scholar) were used to collect data published from 1962 to 2020. The research papers were analyzed and the relevant papers were selected for this review. Sol–gel BAGs were not included in this review since it is not a cost-effective manufacturing technique that can be upscaled and is difficult to incorporate fluoride. Results BAGs release Ca2+, PO43? and F? ions, raise the pH and form apatite. There are numerous published papers on the bioactivity of BAGs, but the different glass compositions, volume fractions, particle sizes, immersion media, time points, and the characterization techniques used, make comparison difficult. Several papers only use certain characterization techniques that do not provide a full picture of the behavior of the glass. It was noted that in most studies, mechanical properties were measured on dry samples, which does not replicate the conditions in the oral environment. Therefore, it is recommended that samples should be immersed for longer time periods in physiological solutions to mimic clinical environments. Significance BAGs present major benefits in dentistry, especially their capacity to form apatite, which could potentially fill any marginal gaps produced due to polymerization shrinkage.","Bioactive glass, Apatite, Ion release, Melt-quench, Restorative composite",,

Therefore, this study aimed to quantify BPA present as an impurity in both BPA-based and non-BPA-based monomers and to evaluate whether these monomers may degrade to BPA upon salivary, bacterial, and chemical challenges. Methods BPA was determined in three different amounts (1, 2, and 3 ?mol) of each monomer (TEGDMA, UDMA, mUDMA, BisGMA, BisEMA-3, -6, -10, -30, BisPMA, EBPADMA urethane, BADGE, and BisDMA). Next, the monomers (3 ?mol) were immersed in whole human pooled saliva collected from adults, Streptococcus mutans (2 × 107 CFU/mL), and acidic (0.1 M HCl), alkaline (0.1 M NaOH), and control media. The amount of BPA was quantified using a specific and highly sensitive UPLC–MS/MS method including derivatization of BPA by pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride. Results The monomers BisGMA and BisEMA-3 contained trace amounts (0.0006% and 0.0025%, respectively) of BPA as impurities of their synthesis process. BPA concentrations increased when the monomers BisGMA, BisEMA-3, BisEMA-6, BisEMA-10, BisPMA and BADGE were exposed to saliva and S. mutans, indicating degradation of a small amount of monomer into BPA. In addition, BisPMA and BADGE degraded into BPA under alkaline conditions. The conversion rate of the monomers into BPA ranged between 0.0003% and 0.0025%. Significance Impurities and degradation of BPA-based monomers may account for the release of BPA from resin-based dental materials. Even though the detected amounts of BPA due to monomer impurity were small, manufacturers of dental materials can reduce the BPA content by using only monomers of the highest purity. Considering the overall current trend towards BPA-free materials, it may be recommendable to investigate whether non-BPA based monomers can be used in dental resin-based materials.","Bisphenol A, Dental monomer, Impurity, Degradation",,

Methods Bovine incisors (n = 160) were ground flat on the labial surfaces to expose dentin using a grinder and silicon carbide (SiC) abrasive papers under running water. Between preparation and bonding procedures, the crowns were stored in Chloramine-T solution at 4 °C. Eight different restorative materials were studied: Activa BioActive (ABA), Cention Forte (CNF), Ceram.x Spectra ST (CXS), Riva self-cure (RSC), Equia Forte (EQF), Fuji II LC (FJI), Ketac Molar (KTM), Surefil one (SFO). Four materials required pretreatment of the dental hard tissue before placement, whereas the other four were self-adhesive (no pretreatment). The specimens were mounted vertically in plaster. A preload of 5 N was applied and the subsequent cross-head speed was 0.8 mm/min. Shear bond strengths (MPa) were calculated as the failure load divided by the bonding area. Failure modes were recorded as adhesive, cohesive or pretest. Data were statistically analyzed via ordinal regression for inference and Tukey’s method to adjust for multiple comparisons. All computations were done using R version 4.1.2 (R Core Team 2021). Results Smax (failure stress in MPa) of the combined groups with pretreatment were significantly higher than the self-adhesive materials. The highest frequency of pretest-failure was seen with FJI. Glass-ionomer cements without pretreatment were the only restoratives with pretest failures. Amongst materials without pretreatment, SFO had the highest bond strengths. Significance The further reduction of the placement steps for materials used as an amalgam alternative, namely the omission of pretreatment of the dentin, results in these self-adhesive materials having lower bond strengths than materials that require pretreatment of the dentin.","Dentin, Shear bond strength, Self-adhesive, Pretreatment",,
